# Transparency

All translations on this site are done using OpenAI’s GPT-4o model. Since the translations are primarily for my personal use, I make simple paraphrases when I notice obvious errors. For recurring mistakes, I update the prompt to correct them in subsequent chapters.

I purchase the chapters myself, costing about 100 KRW each. If you support me on Ko-fi, I'll use the funds to cover OpenAI’s costs and go towards new titles. You can find details on how to request new titles in the last paragraph. Translating one chapter with GPT-4o costs between 0.05 - 0.09 USD, depending on length.

When an official English translation of a series becomes available, I will remove the chapters to avoid infringement.

This site is built with [Hexo](http://hexo.io) and hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), meaning all content is stored as text files, which keeps it fast and doesn't require a database. Commenting is handled through GitHub issues, so users need to log in to GitHub to leave comments. GitHub Pages doesn't support cookies, so no user tracking is done.

Having said that, I've integrated [SimpleAnalytics](http://simpleanalytics.com), a privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics, to gather basic metrics like average time spent on a page and traffic sources (e.g., Google search, NovelUpdates). I use this information to make improvement. You can view the public SimpleAnalytics data here: [SimpleAnalytics Dashboard](https://dashboard.simpleanalytics.com/novel-zlood.github.io).

The source code for this site is open-source and available in the [repository](https://github.com/novel-zlood/novel-zlood.github.io). You can report errors, suggest improvements, or suggest new titles there by [opening an issue](https://github.com/novel-zlood/novel-zlood.github.io/issues).
