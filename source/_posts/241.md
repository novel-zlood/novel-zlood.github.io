“Deung Wi-pyeong, do you like it that much?”

Deung Jeong saw the unmistakable joy on the face of his grandson, Deung Wi-pyeong.

Though he was usually a cheerful child, today his smile was as radiant as a blooming flower in spring.

Deung Jeong somehow felt he knew the reason.

“Of course, Grandpa!”

“I never realized you liked meeting Hyun that much.”

“Grandpa, Kang Hyun is truly an amazing person! I wanted to go to the concert in Korea last time, but it clashed with the IMO dates, so I was really disappointed.”

Deung Wi-pyeong had won at the IMO (International Mathematics Olympiad).

Especially in 1999, known for its historically difficult problems, he won the gold medal with an overwhelming score difference.

Because of that, he was gaining fame as a math prodigy even in China. The authorities and Chinese math circles already regarded Deung Wi-pyeong as a mathematician who could surpass Grigori Perelman of the Soviet Union.

“What about Hyun makes you so happy? There are many excellent classical musicians in China, even if they aren't as good as Hyun.”

“Grandpa, Kang Hyun is really different from other musicians! Winning the Queen Elizabeth Competition as the youngest ever was amazing, but his career since then has been that of a genius among geniuses. I have a feeling that Kang Hyun will continue to grow endlessly. How could a violin enthusiast not admire such a person?”

Is it that geniuses recognize other geniuses?

Deung Jeong, a classical music enthusiast himself, had long known about Hyun's talent.

Not only did Hyun win the Queen Elizabeth Competition, where top violin talents from around the world gathered, at a young age, but he also received invitations to perform with the British Royal Family and famous orchestras worldwide.

There was no other musician in Asia who had a career like Hyun's.

“Hyung!”

Deung Wi-pyeong was ecstatic to see Kang Hyun at the wedding in New York.

Although he had been invited to a wedding in Beijing, he chose to go to New York without hesitation, largely because of Kang Hyun.

Despite the long flight, the fatigue vanished as soon as he saw Hyun's face.

“Deung Wi-pyeong?”

“It's so good to see you, Hyung!”

“It’s been a while. When did your Korean improve so much?”

“I studied a lot. Grandpa is now talking to someone else, so I came first!”

Though his Korean was clumsy, his dumpling-like face made it rather endearing.

* * *

“Hyung!”

It felt like I had become the Pied Piper again. Deung Wi-pyeong clung to me and showed no sign of letting go.

Though he had grown tall enough for the top of his head to reach my shoulder, his face remained the same. If anything, his baby fat showed no sign of disappearing, making his face adorably plump like a dumpling.

“Deung Wi-pyeong, what have you been up to lately?”

“Studying hard. I won last year!”

“Won?”

“I got a gold medal at the IMO, hehe.”

Though his Korean was clumsy, the meaning was clear. I knew Deung Wi-pyeong was smart, but I had no idea he had won a gold medal at the IMO. Now, his bright eyes seemed less like a child's innocent gaze and more like a distinguished mathematician's.

“I heard you’re working as a music director in Hollywood, Hyung? The news has even reached Beijing!”

“In Beijing?”

“Yes! Director Ji Lun is friends with my dad. Whenever they meet, they talk about you, Hyung. Director Ji Lun also wants you to be his music director because Director Tim Filmer praised you.”

Has the news already reached Beijing?

Who is Director Ji Lun? He’s a renowned director in China, as famous as Directors John Woo and Ang Lee.

Even globally, he is one of the top directors who want to work with me. And, of course, Director James Cameron also keeps in touch with me.

Life is full of surprises, but I never imagined I'd make such a name for myself in the film industry so quickly. It was then that I saw something surprising.

“Deung Wi-pyeong, is that the person Grandpa is meeting?”

“Yes!”

As I got closer, I could clearly see the Western man conversing with Deung Jeong. Indeed, Deung Jeong was no ordinary grandfather.

The person chatting amiably with Deung Jeong was none other than the Chief of Staff, often considered the second most powerful person in the White House.

Gulp.

I couldn't help but swallow hard. Despite my extensive involvement in politics in my past life, I had never met such a global power player. Today seemed to be the day.

* * *

Here.

‘Is this the White House?’

Even if the White House were hosting a party, it wouldn't be this grand.

Elnon Fox couldn’t hide his amazement as he observed the guests gathered at the grand mansion in the outskirts of New York.

Though he himself had been invited as a guest from the bride’s side, he hadn’t expected this. Not only were Chinese tycoons present, but also influential figures from America.

Elnon Fox himself was a well-known comedian in America, but his fame was like a firefly before the sun compared to these power players.

‘Chief Cloud?’

He was the second-in-command at the White House. Not only did he lead the advisors, but he was also a key figure in managing White House affairs.

The fact that he had attended the wedding in person and was having a long conversation with the groom was astounding. Indeed, the heir to one of China's most prominent companies!

At that moment,

‘Hyun?’

Elnon couldn’t believe his eyes. Kang Hyun, who was soon to appear as the first guest on his new talk show, had shown up at the wedding of the heir to the Geumwang Group.

As soon as Kang Hyun appeared, the heir to the Geumwang Group excused himself from his conversation with the Chief of Staff and hurried over to greet him. Naturally, the guests’ attention was drawn to this scene.

Who could command such respect that the heir to the Geumwang Group would leave the Chief of Staff to greet them?

The heir to the Geumwang Group conversed with Hyun in an incredibly friendly manner. Though I was standing at a distance, the surrounding silence made their conversation in Chinese clearly audible.

The heir not only chatted with Hyun like an old friend but also introduced him to his older sister, who was another key figure in the Geumwang Group.

How?

That wasn’t the end of it. After parting from the heir, a Chinese boy with dumpling-like cheeks immediately clung to Hyun. Given that the boy had been invited to the wedding, he must also come from a notable family.

Elnon wanted to approach Hyun, but he couldn’t find the right moment. Hyun was drawing as much attention as the heir to the Geumwang Group.

‘He knows that person too?’

Hyun was warmly greeting an elderly man known as the sage of China.

Tianjin’s Deung Jeong was someone Elnon also knew well. As a massive landowner, his family had held high-ranking positions in Tianjin for generations.

Even high-ranking officials in China reportedly bowed to his immense influence.

How do I know all this?

Besides being a comedian, Elnon also worked as a broadcast writer. He once worked on a Chinese travel program that introduced the landmarks of Tianjin.

It was during that time he came across this elderly man. The Chief of Staff, after chatting with the heir, had also gone straight to meet this elderly man.

The man warmly greeted Hyun and then introduced him to the Chief of Staff.

‘More than I thought.’

The Chief of Staff also looked at Hyun with interest. Naturally, as the heir to the Geumwang Group had left him to greet Hyun, he was intrigued.

Even to a stranger, it was clear that the heir and Hyun shared a special bond, so the Chief of Staff didn’t seem too displeased.

At that moment, Elnon realized. He had sensed it before at a charity event hosted by his boss, but it was just a hunch back then.

Now, seeing the attention and focus on Hyun at the wedding of the heir to the Geumwang Group, it was undeniable.

Kang Hyun, known as the violinist Hyun, was…

‘A much bigger deal.’
