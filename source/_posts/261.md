"What are you talking about?"

Viktor's brows furrowed deeply. The Sotheby's staff member's expression was not good. It was clear that some inexperienced kid had been rude without knowing anything.

However, Kang Hyun, staring intently at the Stradivarius 'Desiderio,' said, "The stability of the sound is slightly distorted."

Was he implying that a violin was like a car or something? In reality, there is a noticeable difference in sound between a cheap beginner's violin and an expensive one.

But the violin in front of them was a Stradivarius, one of the top three revered violins.

Moreover, it was an instrument with such a beautiful melody that it had enchanted Viktor, who was notoriously picky about music.

At that moment, Mikel, a Sotheby's employee, looked sharply at Kang Hyun.

"Violinist Hyun, with all due respect, the Stradivarius 'Desiderio' prepared by Sotheby's is undoubtedly genuine. It's disrespectful to both the Stradivarius and Sotheby's to judge the melody of Desiderio from just one touch of the bow on the strings without even playing it."

Mikel was adamant, showing no intention of tolerating Kang Hyun's rudeness any further. But Kang Hyun was equally resolute.

"If my judgment is wrong, I will apologize. But the melody of Desiderio was strangely lacking in resonance. To an untrained ear, it might sound deep and clear, but to me, it just felt like it was struggling to keep up. If the Stradivarius Desiderio in front of us is indeed genuine, then it would be considered a substandard work by Antonio Stradivari."

Mikel swallowed hard. What kind of ears did this man in front of him have to make such a definitive statement after just two touches of the bow on the strings?

"Visually, Desiderio certainly embodies the characteristics of a Stradivarius. The soundboard, which has gracefully transformed with age, and the selection of woods like willow, maple, and wisteria for various parts of the instrument, as well as the asymmetrical F-holes, all are in line with Stradivarius features. That's why I don't understand. How can an instrument that looks so perfect have such a poor melody? Don't you agree?"

"Violinist Hyun, your words are an insult to the entire Sotheby's."

Kang Hyun smirked. Wasn't he there to select violins as a violinist?

To him, one of the two Stradivariuses was in poor condition. If it wasn't broken, it felt like a replica.

Initially, he thought it might be a structural issue, but Mikel's wavering pupils made him certain. It was then that...

"Wait!"

Everyone froze at Viktor's voice. Viktor scrutinized Desiderio with his intense gaze. After a long examination, Viktor nodded briefly and said, "Call Mr. Hawk."

"Sir?"

Mikel was momentarily flustered but continued, "Excuse me, but Mr. Hawk won't come just because I call him."

"If you don't call him, I will."

At that moment, Mikel's expression twisted. He hadn't expected his name to be mentioned here.

Kang Hyun was puzzled. Who was this Hawk that Mikel was so shaken by?

Kang Hyun's gaze remained fixed on Desiderio. He wanted to stand up and play it right there.

If he could play it, he would surely find out whether it was genuine or not.

-The types of wood used in each structure, as well as the special chemicals added to the varnish made in northern Italy, have been meticulously reproduced. The curves and angles of the design, especially the asymmetrical F-holes and the engraved sides, exactly reflect the characteristics of a Stradivarius. The melody is just as beautiful. I have heard the melodies of the top three violins countless times, and they always sound wonderful. If Antonio Stradivari were alive, he would applaud this instrument for being such a well-made 'replica.'

Viktor gulped down his whiskey. The plane was leaving Italy, but Mr. Hawk's words still echoed in Viktor's mind.

-Accurate judgment requires precise machinery for age dating. It won't be resolved in a short time. But in my opinion, this is a very well-made replica. Even someone who has made violins for a long time would have a hard time recognizing it at a glance. Of course, all of this is off the record, you understand?

Mr. Hawk was a renowned instrument maker in Europe, so much so that he was called the Antonio Stradivari of the 21st century when it came to string instruments. Hawk continued inspecting the exterior and interior of Desiderio as he spoke.

-But how did you know? Even though I've encountered countless replicas, without a detailed inspection of both the exterior and interior, it's difficult to make such a judgment. This is indeed an extraordinary replica.

It was almost supernatural. He couldn't even touch the Stradivarius. He had only evaluated it by looking at it through a glass case.

Moreover, he had only touched the bow to the strings twice. Yet Kang Hyun had discerned whether it was genuine or fake just by listening to the sound.

Mikel, the Sotheby's employee, was immediately investigated by the police. It seemed even Sotheby's was unaware.

Had an ordinary person claimed to know whether the Stradivarius was genuine, no one would have listened. But two judges from the Queen Elisabeth Competition and a renowned European instrument maker backed him up.

-Switching genuine items with replicas at auctions has happened often throughout history. No matter how prestigious the auction house, you can't be entirely sure. Especially with artworks and instruments, it's hard to distinguish between genuine and fake unless you're an expert, and with replicas made this well, it's even harder. It's probably made by an unknown master. But really, how did you know?

Mr. Hawk asked again, genuinely puzzled. And no wonder, the Stradivarius 'Desiderio' was a perfect replica.

Even Mr. Hawk admitted that if he hadn't meticulously inspected both the exterior and interior, he would have been fooled.

"Glenlivet."

Viktor felt his throat burning. The fiery whiskey flowed down his throat, but instead of feeling hot, it felt cold.

He had been there too. But he didn't know, and the kid he had dismissed as a rookie recognized it immediately.

He felt ashamed. He had been momentarily enchanted by the melody of a replica. Was his hearing deteriorating with age? Kang Hyun's words came to mind.

-Even though it's a replica, it was an instrument with a beautiful melody. If it had its own name rather than the name Stradivarius, it would have been loved by many violinists. Also, if you had played Desiderio, you would have recognized it was a replica too, Mr. Viktor.

Viktor wasn't sure. Even if he had played Desiderio on the spot, he wouldn't have been as certain as Kang Hyun.

He began to see Kang Hyun, whom he had dismissed as an arrogant rookie, in a different light.

* * *

'I just knew.'

After returning from Italy, Kang Hyun had to face numerous questions. Not only from the judges of the Queen Elisabeth Competition but also from the Italian police.

The main question was the same: How did he know that the Stradivarius 'Desiderio' was a replica?

There was no way to explain it. The moment he heard the melody, it felt uncomfortable, like something was stuck in his throat.

He was sure after hearing it twice. If Desiderio wasn't broken, then it was a replica.

Moreover, in his past life, he had served as a chief prosecutor in the Western District Prosecutor's Office. It wasn't too difficult to read someone's intentions just by looking at their expressions, voices, and gestures.

Additionally, thanks to advanced software, his senses were sharper and more sensitive than before. He could detect the momentary emotional disturbance in Mikel from Sotheby's.

"Snore, snore."

Kang Hyun covered his ears. It had started again.

Every night, he couldn't sleep because of his roommate Viktor's snoring. Normally, he would have fallen asleep before Viktor did.

The room was spacious, but Viktor's snoring echoed like an orchestra in his ears.

"Sigh."

Kang Hyun reluctantly got out of bed and picked up his violin case. The sleepiness that had overwhelmed him vanished as if it were a lie.

"Hmm."

Viktor felt his throat burning as he got up. It must have been due to the over-drinking on the plane.

Outside the window, only the moonlight was shining dimly. But Kang Hyun was nowhere to be seen. It was then...

Buzz.

Hearing the melody coming from outside the mansion, Viktor unconsciously began to walk.

It was a mansion located near the chapel. Because of that, there was nothing outside but a spacious garden and a forest path, with not even a single streetlight. The melody was too loud and clear to be coming from the chapel.

Step, step.

Viktor walked, seemingly entranced by the melody. For a moment, Viktor rubbed his eyes roughly with his pajama sleeve, doubting what he saw.

Someone was there. The shoulders swaying gracefully in the pouring moonlight looked like a painting.

Moreover, the wind blowing through the forest acted as an accompaniment, making the melody richer and more beautiful.

Viktor hid behind a tree trunk, peeking at the performance like he was spying on a childhood crush.

'It's enchanting.'

If there was a feeling of true enchantment, this would be it. It made the enchantment he felt from Desiderio seem like a lie.

He wanted to see who it was. But the performer's face was hidden in the darkness.

Among the judges, there were only a few who still performed actively. Could it be the Japanese maestro Hirose?

Gulp.

Viktor swallowed hard. The previously serene melody surged into a passionate crescendo like rising waves.

The rustling leaves dancing in the wind added to the sound.

Viktor felt his emotions swell. He had listened to countless performances by rising violinists as a judge for the Queen Elisabeth Competition, but he had never felt this way.

As the passionate melody continued, Viktor's own emotions grew more intense.

At that moment, the moonlight revealed the performer's face clearly.

Viktor clutched the tree as if suffering from a sudden cramp. The leaves that had been dancing in the wind stopped and drooped, looking at Viktor.

His eyes trembled violently, as if witnessing something unbelievable. The performer who had enchanted him was...

"Hyun?"

It was the rookie kid.
