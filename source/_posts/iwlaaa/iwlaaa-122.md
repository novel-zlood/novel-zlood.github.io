Psychology.

As an actor, studying a script isn't the only thing you do. Just as numerous notes are added to a thesis, countless side notes are inevitably necessary for even the smallest performance.

One of those side notes was psychology.

For the past few days, Youngguk has been engrossed in reading works by famous psychologists like Freud and Gustav Jung. He started reading to understand the behavior of Baekjeong Igyul, but it wasn't just about delving into books.

"Professor, if you have time, may I ask you a question?"

After the criminal law mock trial exam, Youngguk visited Professor Shin Jeonggil's office.

The elderly professor with white hair gave a kind smile and offered a seat. He then poured some warm tea and added,

"Student Jang Youngguk, what brings you here right after the exam? Are you curious about the legal answers to the test questions?"

Youngguk wanted to know about criminal psychology. Baekjeong Igyul clearly heard his brother's last will. However, he didn't accept it and didn't head straight to the palace.

It was the process of transforming into the worst tyrant in Joseon history.

"Criminal psychology..."

The old professor's eyes narrowed intriguingly.

"That's an interesting question. As you said, there are often criminals whose personalities change suddenly. Although people say that humans can control their emotions and thoughts, from a legal scholar's perspective, I don't think that's true at all. For example, consider the Mangwon-dong murder case in 1987. A child who suffered domestic violence killed his family. Despite being beaten for years, one day, his suppressed anger exploded, and he not only killed his parents but also his grandmother, who had raised him lovingly."

The professor took a sip of tea and continued.

"When I first took on this case at the Western District Court, there were many puzzling points. Could it really be true that the juvenile offender killed not only his parents but also his beloved grandmother? There are various types of murder: retaliatory, power-based, and expressive. The only type that seemed to fit the juvenile offender was retaliatory. But we couldn't immediately find an answer because we didn't understand why he killed his grandmother."

The professor's eyes seemed lost in the past.

"Even the prosecutor couldn't deduce the answer. The public defender representing the juvenile offender was the same. In the end, as a judge, I couldn't suppress my curiosity and asked in the courtroom. Why did you mercilessly kill your grandmother, who took care of you so dearly? The juvenile offender, who had exercised his right to remain silent, suddenly spoke. And the answer was simple and clear. Because she was a bystander."

The sound of the teacup being placed down brought Youngguk back to the present.

"The day I sentenced that juvenile offender to death while wearing my judicial robes was the first time. Nowadays, the juvenile law has been strengthened, so we can't sentence someone to death. Youngguk, do you know what that child said to me as he walked out of the courtroom?"

Youngguk thought it must have been emotions like anger or revenge.

But the answer that followed sharply deviated from Youngguk's thoughts.

"He said, 'Thank you.' The juvenile offender regretted it. He regretted not only killing his parents with his own hands but also mercilessly killing his grandmother, who had raised him like a precious jewel. Though many years have passed, I still occasionally remember the look in the boy's eyes as he walked out of the courtroom."

The set began to come into view outside the car window. When the vehicle stopped, Youngguk closed the psychology book he had been reading.

Entering the dressing room on set, he saw the costume he would wear today. It was the royal robe worn by Yeonsangun Ilyung.

Now, Baekjeong Igyul would wear that robe and control the court in place of his brother.

"The character Youngguk mentioned must also be going through a similar transitional period as that juvenile offender. Human emotions are not like a machine; they don't open and close with the push of a button."

Youngguk's mind echoed with the professor's last words as he donned the royal robe.

"A famous psychologist once said, human emotions cannot be controlled, and that's why we feel regret."

* * *

"Youngmin, give Youngguk some time."

The famous PD grabbed AD Kim Youngmin's shoulder. Normally, the AD would take over directing the movements on set, but this was not the time.

The PD nodded towards the puzzled Kim Youngmin.

"Look at Youngguk now. He's so focused; we can't break his concentration."

Soon, they would be shooting a scene that required deep emotions. It was a scene where the character had to gradually express his pent-up feelings.

In a way, it was a turning point in the drama. It was the first scene where the public would see the well-known image of the tyrant.

"Phew."

At that moment, Youngguk was organizing his complicated thoughts. Since the crank-in, he had been continuously reading the script.

Thanks to Professor Shin Jeonggil, he had somewhat resolved the psychological state of Baekjeong Igyul, which had seemed elusive.

However, he wasn't sure if he could perform well. After all, this was the first time he was portraying a character with such rapidly changing emotions.

"Am I growing?"

It was a feeling he had experienced many times in his life. The fact that he was gradually growing through acting.

Youngguk felt this emotion every time he filmed "Yeonsan, The King's Secret."

After all, this was almost his first time playing a dual role. He had to portray characters with different personalities, emotions, and even speech styles as if they were one.

The lights on the set began to turn on one by one. It was almost time for the cue sign.

In Gangnyeongjeon, the king's chamber, Baekjeong Igyul's eyes were bloodshot.

It was the death of his only brother. He couldn't even honor his brother's last will by holding a proper funeral.

He buried him in a small mound in Gyeongsanggol, promising to move the remains someday.

There wasn't even an official to shout the mourning rituals from the roof, and the only sound at the funeral was the low hooting of an owl instead of wailing.

It was a pitiful funeral for the death of a king, who was called the father of a nation.

"Your Majesty, shall I serve you a late-night snack?"

With the voice of a court maid, a little maid entered Gangnyeongjeon. In her small hands, she carried a tray with snacks and tea.

There was no fear on the maid's face as she approached the king's chamber, as it was rumored that Yeonsan pitied the maids.

But then,

"Take it back."

Startled by the sudden command, the maid peeked up. At that moment, she met the king's bloodshot eyes and gasped.

"Send the maid away and summon the chief guard immediately."

The court official hurriedly helped the maid up and led her out. The atmosphere was so tense as if something serious could happen at any moment.

The official left Gangnyeongjeon without showing his back, bowing respectfully.

Soon after, the chief guard Kim Hoin entered Gangnyeongjeon.

"How is the state of the Gyeomsabokjang?"

"The physician said his life is not in danger, but he will have limited movement for a while, Your Majesty."

The chief guard Kim Hoin, bowing his head, looked puzzled.

What could have happened for the king's close guard to be seriously injured? Moreover, the atmosphere in Gangnyeongjeon was tense.

"Chief guard, summon Im Sahong to the palace immediately."

"I will carry out your orders."

In the empty Gangnyeongjeon, Baekjeong Igyul stared into space with bloodshot eyes.

The palace was serene as if nothing had happened. In front of him, he vividly remembered the dying gaze of his brother, who held his hand as he passed like a fading light.

The staff watching the scene beyond the set held their breath like the maid serving the king. Tears streamed down from Youngguk's bloodshot eyes.

"Your Majesty, Im Sahong has arrived."

With the chief guard, Im Sahong entered Gangnyeongjeon. Im Sahong was bewildered by the sudden royal summons.

Baekjeong Igyul knew Im Sahong.

He was the man who had argued with him in a tavern on the day of the former king's funeral procession.

A man who had mistaken him for the crown prince and bowed to the ground.

"I have something for you to do."

"Your Majesty, command me...!"

Nostrils flaring, Im Sahong bowed flat on the ground. Instinctively, he knew the gravity of the situation. Baekjeong Igyul looked down at the treacherous man.

He had heard about Im Sahong from his brother. But regardless of whether he was a traitor or not, it didn't matter. He just needed a reason for the blade he wielded.

"Chief guard, gather all the soldiers of the Geumgunsancheong immediately."

Kim Hoin's eyes widened. Geumgunsancheong referred to the combined forces of the Naegeumwi, Gyeomsabok, and Urimwi, who guarded the royal palace.

Mobilizing all the soldiers of the Geumgunsancheong meant there was a significant crisis within the palace.

"Im Sahong, you know how my mother died."

"Your Majesty...! Please kill me. I lacked the power to help the queen consort at the time!"

"Enough. The official reason will be that you told me the truth about my mother’s death. Understand?"

"...!"

'What is he planning?'

Im Sahong's face turned pale. On the other hand, Igyul’s face flushed.

Was it due to anger, or was he suppressing sorrow? It was hard to tell.

Mother’s death?

Igyul had heard about his mother's death from his brother. But he didn't feel anger about the death of a mother he had never seen.

Instead, the emotion welling up deep inside him was because of his brother, who had died in his place.

Igyul stood up, his civilian clothes fluttering. Im Sahong, feeling as if his throat could be cut at any moment, lay flat on his face.

With bloodshot eyes, Igyul thought of his brother. His brother, who had told him to live in his stead.

But he couldn't do that. As he thought of his brother's corpse buried in an unmarked mound, he tasted a strong scent of blood in his mouth. He would give that same blood scent to those who had made his brother suffer.

"Chief guard, listen. From now on, those who conspired against me..."

Igyul spoke firmly to the chief guard bowing before him.

"Will be executed."

The signal for the tyrant had been fired.
