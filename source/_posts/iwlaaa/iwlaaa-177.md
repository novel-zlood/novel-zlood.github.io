Time flows like a river.

Before we knew it, the day to broadcast the making film had arrived. Broadcasting a making film for pre-promotion of a drama was an unusual occurrence. Therefore, it attracted keen interest not only from the general public but also from the broadcasting industry.

"Isn't it like a documentary?"

Producers from other broadcasting stations were bad-mouthing among themselves about the pre-promotion making film conducted by M Broadcasting. This was because using a making film as a pre-promotion video was absurd in the current Korean drama scene.

"I just don't get why they would broadcast such a thing. If not careful, the contents could be leaked before the main broadcast even starts, and even if it goes well, what interest would a documentary video attract?"

"Producer Park, exactly my point. By promoting with a making film for no reason, it might bring trouble to us too. It's already hard enough to adjust the pre-recording schedule, when do we have time to care about making films?"

"Let it be. MBS needs to fail big this time to come to their senses. I heard the producer in charge is a newbie and it's his debut work? The deputy director who approved the making film also just got promoted to CP this time, so they are bound to mess up."

On the rooftop, cigarette smoke rose in curls, and the producers' bad-mouthing and laughter didn't stop. Meanwhile, Producer Kim Jin, who stood alone on one side of the rooftop, had different thoughts.

'Those guys don't know.'

Kim Jin had experience working with Youngguk in the past. Jang Youngguk was not someone who could be evaluated as just an actor.

Working together on set, one could see how knowledgeable he was about drama and film direction, and how he was drawing a broad blueprint.

Even Kim Jin himself had sought many pieces of advice from Youngguk during filming.

'I shouldn't have missed him back then!'

It was all because of the old folks. The elders who just sat in the upper echelons of the broadcasting station and aged without doing anything.

Though the word "if" cannot be used in life, what if they had given Youngguk the grand prize at the SBC Acting Awards? How would things have turned out by now?

"Get Jang Youngguk back somehow!"

It was a line repeated by the drama department head and the drama headquarters director until their mouths were worn out.

But how could one stop a bus that had already left? Now it wasn't just a bus, it was at the level of an airplane. Youngguk's status had risen so high that it couldn't be compared to three years ago.

The same was true for this drama's pre-promotion. If it were an ordinary actor, it wouldn't have become such a hot topic. People would have thought it was just another reckless move by the broadcasting station.

However, the mere inclusion of the name Jang Youngguk drew immense attention. Kim Jin could feel it instinctively.

'This is definitely going to be a hit.'

Kim Jin licked his dry lips. The more he thought about it, the more he regretted missing out on Youngguk.

"Director, it's not even the main broadcast, why are we all watching the pre-promotion video together?"

Actor Park Sooyoung visited Songwon Entertainment late at night. It was to watch the pre-promotion video of the drama "Mermaid Prince."

The conference room was already filled with representatives, including CEO Kim Sunghwan and all the agency staff.

"You even ordered fried chicken?"

In response to Park Sooyoung's question, Kim Sunghwan handed her a chicken drumstick.

"You know the saying, 'Even Gold Mountain comes after a meal.' Park, sit down and have a chicken leg. This place is famous for its garlic fried chicken."

"Don't you know I'm on a diet for my next project? Oh, Minjung, you're here too? Oh, Jaekyung is here too?"

Park Sooyoung's eyes widened seeing other actresses already eating the chicken. The combination of actresses and dieting was an inseparable fate. Any weight gain would immediately show on the screen.

"How can you eat like this when you know you have to make a bone-crushing effort to look good on screen?"

"Why kill their spirits, Park? The representative says it's fine. And what's the matter if you gain a little weight, you can lose it again."

"Yes, we can lose it again. You talk as if you'll lose it for us."

Park Sooyoung clicked her tongue. Kim Sunghwan, the CEO of Songwon Entertainment, was different from other entertainment agency CEOs. If it were another agency, they would have only given them nutrient-less greens and squeezed them until they were bone-thin.

But she liked that. Every little thing showed that they were being treated as human beings, not just commodities.

"It's starting!"

At someone's shout, everyone's attention turned to the large screen on the central wall of the conference room. Park Sooyoung also sat next to CEO Kim Sunghwan and focused her gaze.

"A making film..."

Even for Park Sooyoung, who was building her filmography by crossing the broadcasting and film industries, this was the first time she had heard of a drama making film. In the film industry, making films were still very rare.

"Will it do well?"

There's a saying in the broadcasting industry: it's either a big hit or a complete bust. There's no middle ground. The same applies to broadcasting a making film as a pre-promotion video.

But her worries vanished as the making film started airing.

"Wow..."

Against the backdrop of an emerald sea, a man was swimming.

Schools of fish swam around him, and he moved among them as if he were the mermaid prince, just like the title of the drama.

Soon, as he smiled under the brilliant sunlight while coming ashore, everyone couldn't help but be amazed.

"It's like a photo shoot."

As someone said, it wasn't an ordinary making film. It captured every moment of Youngguk on set, almost as if it was made by Jang Youngguk's fan club.

The direction was so exquisite that it made the viewers think it was a photo shoot advertisement rather than a making film.

Gulp.

Even though it was a one-hour making film, no one thought of chatting and were completely absorbed. The highlight, however, came at the very end.

Actress Park Sooyoung dropped the chicken leg she had cautiously picked up, at the sight of Youngguk jumping off a cliff without hesitation.

[Drama 'Mermaid Prince' pre-promotion making film hits bigâ€•!]

[M Broadcasting company flooded with calls to air 'Mermaid Prince' sooner!]

[Critic Kim Jaecheol: 'Mermaid Prince will mark a milestone in Korean drama history.']

The pre-promotion making film of "Mermaid Prince" was a huge hit. Especially the cliff scene aired at the end was the highlight.

The accident scene was edited out, so everyone who watched the making film thought it was just part of the drama scene.

"Raise it when you go down, and let's try again. It needs to look like a prince on a white horse. Pay attention to the angle as we will move from the rear to the side!"

Meanwhile, the filming site was bustling with energy regardless of the making film's response.

Kim Woo-hyung was busy running around the filming site. He was meticulously rehearsing everything from the directing movements, the lighting, to the width of the track for the inside work.

"Producer, you're overflowing with passion."

"Oh, Youngguk. When did you get here?"

"I've been here for a while, reading the script. You seemed busy directing the set, so I couldn't say hello."

"I'm out of my mind. Did you see the making film? The response is crazy. Calls have been flooding in since last night. Even the vice president contacted me directly. He said he has high expectations for this project, oh, don't even get me started. It just adds more pressure."

Despite his words, he looked quite pleased. No wonder, getting attention from his debut work and a direct call from the vice president of the broadcasting station was a big deal.

"By the way, Youngguk. Isn't your movie releasing in Hong Kong shortly after our main broadcast?"

Youngguk nodded briefly. The film "Autumn Wind Poem," which he shot with the Hong Kong film giant Director Wang Jinyang, was also set to release soon. He would have to devote himself to filming the drama while traveling between Korea and Hong Kong.

"At this rate, you might win a big award at an international film festival."

"You're putting me on a pedestal too soon."

"What pedestal? Director Wang Jinyang was the top director in Hong Kong in my time. It's a real pride that you're the lead in such a renowned director's comeback film. Also, it's still like a dream that you're starring in our drama."

The film "Autumn Wind Poem" indeed won several awards at international film festivals as it marked the grand return of Director Wang Jinyang.

However, there was no news about the actors winning. This might be because the main point of "Autumn Wind Poem" was the beautiful visuals showcasing Hong Kong's colors rather than the actors' performances.

"By the way, there's a kiss scene today, right? Did you brush your teeth well?"

"It's just a peck, not a kiss."

"A peck is still a kiss. Aren't you secretly looking forward to it?"

Kim Woo-hyung squinted his eyes playfully. At that moment, Yeonsu arrived at the filming site. Youngguk used the excuse of greeting her to quickly leave.

"Oppa, did you watch the making film yesterday?"

Yeonsu started by asking if he had watched the making film, forgetting to greet him. Unfortunately, Youngguk, who had been filming, shook his head.

"Right, you had a night shoot yesterday."

"How was the making film?"

"It was amazing. The making film itself was like a photo shoot. Although I looked good too, it seemed like it was edited focusing on you. That producer must be your fan. And thank you."

"For what?"

Yeonsu lowered her head shyly and added.

"I didn't know you jumped off a cliff like that. I knew you saved me, but seeing it in the video made it real."

"Forget about it. If you're thankful, be nice to me from now on."

Youngguk patted Yeonsu's head. He didn't want her to feel burdened by that day's incident anymore.

Of course, if such a situation occurred again, Youngguk would save her without hesitation. Just then,

"By the way, today is the third time, right?"

"Huh?"

"The kiss scene."

What was she talking about? Youngguk thought hard. This was the first time he was filming a kiss scene with Yeonsu. To be precise, it was closer to a light peck.

"Once at the pier, and once when you saved me. Do the math, it's the third time, right?"

So she remembered. Youngguk rubbed his nose and nodded briefly. At that moment, Yeonsu approached.

Smooch.

Yeonsu kissed Youngguk's cheek and smiled mischievously.

"This is a rehearsal."
