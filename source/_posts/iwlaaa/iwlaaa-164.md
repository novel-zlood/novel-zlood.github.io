Grand Prize (大賞).

The president of the broadcasting station personally steps up to the microphone. He slyly glances at the paper with the winner's name and smiles. Then, without hesitation, he announces,

“The Grand Prize winner of the MBS Drama Awards is none other than Jang Youngguk!”

All live broadcast cameras focus on one spot. With the spotlight on him, Youngguk, dressed in a pure white suit, shows a bewildered expression.

Even though his name was called, he still couldn't believe it. If there were no cameras, he might have slapped his own cheek to see if it was a dream or reality.

‘Really, me, winning the Grand Prize?’

The impact of <Yeonsan, the King's Secret> was tremendous. It shook the traditional historical drama landscape so much that the new term "fusion historical drama" was coined. Furthermore,

46.7%

The highest viewership rating was also record-breaking in the broadcasting station's history. However, he hadn't been confident about winning the Grand Prize. Despite his intense passion for acting throughout his life, he had only managed to win the Best Actor award before.

What snapped him out of his thoughts was none other than the congratulations from his colleagues.

Starting with Cha Hyejin, who played the role of Jang Noksu, Gwak Jungwoo, who played the bodyguard, and even Park Sangcheol, who played Kim Cheoseon.

Feeling a push on his shoulder as if urging him to go up, he received endless applause and cheers.

“Actor Jang Youngguk, who portrayed both King Yeonsan and the fictional character Lee Gyeol in <Yeonsan, the King's Secret>, created a fusion historical drama syndrome through his acting as if he were the real King Yeonsan. He left a strong impression on the public with his wide range of roles hidden behind his pure smile. Congratulations!”

As he received the award plaque, the host made witty remarks.

Holding the golden, radiant award plaque and standing in front of the stand microphone, he saw his fellow actors and numerous audience members.

All the live broadcast cameras were focused on one spot.

“I can't believe I'm standing here. I have a lot to say, but today I won't give a speech just for myself. As a young person, saying such things might come off as arrogant. I have appeared in many works and received a lot of love. So much love that I wonder if I deserve it.”

Everyone listened intently to Youngguk's acceptance speech.

“It takes the effort of many people for one person to shine. This award I receive is no different. It's not the result of my efforts alone, but thanks to the many staff members and fellow actors working hard behind the scenes. Because of them, I can stand here and receive so much love.”

His past mistakes and regrets came to mind. Didn't he live his life thinking he was the best? He worked so hard, earning the nickname "madman of acting," because he wanted to break the cycle of poverty.

At that time, he didn't know. That success wasn't achieved alone.

“I will continue to strive to be a beloved actor. I thank my family in Yeongdo who might be watching this, my agency family, the producer and writer of <Yeonsan, the King's Secret>, my colleagues, and all the fans who always believe in and love me. Lastly,”

Dressed in a pure white suit, Youngguk bowed deeply towards the live broadcast camera.

“I was truly happy to be King Yeonsan Lee Yong and Lee Gyeol this past year.”

As soon as his acceptance speech ended, the screen showed this year's award-winning work from MBS Broadcasting.

The screen was filled with the image of Lee Gyeol.

-A new king has ascended, so you must also walk a difficult path. If the sword of the court does not reach you today, I will at least be able to save face with my brother. Geomsabokjang, may I make one last request of you?

The wind blows on the place of exile.

-Please speak.

His eyes, swaying in the sea breeze, are zoomed in. Despite facing death, he shows no sign of fear or tension. At that moment, the sunlight shines down, and the sea's waves stop.

-After I die, cut off a lock of my hair and bury it next to my brother.

As he collapses, only a strange seagull sings a mournful tune.

The bodyguard, throwing away his bloodied sword, holds his collapsing body.

His dying gaze, as if telling the wailing bodyguard not to be sad, barely manages to smile.

* * *

What is acting? Is it innate talent or effort? Actor Song Jungseok felt a lump in his throat watching Youngguk's acceptance speech on the television.

He still had a motto ingrained in his mind like a belief.

-If you meet someone like me later, don't just pass by, but help them. A warm bed and a bowl of rice—what's so special about that?

He was a child. A kid who said he was a fan and gave him a feast and a warm bed when he was struggling with minor roles.

That child's good deed became the foundation of Song Jungseok's acting until now.

‘Well done, Youngguk.’

The actor Jang Youngguk he knew was someone who helped others on the set more than any other actor.

As popularity rises and fame grows, it's natural to become arrogant. Young actors especially tend to do so more.

But Youngguk was different. Not only did he laugh and chat with supporting actors and freely share acting advice, but he also rolled up his sleeves and volunteered to help whenever something happened on set.

Because of this, there wasn't a single bad rumor about Youngguk in the broadcasting world or Chungmuro. Everyone who worked with Youngguk, from minor actors to staff, all spoke in unison.

A genius and the hardest-working actor.

As the saying goes, you can tell a promising tree from its buds. Song Jungseok, who witnessed Youngguk's acting as a child, had a premonition that he would become an incredible actor.

He had a feeling he would become an outstanding actor, but he didn't expect him to win the Grand Prize at such a young age.

Today would be a more monumental day than any other celebration. Although it was someone else's award, his face flushed as if he had won it himself.

Song Jungseok shouted as he watched Youngguk bowing to the viewers on the screen.

“You rascal, congratulations!”

At that moment,

Yeonsu was nervously watching the screen.

She knew that Youngguk's award was once overturned due to pressure from the higher-ups of the broadcasting station during a past drama, <Youth>.

She was secretly tense, wondering if it might happen again this time. But when Youngguk's name was called as the Grand Prize winner, she jumped up without realizing it.

“Oh my!”

Her mother, who was watching the live broadcast of the drama awards with her, looked at her daughter in surprise.

“Yeonsu, are you that happy?”

Her mother asked as she looked at her daughter's tear-filled eyes. Yeonsu nodded vigorously, her eyes shimmering with tears. Although it wasn't her award, her face looked like she was the one standing on the podium.

Her mother felt both proud and somehow sad seeing her daughter like that.

Yeonsu's mother had also watched Youngguk grow up. Didn't she personally take on the role of a manager to fulfill her daughter's dream of becoming an actress?

Traveling across the country for filming locations year-round isn't an easy task.

Especially for a child. That's the nature of being a child actor. If her daughter didn't have the persistence and certainty about acting, she would have stopped her long ago.

What she encountered back then was Youngguk in his childhood.

He was a small boy with a buzz cut like a chestnut, but his speech and attitude towards others were as mature as any adult.

She couldn't not know that her daughter liked such a Youngguk. However,

‘He thinks of her as a younger sister.’

It was clear how Youngguk thought of Yeonsu. As a mother, she want her daughter's first love to have ended well, but seeing her daughter liking him so much made her feel conflicted.

On the other hand, she also felt proud seeing Youngguk on the screen.

The little boy who grew up in Yeongdo with his mother alone was now a sturdy man holding up the Grand Prize trophy.

“You've grown up very well.”

* * *

“Youngguk! Come drink a glass with me!”

Cinematographer Kim Deukhyeong approached with a green bottle of alcohol. He had already had several glasses. Kim Deukhyeong was already quite drunk, his nose reddish, but the after-party showed no signs of ending.

From the famous PD to writer Choi Eunsook and all the staff and actors, they had to rent an entire restaurant.

“Drinking like this reminds me of when we had a drink at the tavern in Yeongdo! That makgeolli was really killer. Youngguk, do you remember?”

“Director, I couldn't drink back then, so I only had cola!”

“Really? I always thought you were much more mature than your age. You've grown up so fast. Shall we sing some trot for old times' sake?”

The cheerful atmosphere continued. After winning the Grand Prize, everyone came together to celebrate me. The famous PD hugged me lightly with a big smile.

The after-party ended late at night.

“Phew.”

When I returned home, my grandfather and uncle welcomed me. After receiving their congratulations and my uncle's suggestion to drink together, my grandfather stopped him, allowing me to barely make it to my second-floor bedroom.

Lying on the bed, the Grand Prize trophy in my hand still didn't feel real. It felt like all of this was a dream.

“I really won the Grand Prize.”

Even in my previous life, where I was crazy about acting, I had never imagined such a scene.

Laughter burst out like I had gone mad. And tears flowed from my eyes unknowingly.

After lying down holding the golden trophy for quite some time, I got up to call my mother.

Although I had called her right after winning the award, I couldn't talk to her properly because she was with the merchants' association.

-Youngguk!

Since it was late, I thought she would be sleeping, but she answered as if she had been waiting for my call, even before the ringtone had rung a few times.

My mother and I cried silently. There was no need to repeatedly say congratulations because we understood each other's feelings.

-Youngguk, I am truly

My mother, barely holding back her emotions that were on the verge of overflowing, spoke in a choked voice.

-I am so proud of you. There's nothing more I could ask for. Truly

I recalled my past life, where I ended it like a moth flying towards a faint light.

I tried to live a happy life. I put aside my desire to see the end of acting as an actor. There were times when I wondered if I was on the right path.

But now I knew. That I was on the right path.

When my mother said there was nothing more she could ask for, I couldn't help but feel choked up.

Tonight, it seemed like I wouldn't be able to sleep easily. The moonlight quietly shone on me through the window. And,

Three years passed after that.
