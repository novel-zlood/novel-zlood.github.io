"Puahaha―!"

A hearty laugh echoes, enough to shake the stones on the Go board. An Joonghyeon wipes away a tear and says,

"Youngguk, that rascal, got hit right on the back of the head!"

"A nephew shouldn’t be this happy..."

"No, just imagining Youngguk’s flustered face is funnier than any sitcom. He’s always been an old soul, but sometimes he feels like he’s my peer."

White and black stones are placed endlessly on the Go board.

Suddenly, a fierce storm hits the once calm Go board. The upper left corner turns completely white in an instant.

The look of triumph is evident on An Joonghyeon's face.

"Where did the Go player go?"

Baek Janghoon's eyes, glaring at the Go board, are sharper than ever.

"Hyung, how about just stopping and throwing in the towel? I’ve always been confident in ball games since I was young. I’ve never had to order jajangmyeon with my own money at the billiard hall."

He even teases, calling Go a ball game just because the stones are round.

He tries to find a clever move, but it’s not visible. It’s truly a dead end. The wrinkles deepen as he calculates each move.

In the end, Baek Janghoon glances back, looking for someone. Seeing this, An Joonghyeon protests,

"Hey, that’s a foul. Don’t call Youngguk."

"Ahem."

"Thinking about last time still makes me jump out of bed at night. That rascal must have secretly taken Go lessons. Otherwise, he couldn’t have toyed with me, the representative of Go in Chungmuro. And by the way, Youngguk already left. The bus has already passed."

No wonder the advisor isn't seen. Baek Janghoon shakes his head.

But he can’t throw the stones just yet. As a man, he must see it through to the end.

Clack!

What seemed to be an easy end shows no sign of concluding. It’s a brilliant move born of Baek Janghoon's stubbornness. As the black stones persistently engage in the battle, An Joonghyeon finally sighs and says,

"By the way, hyung, have you thought of any actors suitable for the script?"

Baek Janghoon, staring at the Go board, shakes his head. Despite reviewing the script and having detailed conversations with the writer, no specific actor comes to mind.

It’s likely because the character’s image is so diverse. Sometimes comedic, other times serious, and even occasionally savage.

"I thought you already had a few candidates in mind. Aren’t you well-acquainted with most Chungmuro actors?"

"The puzzle is complex, making it harder to fit."

"How about me then? Working with you again after all this time would bring back old memories and be nice."

The unexpected jest brings laughter.

Of course, Baek Janghoon has no reason to refuse An Joonghyeon. Isn’t he a renowned actor who can handle diverse roles? The title of national actor isn’t given lightly.

But both of them already have faces marked by the passage of time.

"Hey, if we did that, we’d have to rewrite the entire script. Do you even know how old you are?"

"Hey, don’t be like that. I’m still lively."

"Lively, my foot."

"But if there’s no suitable actor to meet."

At that moment, An Joonghyeon leans forward and asks,

"Are you planning to hold auditions?"

* * *

Is this what it feels like to be betrayed by a trusted ax?

No.

Public and private matters should be clear. I was arrogant. Is there any guarantee that a batter who hit consecutive home runs will hit another?

The projects I’ve worked on for years have been successful, and the media praised me, making me unconsciously feel like I was flying.

No matter what, in the past, I was an unknown actor wandering through minor roles.

Back then, I worked so hard to get even a small role. I would’ve clung to the director’s pants if it meant getting a minor role.

"Youngguk, is this true?"

Representative Kim Seonghwan walks in, holding a newspaper open.

[Director Baek Janghoon's Next Project Actor Rumors Stir Up Chungmuro―!]

Just like the saying, “The birds hear the words of the day and the rats hear the words of the night,” it seems the news has already spread thanks to the quick-footed reporters.

It’s no wonder, given that the grandpa postponed his planned sabbatical to push forward with pre-production for Baek Janghoon's next project.

"Representative, I think it’s time to stop hesitating."

"What? Are you saying you’ve been contacted for Director Baek Janghoon's project!?"

"No, I wish, but."

I explained the recent events with grandpa, starting from meeting writer Go Kwangtae to Director Baek Janghoon reviewing the script.

When I finally mentioned that Director Baek was considering me as a potential lead actor, Representative Kim Seonghwan sighed.

"Actually, this is good."

"……?"

"I’ve been walking a path that seemed too dreamlike. It wasn't that I acted well but rather that I used my experiences well. Now I think I know what to pursue as a real actor. That’s why I said it’s time to stop hesitating."

"I don’t quite understand, Youngguk. Everyone in Korea knows you’re a good actor."

Representative Kim Seonghwan doesn’t know my past life.

‘If it weren’t for those experiences back then.’

I would have been just an actor wandering through minor roles.

"I want to make an effort."

"Youngguk, you’re already putting in effort, right? No one else your age studies scripts until they’re worn out like you."

"I want to return to my original intention. To that time when I was crazy about acting."

Doubt fills Representative Kim Seonghwan’s face. No wonder, he couldn’t understand what I meant.

A faint talent, like a firefly. I made every effort to nurture that talent.

But the reason I tried so hard, even being called crazy about acting, was to break the cycle of poverty.

Even though the experiences from that time laid the foundation for who I am today.

Grandpa’s firm words woke me up. It felt like I had finally landed after flying in the sky.

I want to be crazy about acting again. Not to break the cycle of poverty like in the past.

I want to be crazy about acting itself.

"Good job, everyone!"

There’s no sign of energy on the set that just finished shooting all night. Shooting without sleep and working with last-minute scripts left everyone, from the staff to the actors, with dark circles under their eyes.

But amidst it all, one actor moves around the set, bowing and smiling brightly to everyone, regardless of rank.

"Hwawon, aren’t you tired? The waiting time was long, and you must’ve been exhausted from shooting all night with last-minute scripts."

His manager asks as Son Hwawon finishes greeting everyone on the drama set.

Son Hwawon responds with a faint smile, and the manager swallows his admiration. No wonder, having such a polite actor under his care felt like a blessing.

As Son Hwawon gets into the van, he asks the manager,

"Hyung, is that true?"

"What?"

"The rumor about Director Baek Janghoon's next project casting actors."

Learning about the news while filming the drama kept him from feeling tired all night.

"It’s already widely spread in Chungmuro. Since Baek Janghoon’s team personally got involved, a lot of actors must be eager to apply."

At that moment, a man who had given him honest advice crosses Son Hwawon’s mind.

-Just as a caterpillar breaks free and becomes a butterfly, acting is the same. Don’t get too caught up in the limits you set for yourself. From what I see, Hwawon, you’re worth more than the limits you set. One day, you’ll break through that shell.

Even while filming the drama, that person’s advice kept lingering in his mind.

He heard that actor Jang Youngguk and Director Baek Janghoon lived together for a long time, like a grandfather and grandson.

"Hyung, is actor Jang Youngguk also going to be in that project?"

"There’s no such word. They just said all the roles are still unconfirmed. That’s why so many agency representatives are trying to show their faces at Baek Janghoon’s production these days, hoping their actors get noticed. It’s all pointless, though."

The manager clicks his tongue and adds.

"But it’s not that easy. Baek Janghoon is known for being strict. No matter how much money you throw at him, if your acting isn’t good, you can’t even set foot on the set."

Director Baek Janghoon’s casting choices have been a topic in Chungmuro for a long time. No matter how famous the actor, if they didn’t fit his vision, they couldn’t even get a minor role.

Not even money could solve it. There’s a famous story about an investor offering to finance his film entirely, but Baek Janghoon firmly stated that no interference in the shooting was allowed.

It was something only a master could do. How many directors in Korea can create their work without being bound by money?

Moreover, each of his works was recognized for both commercial success and artistry. No wonder he’s called a living legend in the film industry.

As a result, all actors in Chungmuro aspire to appear in Baek Janghoon’s films. It was an honor to appear in a master’s film.

"They say the script isn’t even fully out yet, but people are already so eager. It’s impressive."

The manager’s words echo inside the vehicle. The reflection of Son Hwawon in the window is filled with determination instead of fatigue.

Of course. He, too, was an actor in Chungmuro who longed to appear in Director Baek Janghoon’s film.

* * *

Sillim-dong has a unique scent. Not just the old textbook smell from second-hand bookstores but the cigarette smoke from the sighs of civil service exam failures, carrying the joys and sorrows of life.

It lingers in the air like the pine scent from an ancient pine tree deeply rooted in the community.

"Phew."

Though I pride myself on my fitness, the steep hill is still tough. Occasionally, there are banners fluttering on the villas in the exam village, announcing the success of examinees.

It feels like these places are proclaiming their excellence. But even that disappears as one climbs the steep hill. Like the air that gets thinner at higher altitudes, the success of passing the exam also seems to fade.

"Is it here?"

It reminds me of the old boarding houses in Namhang. The metal gate is so old and misaligned that it seems doubtful if anyone lives here.

Surely, many exam takers live here. But they are indifferent to the visit of an outsider. Like monks who have severed ties with the world.

"Writer Go―!"

When there’s no answer for a long time after calling out at the gate, I reluctantly step inside.

A man, awkwardly walking out of a broken bathroom door, appears. He is Go Kwangtae, the writer living among the exam failures like an outcast.

"Actor Jang?"

Go Kwangtae, holding a roll of toilet paper in one hand, looks at me with wide eyes. He must not have expected me to show up here.

The wallpaper, once yellow, is now moldy.

The ceiling fan, half broken, looks like a scene from a horror movie.

There’s a military blanket on the floor, and soju bottles are scattered around, indicating someone lives here. Go Kwangtae, embarrassed, rubs his nose.

"You need to drink occasionally while writing. It gets lonely. Writing a script with no end in sight, no one appreciates it. But don’t get me wrong; I only drink one bottle every two days."

"……."

"Well, it’s because I’m broke."

Then I remember. In the past, Director Go Kwangtae was known in the film industry as a notorious drunkard.

He scratches his head awkwardly and says,

"I’m late in saying thanks. I was planning to visit Korea University with Dongjin next week. If it weren’t for you, how could Director Baek Janghoon personally take on my film? I still can’t believe it. It feels like a dream. Thank you so much."

At that moment, Go Kwangtae grabs my hands. I clearly saw him scratching his butt as he came out of the bathroom.

"But what brings you here? How did you find my address?"

"I asked Senior Dongjin. I really wanted to meet you, writer."

"Me?"

For a screenwriter, a script is like their child. Who knows a child better than their parent? They’ve carried it in their heart for a long time, like pregnancy and childbirth.

"I want to be in your work."

"Hmm, wouldn’t it be better to see Director Baek Janghoon for that? I only wrote the script; I’m completely ignorant about film directing."

"That’s why I came. I felt like I didn’t meet Director Baek Janghoon’s expectations. No matter how many times I read the script and tried to understand it alone, I couldn’t grasp it."

Only the creator knows the details of their work.

"What do you think synchronizing a role and an actor means?"

The fusion of role and actor is hard to explain. No matter how good an actor is, they can’t perform every role.

It can be cumbersome, like wearing clothes that don’t fit, or sometimes uncomfortable due to excessive effort.

"In principle, an actor’s name value can’t be ignored in determining a film’s success. But not all films with famous actors are successful. Honestly, I’m still ignorant about films, so I don’t know if it’s right for me to say this."

"Please speak freely."

"After meeting Director Baek Janghoon, I went to a video rental store the next day and watched all the films you were in. You were the first actor to bring my script, practically my child, to life. The more I watched, the more amazed I was. You’re more famous than I thought. Watching the videos, I wondered how you could act like that at your age. But now, I think I understand why Director Baek Janghoon didn’t choose you."

After a long pause, Go Kwangtae looks up. His disheveled hair reveals bright eyes staring at me.

"The texture is different."
