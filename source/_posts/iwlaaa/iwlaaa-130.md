Giant.

The giants of Chungmuro gathered together. Seeing them occupying the seats of honor at the press conference, the reporters couldn't believe their eyes. These were people who usually refused to do interviews with the media. It was then.

"The reason we have gathered here today is because, as filmmakers, as seniors, and as adults, we have a duty to fulfill. The corruption and irregularities of entertainment agencies have been a chronic disease prevalent since the past."

Adults.

Director Baek Janghoon's solemn voice made it difficult for any reporter to easily raise their hand.

"A very young junior tried to solve this issue with their own hands. However, they almost ended their own life tragically without even fully blooming. The corruption and irregularities of the involved agency will be judged by the court, but I have something else to say today."

Director Baek Janghoon's eyes changed as he looked at the reporters.

"Despite the sudden press conference, I didn't expect so many reporters to come. Do you all know why this press conference is being held?"

"I'm not sure, but I heard it's related to actress Cha Hyejin."

"That's correct. The reporter who just spoke is Reporter Yang Seonil, right?"

"Yes... that's correct."

Reporter Yang Seonil, who never imagined that a giant of Chungmuro would know his name, started sweating nervously as he met Director Baek Janghoon's gaze.

"The reporter who first published the exclusive on actress Cha Hyejin's past."

"T-that was something I had to do as a reporter. Due to the nature of my job, I had to inform the public as soon as possible..."

"That's nonsense!"

"..."

"Do you know how many people were harmed by your words! This isn't just about Reporter Yang Seonil. While there may be reporters here who aren't like that, the majority focused on the past of an unrelated actress instead of the corruption of the entertainment agency."

Director Baek Janghoon, who usually had the impression of a kind grandfather.

"I want to ask the reporters. How many more have to die for this gossip to end?"

"..."

"The essence of this case lies in the corruption and irregularities of the entertainment agency. But you all forgot your duty as reporters and just looked for sensational news. I want to ask you one thing today."

But his eyes gleamed like a tiger's in an instant.

"Are you reporters? Or are you..."

The firmness felt from his presence with the microphone could be felt penetrating through the TV screen.

"Street thugs!"

* * *

CEO Kim Seonghwan clenched his fists. Manager Lee Bongchun, who was watching the press conference on TV, felt the same.

"Oh, I feel so relieved!"

CEO Kim Seonghwan exhaled the breath he had been holding and spoke cheerfully. His face was flushed. He was so absorbed in watching the live broadcast of the press conference that excitement filled him to the brim.

"Youngguk, Director Baek Janghoon is truly amazing. He deserves to be called the godfather of Chungmuro. That's what a real adult is like."

An adult.

It's not wrong. Although there were many prominent figures in Chungmuro and the broadcasting world, no one else could hold a press conference like this.

Moreover, who in Korea could criticize reporters so harshly at a press conference?

'Grandfather.'

Even the hyena-like reporters couldn't easily open their mouths at Grandfather's stern voice. Grandfather appeared more dignified than ever in the video. His imposing presence looked larger than life, and his sharp eyes seemed ready to devour the reporters.

His rebuke wasn't just directed at the reporters. It was a cry to the public watching the press conference beyond the TV screen.

At that moment.

-It's inappropriate for Director Baek Janghoon to call us street thugs. Reporters are professionals who seek the truth. Reporting on Cha Hyejin's past is also a right we have as journalists.

It was the reporter who had just been scolded by Grandfather. He asked a question with a twitching cheek, possibly thinking he was humiliated at the live press conference. His face was also flushed, as if it would explode any moment.

At that moment, another voice was heard.

-What right! Saying the public has the right to know about Cha Hyejin's past! How dare you speak so carelessly just because you have a mouth?

-Actor Ahn Junghyun, that's too harsh!

-What's harsh is what you did! Even a three-year-old knows what's wrong, but you all ignored it because of your petty pride and money! If digging into the unrelated victim's weaknesses is your right as a journalist, how are you different from hyenas! This is disgusting!

It was Uncle. He was so angry that his usual playful demeanor was nowhere to be found.

If another director from Chungmuro sitting next to him hadn't stopped him, he might have started cursing.

At that moment, Grandfather took the microphone to calm the excited Uncle. Grandfather's gaze at the reporter was exceptionally sharp.

-Reporter, if you still haven't come to your senses...

-...

-You should be ashamed.

* * *

Sitting on the hospital bed, watching the clouds drift by endlessly. Just as human lives are diverse, the shapes of clouds are also varied.

But why am I so pathetic? I decided to break the vicious cycle, but I couldn't even handle my own past.

I was brave, but I deeply regretted it.

'Phew.'

Cha Hyejin brushed her face with her long fingers.

The career she had built as an actress turned to bubbles in an instant, and the media was digging into her past like fleas.

It's not the financial loss, like the penalty for breaching advertising contracts, that makes her regretful. It's people's gazes.

Hostess.

Every gaze from passersby felt like they were digging into her past, making her whole body shrink.

Colleagues who used to call her unnie and dongsaeng have stopped answering her calls, and no one visits her anymore.

Everyone left. In the crushing loneliness, she decided to commit suicide, but even that didn't work out.

As if even a hesitant person like her doesn't deserve the chance to die.

"Should I jump?"

Would jumping out the window end this pain? Would it put a full stop to this vicious cycle?

When such a bad thought entangled her mind.

"Jump? What are you talking about, Cha Hyejin!"

"Huh?"

"I knew this would happen. Anyone who looks at you would think you're a tragic heroine! Good grief!"

It was the stylist.

"Why are you...?"

Wasn't she the one who used to harass her with harsh words on set?

She never imagined the stylist would show up in the hospital room even the manager didn't visit. Tidying up the messy room, the stylist spoke.

"Is there a place I can't come to? I'm unemployed now too! I got fired because unnie suddenly got fired. I didn't want to come, but I had a feeling, and what? Jump out the window? Did you think I would ignore you?"

"I was really mean to you on set."

"Actors can be mean to stylists if they're not happy. I'm relieved I don't have to serve you anymore. Are you getting hysterical because I'm suddenly speaking informally?"

"..."

"Unnie might not remember, but I once asked for an advance on my salary. The CEO refused, but you pushed for it, and I barely managed to pay my mom's hospital bills. That's why I came. So cheer up! Cha Hyejin!"

The stylist's scolding finally cleared Cha Hyejin's mind.

Then the stylist turned on the TV. A press conference was ongoing.

"Look, it's a press conference related to you."

"A press conference...?"

Cha Hyejin's voice trembled. The thought of a press conference filled her with dread. But the stylist held her dry hand warmly, giving her the courage to watch the TV.

-You are insulting a person's dignity. So stop distorting the essence of the case and fulfill your duty as a reporter!

And hearing the voices of adults comforting her on the TV screen, Cha Hyejin couldn't help but burst into tears. The stylist hurriedly handed her a handkerchief.

"I thought you were always so sharp on set that you didn't know how to cry..."

She thought everyone had turned their backs on her. But that wasn't true. A gentle voice whispered in her ear.

"Unnie, don't give up!"

* * *

After the press conference.

"Oh, hyung. If you hadn't stopped me, I would have given that reporter a real scolding!"

In Grandfather's mansion, Uncle and the giants of Chungmuro who attended today's press conference gathered.

Uncle gulped down soju and continued.

"Did you see his face when you told him to be ashamed at the end? His face turned red as if he had eaten a whole train! Does being a reporter make him special? He was a snot-nosed kid when we were making movies in Chungmuro."

"Junghyun, I understand your feelings. I wanted to punch him too."

"Right, Hyung Jeong and Hyung Kim! If it were a recorded broadcast instead of a live one, I would have grabbed the reporter by the collar. Acting like a big shot with his press badge, how is he different from a Japanese policeman during the colonial era!"

Youngguk sat alone in the main hall. At that moment, Grandfather, dressed in hemp clothes, quietly sat beside him.

"Did you come out because Junghyun was being noisy?"

"No. It's been a while since I saw Uncle get so angry. He's always so playful, I didn't expect him to get so mad at the press conference. But it was cool."

"You rascal, what about your Grandfather?"

"Grandfather was, of course, cool too."

It was true. Even with his life experiences, it was something he couldn't do himself.

Like Grandfather said, it's time for adults to step up. Only an adult could do that.

"Weren't you scared, Grandfather?"

"When I was young, I was afraid of public opinion. I often refused help for fear that my hard-earned efforts would be in vain. I was heartless and cowardly. But as I got older, I realized it was all meaningless."

"..."

"I hope you don't feel the regrets I did when I was young, Youngguk."

Grandfather held his hand. The warmth felt between his wrinkled palms was a reflection of his past.

With bright eyes, Grandfather spoke softly.

"What's important is how you use your power when you have it. So, Youngguk, when you have power in the future, use it wisely."

It was an experience he hadn't gained in his past life. As someone who had only focused on his life as an actor, a new light was shining on his life.

The sky, once filled with dark clouds, had cleared, and the full moon shone brightly.

Under the moonlight, the jars on the terrace shone more brightly than ever.
