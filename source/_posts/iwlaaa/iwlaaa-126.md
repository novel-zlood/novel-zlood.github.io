The entertainment industry is often referred to as a "den of corruption."

This means that its corruption is as severe as in politics, and the darkness hidden behind its glamour is immeasurably deep.

When one walks the path intoxicated with vanity, they eventually realize that they are bound by an unbreakable chain.

"Did someone catch a weakness of hers?"

Youngguk could intuitively sense it from Cha Hyejin’s trembling pupils. Of course, an actress wouldn't act like this unless someone had something on her.

In his past life, he had seen countless actresses like her. However, most of their fates were not good. They would suffer from the unbreakable chains and eventually be choked by their past.

“What are you so worried about?”

He doesn’t beat around the bush.

“There are only two ways.”

He simply speaks his mind.

“Keep being dragged around like that.”

“······.”

“Or crash into it.”

Cha Hyejin collapses into her seat as she watches Youngguk’s retreating figure. Her manager, seeing her collapse, rushes over in a panic.

With that, the advice is over. The choice is hers to make.

The wrap-up party that started in the convention hall moved to a barbecue restaurant. Thanks to the cash gift given by the broadcasting station president, everyone is at the peak of excitement, and the energy isn’t dying down easily.

Having shed his minor status, Youngguk also raises a glass of soju.

‘This is the taste.’

The sweet and bitter sensation travels from his tongue down his throat. Writer Choi Eunsook looks at Youngguk with wide eyes.

“Youngguk, you can drink quite well? Have you been secretly drinking since your student days?”

“Writer Choi, you didn’t know? Our Youngguk drinks well. As someone who shared a drink with him as soon as he became an adult, I can vouch for it. I’m not the type to lose to anyone when it comes to drinking, but I couldn’t beat this kid. Turns out, Youngguk is a natural drinker!”

“When did the director come? Stop drinking so much. You’ll end up with a hangover like actress Cha.”

“Hey! If not today, when can we drink like this? Let’s drink till we drop today! Youngguk, are you ready?”

Director Kim Deukhyeong moves around the barbecue restaurant, boosting the atmosphere. He looks like he would fit better as a tavern owner if he didn’t hold a camera.

Once Director Kim disappears, Writer Choi Eunsook shakes her head and speaks.

“Youngguk, do you have any plans for your next project? I hear there’s a lot of buzz about synopses being sent to Songwon these days?”

“Oh, come on. How can I think about that when the last project just ended? Are you planning to start writing your next one immediately, Writer Choi?”

“My imagination well has run dry, and I can’t draw out any more ideas. But if you, Youngguk, say you’ll join my next project, I’ll manage to come up with something. Let’s work together again when the time is right, okay?”

“It would be an honor for me.”

It’s something he couldn’t have imagined in the past. Many actors in his previous life were dying to make even a brief appearance in Writer Choi Eunsook’s works.

Some famous actors even followed her schedule, begging to be cast.

Just then, a renowned PD approaches with a soju glass in hand.

“What are our lead actor and Writer Wang chatting about? Are you two planning something without me?”

“Hoho. I just prefer the side that provides more production funding.”

“Look at this, Writer Choi. Between us? That’s disappointing. We’ve been through thick and thin together.”

“Oh my, why are you talking like that? Is there something that could ruin someone’s marriage?”

“What are you imagining? I meant we debuted together. When a snotty PD and writer collaborate on their first project, they go through everything together. Don’t you remember? You were so frustrated about not being able to write that I ran to the food stall at dawn.”

“When was that!”

The barbecue restaurant becomes noisy again. Youngguk watches them with a smile. This kind of environment, filled with the scent of people, is what he had always longed for.

The cinematographer rhythmically taps a spoon on a soju bottle, humming a tune. The PD and writer, reminiscing and bickering, make Youngguk smile warmly. Just then, an actor sits across from him.

“Ahem, Youngguk. Shall we have a drink?”

It’s theater actor Park Sangcheol. There had been a quarrel between them in the past, but they had been getting along without any trouble lately.

Youngguk nods happily and pours soju into his glass. The rich scent of humanity wafts from the rippling soju in the glass.

* * *

Dried fish, mouths agape as if in chorus, are maturing in the sea breeze, while the live fish in the constantly filling red basin thrash their tails, adding vitality.

Grandmothers in traditional pants gather in small groups, selling spring greens they picked from the mountains.

There’s so much that it’s hard to carry with both hands, but a few ten-thousand-won bills are enough to cover their day’s wages.

“Handsome young man, I’ll give you more. Just wait a moment.”

Though her face is hidden under a hat, the vendor grandmother seems grateful to the young man who bought all her greens, continuously stuffing them into a black plastic bag.

At that moment, a small child sitting next to the vendor grandmother stares intently at the young man.

“Is she your granddaughter?”

“No, he’s a boy. He just has a pretty face. He’s usually shy and hides behind my skirt when customers come, but why is he acting differently today? Jeongsu, do you like this oppa?”

“He’s the oppa from TV.”

“TV? What are you talking about?”

‘Ah, television.’

Youngguk smiles slightly and raises his hat to the child. The child’s eyes widen like saucers.

Youngguk puts his index finger to his lips, signaling the child to stay quiet. Just as he starts to enjoy the warmth of the market, it bustles again with the footsteps of tourists.

‘Wow, this is a lot.’

With bags full of spring greens in both hands, Youngguk walks. He hadn’t intended to buy so much. The sight of the grandmother and her grandson at the stall reminded him of his own past.

Moreover, if a few ten-thousand-won bills could make their evening plentiful, what better good deed could there be? Plus, his mother loves these greens.

“Huh?”

When he reaches his mother’s shop, he can’t hide his puzzlement.

It’s been years since they opened the shop, and there were many places that needed fixing. The sign’s paint was faded, and the tent at the entrance had some worn-out spots.

But the shop he hadn’t visited in a while looked brand new and clean.

‘Did my mother do this?’

Did she hire someone? Youngguk walks in and opens the shop door. Then he realizes who had cleaned up the shop.

“Oh, I’m sorry, but we’re out of fish for the evening.”

“Ms. Myeongjin, who is it?”

“A customer. I’ll be right back, so don’t touch anything. You might get hurt.”

Youngguk can’t hide his surprise at the sudden appearance of a soot-covered man. But the voice from the back of the shop is undoubtedly his mother’s.

At that moment, a girl of middle school age rushes out from the back.

“Dad, hurry! The faucet is leaking, and the shop will flood!”

“Oh no! This is bad. Jisoo, tell the customer again.”

“Okay! Hurry! The shop will flood!”

The soot-covered man hurries to the back of the shop. The girl stands in front of Youngguk.

“Oppa, you should have come earlier. We sold out all the fish from the auction in the morning. Did you hear about it and come here? This shop is famous for having big, fresh fish!”

She speaks to the customer with a relaxed smile, indicating she’s used to filling in.

“But we’re out of fish, so there’s not much to sell. Want me to recommend a good shop? There’s another stall next door!”

“Yang’s shop?”

“Oh, how do you know that, oppa!”

She calls him oppa without hesitation, even though it’s their first meeting. Youngguk removes his hat with an indescribable smile. The girl, Jisoo, finally widens her eyes.

* * *

Like a spring girl, there’s an inexplicable shyness on his mother’s face. The soot-covered man also looks the same.

In the midst of the chaotic atmosphere, only the girl, Jisoo, watches with wide eyes. Unable to bear it, Youngguk smiles and speaks first.

“Hello, I’m Jang Youngguk.”

“Oh, my mind’s all over the place. I’m Kim Myeongjin, running a side dish shop at Namhang Market. I’ve heard a lot about you from your mother. This is my daughter, Jisoo.”

“So, you’re Jisoo?”

“Huh? Oppa, you know me?”

“Of course. Whenever I talk to my mother, she always talks about a young friend who keeps her company.”

Seeing the black bag, his mother asks.

“Guk, what’s all that? And why didn’t you call?”

“The shoot’s over, and I have a day off from school tomorrow, so I came to watch the last episode of the drama with you. I bought these greens for you to use in your cooking.”

“You bought so much wild greens. This could feed everyone in Namhang.”

“We can share them with Mr. Kim and Ms. Yang next door. By the way, aren’t you going to make dinner for your son who just came back?”

“Oh my, I forgot.”

“I’m kidding. It’s late, so let’s order some fried chicken. Mr. Kim and Jisoo, would you like to stay for dinner?”

Mr. Kim looks surprised and can’t speak, but Jisoo nods enthusiastically.

“Oppa! Can I watch the drama with you? I was going to watch it at home, but dad always makes me go to bed early, saying I won’t grow tall.”

Her awkward dialect shows she’s from Seoul. Watching her smile shyly, Youngguk finds her cute.

He looks at Mr. Kim, who reluctantly nods. Jisoo cheers.

“And can we take a picture? I want to show off to my friends at school tomorrow!”

“Kim Jisoo!”

“Dad, why!”

“It’s okay. Taking a picture is no big deal. How about I pick you up from school tomorrow? I’ll be heading back to Seoul in the evening.”

“Really!?”

“Oh, Youngguk. You don’t have to.”

“Please, speak comfortably. You’re around my mother’s age, and it’s awkward for me if you keep being formal.”

Mr. Kim scratches his head awkwardly. They sit around a small TV in the shop, eating dinner together.

His mother’s face, which had been shy, returns to its usual expression. It would be a lie to say he isn’t a bit jealous when she takes care of Mr. Kim, but didn’t he say he’d do anything for his mother’s happiness?

‘Is this why mother didn’t want to move to Seoul?’

He thought she didn’t want to leave because of her attachment to Namhang Market, but there was more to it.

Though it’s just fried chicken for dinner, it feels like a feast.

“I’m going to take a walk by the dock before the drama starts.”

He walks along the dock to clear his head. The streetlights cast shadows, causing the cats eating fish to scatter. Youngguk laughs, telling them to be careful not to get hurt.

‘Father, please don’t be too hard on mother.’

The rippling waves seem to respond to his inner thoughts.
