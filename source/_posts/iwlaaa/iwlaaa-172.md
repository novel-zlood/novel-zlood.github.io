The filming of a work goes through the processes known as pre-production, such as synopsis, planning, script, storyboard, staff composition, and location scouting, before entering the production stage.

The actual filming period is something that no one can predict. It is not uncommon for filming to be canceled even after the cast has been confirmed. However...

The current MBS drama department was different. Who would indeed kick away a fortune that has come rolling in?

Kim Woo-hyung's debut work, which had been stuck in the planning stage, gained rapid momentum due to the casting of two outstanding young actors, Jang Youngguk and Yeonsu.

Youngguk's choice of his next project caused a huge sensation, not only in the broadcasting industry but also in Chungmuro.

Most stakeholders thought Youngguk would head to Hollywood right after finishing filming in Hong Kong.

That was because Hollywood had been sending love calls exclusively to Youngguk among Korean actors for several years, so his future moves were highly anticipated.

“Hello, actor Jang Youngguk!”

The reporter's voice was full of excitement. No wonder, as it was an interview with the hottest actor in Korea at the moment.

Considering that many media outlets and broadcasters had sent interview requests but received no response, this was a golden opportunity.

“It’s been quite a while since your last interview; would you like to say a word to our viewers?”

Youngguk gave a deep bow towards the camera with a faint smile.

“Nice to meet you. I’m actor Jang Youngguk. I would like to thank all the fans and viewers who have been waiting for me for so long. I will be meeting you through a new drama on MBS Broadcasting Station, so please watch it passionately!”

After the formal greeting, the reporter started the main interview.

“It’s said that the work you’ve taken on this time has some fantasy elements. Is that true?”

“It is true. The story itself deals with a merman prince living in the sea who transforms into a human and experiences events on land. It's like a mythical tale that can't happen in real life.”

“I see, thank you for the introduction. Now, we have some news that we obtained separately, and we’d like to confirm if it's true.”

“Confirmation?”

“I heard that you actively recommended Yeonsu for the role opposite you. If it’s a sensitive topic, we can edit this part out…”

The reporter's voice trailed off, worried that it might be a question that would offend Youngguk. However, Youngguk smiled again and answered without a care.

“Why make it off-the-record like it’s some secret? It's true that I recommended actress Yeonsu for the role. But that doesn’t mean she was cast unconditionally; an audition was held, and the final decision was made by the producer and writer.”

“It’s true then! Could you tell us why you recommended actress Yeonsu for the role?”

“Because she’s beautiful.”

“Pardon?”

The unexpected answer left the reporter flustered. But Youngguk continued with a playful smile.

“You’ll know when the drama airs, but in the story, the merman prince falls in love at first sight with the female lead. She has to be that beautiful. In that sense, Yeonsu fits the role perfectly. Of course, she is also an actress with solid acting skills built up since her child actor days.”

It was a humorous answer. The questions related to the drama continued, including why Youngguk chose a drama over a film for his next project.

People were very curious about why he chose to appear in a domestic drama, even adjusting his appearance fee, despite receiving numerous love calls from both Chungmuro and overseas.

“Because I liked the script. And I thought I could return to my roots and refocus by filming again in Yeongdo after a long time.”

However, three days later, what filled the headlines was not Youngguk’s values and mindset.

One month later.

The blue sea was surging. On the coast near Namhang, the staff was bustling around, preparing for filming. Seagulls circled in the air, curious about what was happening.

Director Kim Woo-hyung was shouting with veins bulging from his neck.

“Senior! We’re going to shoot from above, but if we set up like this, it’ll come out dim because of the backlight. Please move it slightly to the left!”

“Director Kim, I know it looks better that way and it's more convenient. But what if a wave suddenly hits? If the equipment gets wet with seawater, it can’t be repaired.”

“I understand how you feel! But it’s the first shot. Let’s be a bit bold. I’ll take responsibility if anything breaks, so don’t worry and move it about 2 meters towards the shore!”

“Director Kim, you said you’d take responsibility. No going back on your word?”

Seeing Kim Woo-hyung’s resolute nod, the cinematographer reluctantly ordered the staff to move the equipment again.

Kim Woo-hyung finally took a breather after confirming the equipment was moved. That’s when Youngguk approached him.

“Director, is everything going well?”

Youngguk was now speaking informally. During the script reading, Kim Woo-hyung, who was older, had kept using formal language, so Youngguk had insisted he wouldn’t film unless Kim Woo-hyung spoke informally. It was intentional.

If a barrier formed between the director and actors on set, it could disrupt the filming atmosphere.

“Did you see?”

“Of course. It was so loud I thought there was a fight or something.”

“It’s a common occurrence.”

Kim Woo-hyung smiled bitterly. He had just started wearing the director's badge. And this was his first project; it was like a new lieutenant leading seasoned sergeants into battle.

“Director Park isn’t usually this strict. I heard he had some bad experiences in the past. You know how senior staff run away when accidents happen on set. Plus, it’s my debut project and my first time being in charge, so it's natural to be worried.”

What a nice person.

Youngguk thought it was more of a power struggle, but Kim Woo-hyung might not realize it since it was his first time in charge. There were certainly power struggles on set. They didn’t only happen between directors and actors.

When a new producer is in charge, power struggles often occur with the directors of each department.

Of course, these power struggles naturally resolve over time. Either the producer gains control, or they lose it.

“By the way, isn’t writer Min going to watch the first shoot?”

Youngguk intentionally brought up Min Sujin, the writer, to change the subject. During the script reading, she had said she would definitely attend the first shoot, but she was nowhere to be seen on set.

“She said she was too nervous to come.”

“Writer Min?”

“Yes, the media has been showing a lot of interest. She seemed to be holed up at home writing the script, not coming out at all. She probably didn’t expect this much attention for her debut project.”

Hmm.

Youngguk felt somewhat apologetic. He hadn’t intended to burden writer Min. But as the news of his next project got closer to the crank-in, the media coverage heated up. There weren’t only good articles, so she must have felt a lot of pressure.

“Aren’t you nervous, Director?”

“Not at all. I actually see this as the greatest opportunity of my life. The production budget was allocated much more than expected. I didn’t expect to receive so much anticipation for my debut project. But I have to show something spectacular. How can I just be nervous when I have a great actor like you in front of me?”

He spoke eloquently. But why was his lower eyelid twitching?

At that moment.

“Oh, Youngguk. I’m leaving first. Something came to mind that I need to organize. Take care.”

“Suddenly?”

Before Youngguk could respond, Kim Woo-hyung hurriedly left. And then.

“Oppa!”

A familiar voice called out. Turning his head quickly, he saw Yeonsu standing there. Her figure in a fluttering dress reflected the sunlight, making her look exceptionally dazzling.

“Is the shoot preparation going well?”

“That’s what I wanted to ask you. Have you memorized the script?”

“Do you still think I’m a kid? I’m known among actors for reading the script a lot, even if not as much as you.”

Yeonsu, who always seemed like a child actor, now felt like an adult actress. As if sensing his gaze, she asked with a mischievous smile.

“Why, do you still think I’m too pretty?”

Yeonsu was still teasing about the past interview. What can he do? His mouth betrayed him.

* * *

“Scene number 1, is this a human? Or a sculpture?”

The sound of the slate clapping always heightened the tension. Especially for the first shoot. It felt like you could hear the heartbeat of the surrounding staff, it was so intense.

Kim Woo-hyung calmed his trembling heart and looked into the camera screen.

The vast expanse of the blue sea was captured on camera. Silver fish jumping out of the water looked like jewels appearing and disappearing, creating an illusion.

Amid the crashing waves, a man appeared.

He was lying unconscious. Wearing only black pants, the man was shirtless.

As the waves splashed, the man’s body got wet, and the brilliant sunlight warmly embraced his back muscles.

It was a deserted beach, with no passersby. Only seagulls were hovering, curious about the man.

“Uh?”

At that moment, a woman’s unfamiliar voice was heard. A woman passing by the beach had discovered the man washed ashore.

The woman in a fluttering dress ran towards the unconscious man.

“Are you okay? Excuse me!”

The woman tried to wake the man, but he showed no sign of movement. He was lying face down on the sand, making her worry that he might suffocate from the sand.

With all her might, the woman turned the water-soaked man over. Then.

“Wow.”

She let out an unintended exclamation. She hadn’t been able to see the man’s face properly when he was lying face down. But now that he was turned over, his face was clearly visible. His features, reflected in the sunlight, were like.

“Is this a human? Or a sculpture?”
