“What a predicament.”

The famous PD (Producer) sighed as he read the morning newspaper.

Wasn't there a saying about the calm before the storm? Neither on set nor at the wrap party did he see any signs of this coming.

He knew BS Entertainment had a bad reputation, but he never imagined actress Cha Hyejin would blow it up herself.

“Sunbae—!”

Just then, AD (Assistant Director) Kim Youngmin rushed into the drama department, also clutching a morning newspaper.

On the front page was a large photo of actress Cha Hyejin. It was obvious what he was going to say next.

“I’ve already seen it.”

“Is this article real? It’s not just one or two incidents of sexual bribery at BS. Cha Hyejin is holding a press conference today to expose everything. Rumor has it that even someone from our side is on the list…”

“Quiet.”

When the famous PD frowned, Kim Youngmin finally shut his mouth.

Indeed, with so many people involved, there had to be at least one person from the broadcasting station. The entire broadcasting industry was in a state of mourning.

“Let’s go up to the rooftop for a coffee.”

The drama department was no exception. Those who had received any kind of bribe or favor from BS Entertainment were now biting their nails in anxiety.

When they reached the rooftop, the usual smokers were nowhere to be seen. They, too, must have realized the gravity of the situation and couldn’t even manage a sip of water.

“I heard the final episode had a 46.7% viewership rating?”

“I was informed earlier.”

“Should we be thankful for this? At least Cha Hyejin waited until the drama ended to reveal everything. But does this mean our reward vacation is canceled?”

“Ugh, you idiot. Is the reward the issue right now? My head is spinning because I’m worried about Cha Hyejin. The broadcasting industry, Chungmuro, and even the political world must be on high alert.”

She wasn’t just an ordinary actress. She was a top-tier actress, often referred to as South Korea’s most beautiful actress.

“Do you think Cha Hyejin has a plan?”

Kim Youngmin finally asked, worried about Cha Hyejin.

The famous PD looked up at the sky. The clouds seemed to know how chaotic the world was, gathering darkly. He muttered softly as he watched the ominous clouds gather.

“If she had thought about the consequences, she wouldn’t have done this.”

The drizzle turned into heavier rain, and the sound of the rain hitting the umbrella created a serene atmosphere.

But even that tranquility didn’t last long. The laughter and chatter of students coming home from school soon overpowered the sound of the rain.

“Jisoo—!”

Jisoo, who was walking home with her friend under an umbrella, widened her eyes at the sudden call of her name. She then saw the man peeking out from under a large umbrella and grinned from ear to ear.

“Oppaya!”

Their friends looked at the two with curious eyes. One of them even commented, “Isn’t Jisoo an only child?” Another added, “He looks familiar.”

“You really came to pick me up?”

“I promised yesterday, didn’t I?”

“I thought you were just kidding! If I had known, I would’ve skipped cleaning duty and come out early! Wait, just a second!”

Jisoo quickly glanced at her friends. Then, with the confidence of a victorious general, she introduced the man. Her demeanor was so cute that it drew laughter.

“This is my oppaya!”

“Oppa? But Jisoo, you said you’re an only child.”

“Why do you care so much? He’s just my oppa. You’ve probably seen him on TV. This is the famous actor Jang Youngguk oppa!”

“‘Famous actor,’ really?”

It was quite a grand title.

But to middle schoolers, it didn’t matter. They were excited to see a celebrity they had only seen on TV in person. They were so excited that their umbrellas shook, causing the raindrops to bounce back.

“Jisoo, should I buy tteokbokki for you and your friends?”

“Really?”

They headed to a snack shop near the school and bought plenty of tteokbokki and fish cakes for Jisoo and her friends. The place was known for its delicious food, but Jisoo’s friends were just picking at their food.

Jang Youngguk was about to wonder if they had no appetite when Jisoo exclaimed,

“You guys! Are you pretending because my oppaya is here?”

“Pretending? No way!”

“Oppaya, these girls usually mix their lunch in a big bowl during break time at school. They’re all pretending to be dainty because you’re here. Do you think girls who pick at their food are pretty?”

“No, I think girls who eat well are prettier.”

At his playful comment, Jisoo’s friends finally relaxed and started eating the tteokbokki and fish cakes with gusto. Since they were growing, their appetites were huge, and they even ordered extra pork cutlets from the snack shop.

The snack shop lady seemed puzzled by the young man who suddenly brought in a group of girls, but she didn’t mind. After all, Jang Youngguk had pulled his hat down low, making it hard to recognize his face. She turned on a small TV in the corner.

“We will soon broadcast actress Cha Hyejin’s press conference. Contrary to the original schedule, she is now stepping onto the podium!”

Hearing the voice from the TV, Jang Youngguk also turned his attention to it.

In the small TV screen, actress Cha Hyejin was preparing for her press conference in a calm manner.

* * *

Thump, thump.

Cha Hyejin could barely contain her wildly beating heart as she stepped onto the stage for the press conference. The numerous reporters and live cameras focused on her brought a different kind of pressure compared to being on set. She took a trembling sip of water to calm herself.

Thousands of thoughts raced through her mind before she spoke, but there was no more time to waste.

She gathered her resolve and spoke into the microphone.

“Today, I will reveal the sexual bribery scandals and lobbying activities committed by BS Entertainment’s CEO Yang Sugap, as well as the unfair contracts imposed on the company’s artists.”

As soon as Cha Hyejin began speaking, reporters eagerly raised their hands. One of them got the chance to ask a question.

“Actress Cha Hyejin, you mentioned that CEO Yang Sugap of BS Entertainment has committed numerous crimes. Do you have any concrete evidence?”

Evidence.

“If I didn’t have solid evidence, I wouldn’t have even considered holding this press conference. However, I won’t be revealing the recordings and documents that could be used in court here. The most undeniable crime committed by CEO Yang Sugap is the sexual bribery.”

“What do you mean by undeniable? What does that mean?”

“I am the evidence. I, too, was present at the sexual bribery events orchestrated by CEO Yang Sugap.”

Click, click, click—

It was a major scoop. The reporters’ fingers were clicking the camera shutters faster than ever.

A top-tier actress in South Korea had just revealed her involvement in a sexual bribery scandal. It was a scandal big enough to shake the entire nation.

“CEO Yang Sugap not only engaged in sexual bribery but also imposed unfair contracts on the company’s artists. For example, he forced me to extend my exclusive contract under duress and repeatedly withheld my payments and appearance fees. He even demanded that actresses in the company sleep with influential people to gather compromising information on actors he didn’t like.”

“Gasp.”

The reporters were so shocked they forgot to take pictures, collectively gasping in disbelief.

The bad reputation of BS Entertainment was already well-known in the entertainment industry. But no one expected a top actress to expose the truth so openly.

Then, one reporter raised his hand and asked,

“Cha Hyejin, there are rumors that before you debuted, you worked as a hostess in the Gangnam area. Is that true?”

Everyone’s eyes widened in surprise. Cha Hyejin glared at the reporter.

His face was familiar. Of course, he was a journalist who frequented BS Entertainment like it was his own home.

He was clearly trying to distract from the main issue by bringing up her past.

Cha Hyejin steadied her trembling lips and firmly replied,

“Yes, it’s true.”

The sound of raindrops hitting the car window was melancholic. The van sped down the highway through the heavy rain.

Manager Lee Bongchun, usually full of jokes, was unusually serious as he drove. Jang Youngguk, sitting in the back seat, was also deep in thought, staring at the raindrops sliding down the window.

‘How unfortunate.’

Lee Bongchun couldn’t shake his grandmother’s last words from his mind. She had said that just by looking at actress Cha Hyejin’s face. It seemed those words had come true, making him feel uneasy.

Glancing at the rearview mirror, he asked,

“Youngguk, should we head straight to Director Baek’s house?”

“No, I think we need to go to the agency first.”

The bombshell dropped by actress Cha Hyejin had shaken the entire entertainment industry. The rumors of sexual bribery and various scandals had surfaced.

As a result, other agencies in the entertainment industry were also thrown into chaos.

‘The butterfly effect.’

Just as a butterfly's wings could cause a typhoon on the other side of the world, his advice seemed to have triggered this massive scandal. A scandal that hadn’t even existed in his previous life.

“CEO Yang Sugap will likely be taken into custody for investigation. I’m worried about Cha Hyejin. The media is already digging into her past.”

Although CEO Yang Sugap’s crimes were a huge scoop, reporters seemed more interested in Cha Hyejin’s past.

Articles and broadcasts about her past work at a hostess bar were already flooding the media.

Then, the phone suddenly rang.

“Youngguk, let’s stop by a rest area. I think it’s a call from the CEO.”

They pulled into a highway rest area.

After parking, Lee Bongchun answered the phone. His expression changed rapidly as he listened to the voice on the other end.

From surprise to confusion, then to despair.

After hanging up, Lee Bongchun repeatedly opened and closed his mouth while looking at the rearview mirror.

“Hyung, what’s the call about?”

Youngguk asked, prompting Lee Bongchun to wipe his dry lips before replying.

Sweat, which hadn’t been there moments ago, now covered his forehead.

“Youngguk, don’t be shocked. It’s about Cha Hyejin.”

“What about Cha Hyejin?”

“She…”

“What happened?”

At Youngguk’s urgent questioning, Lee Bongchun sighed deeply and explained.

“She attempted suicide.”
