"Your Majesty, how can a king who was destined to be a virtuous ruler commit such a heinous act? I doubt whether you are indeed the king I once knew."

This was Kim Choseon, a eunuch who served four kings from Sejo to Yeonsan.

Without a doubt, King Yeonsangun, Lee Yung, was extraordinary from birth. Kim Choseon, who had seen many royal family members, never doubted that Lee Yung would become a wise and virtuous king. He was an exceptionally intelligent crown prince.

Moreover, even after receiving the throne and during the early days of his reign, he governed for the welfare of the people.

But this king changed overnight, as if he had become a different person.

At that moment, King Yeonsan twisted his lips and began to speak.

"The three-inch tongue of a eunuch reaches the heavens, making my ears itch."

It was a statement as shocking as a thunderclap from a clear sky. The ministers watched the scene with bated breath.

However, Kim Choseon did not back down. Already old and frail, he did not hold back his final piece of advice.

"Although I am a mere eunuch, I have served four kings. You are as brilliant as the previous kings. Even when you took the throne in place of the previous king, you were not like this. What has changed you so drastically, Your Majesty? Please, do not be swayed by the infamous temptress Jang Nok-su and open your eyes to look around. Do you not see the people crying in fear and starving in poverty?"

"An infamous temptress, you say? Why do you call her that? Nok-su is merely a plaything of mine. Do you think I have become like this because of a woman's skirt?"

"Even if it costs me my tongue, I must speak. I beg you, as the father of the people, to open your eyes and set the world right. Please return to your former self and become a virtuous king once more."

The ministers trembled in fear. They knew that Kim Choseon's words were not wrong, but none dared to add to his advice.

They knew that their heads would not be safe if they did. To insult the king in front of him could bring ruin to their families. At that moment,

"Hahaha."

King Yeonsan's lips twisted slightly. His cheeks twitched.

"There is indeed a loyal servant like you among my subjects. Look at those who tremble over there. Is there anyone who steps forward like you? Even when I gathered women from all over Joseon and created the institution of Heungcheong, there was nothing to fear in a world full of traitors. Even when I broke the framework made by the previous king and committed atrocities under the name of kinship, was there anyone who tried to stop me? If I were an ordinary king, I would have been moved by your loyal advice. But Choseon, your advice is wrong from the beginning."

King Yeonsan drew a sword from the scabbard of a royal guard and pointed it at Kim Choseon's neck. The ministers closed their eyes tightly, fearing that the tip of the sword might point at their own necks.

Even in that moment of fear, Kim Choseon did not lose his intense gaze and faced Yeonsan. At that moment, Yeonsan brought his lips to Kim Choseon's ear.

"You asked me to return to my former self. But what should I do? I am not the king you knew."

At the following whisper, Kim Choseon's eyes widened.

"I am not the king."

Only then did he fully see Yeonsan's appearance. The features were the same, but the position of the spots on his face was slightly different. Why hadn't he noticed it until now?

But it was already too late. Yeonsan's sword had already cut off Kim Choseon's tongue.

Yeonsan's tyranny became more severe by the day.

Not only did he initiate the Gapja Sahwa (the literati purge of 1504), but he also had the former king's concubines, Lady Eom and Lady Jeong, killed in the backyard of Changdeok Palace by his half-brothers for the crime of participating in the dethronement of Queen Yun.

Moreover, he even executed his half-brothers who obeyed the royal command under the name of treason.

"Ban the name Kim Choseon from being used anywhere in Joseon, and make sure that anyone with the character 'Choseon' in their name changes it."

Not only did he execute Kim Choseon, who had advised him, but he also erased his name from Joseon.

Despite the death of the senior eunuch who had served many kings, the ministers did not dare to speak a word, fearing that they might become the next target.

"What is the use of the Royal Lecture? Summon the Heungcheong here to perform a dance. Today, I shall drink until my nose is crooked."

An unexpected banquet took place in the Royal Lecture Hall, where former kings studied Confucian classics with the scholars of Hongmungwan.

Women captured from all over Joseon, dressed in scandalous clothes under the name of Heungcheong, danced and played music. It was an act that shook the very foundation of Joseon.

'Ha, he who usually looks at women as if they were cows or chickens.'

Grabbing the waist of a Heungcheong dancer, he fluttered his royal robe.

The performance of the tyrant seen at the script reading was just the tip of the iceberg.

Youngguk's acting on the actual filming site left not only the famous PD but also all the staff speechless.

It was madness itself.

* * *

43.9%

As the drama entered its latter half, the viewer ratings soared day by day. Having surpassed the 40% barrier, which was thought to be unbreakable, the filming site was filled with tension, especially before the final shoot.

"Youngguk, you will attend the ending party, right?"

The famous PD asked slyly. With so much media attention these days, he was worried that Youngguk's schedule might not allow it.

"Of course, where would the lead actor not attend the ending party?"

"I was worried because you've been getting so much attention lately. By the way, are you going to France?"

"It's an invited work, so I probably won't go. Inviting a film that was released last year is already exceptional enough, so there won't be any awards. But the media is making such a fuss that I'm a bit bewildered."

Indeed, it was exceptional to invite a film that had been released almost a year ago. Expecting an award was too much.

Rumor had it that a strong advocate from the Cannes Film Festival insisted on screening "Confession of a Priest," but no one knew who it was.

"If we maintain good viewer ratings until the last episode, the director said he would push for an award at the year-end ceremony."

"It's not even summer yet, why talk about year-end awards?"

"There was a lot of talk about how you didn't receive a proper award at the SBC Acting Awards. So just keep it to yourself. Will you join the reward vacation?"

"Reward vacation?"

"We're going to Phuket. They're preparing business class flights and five-star hotels."

Even after filming the SBC drama "Youth," they had a reward vacation to Phuket. But Youngguk had skipped it due to overlapping schedules and not feeling the need to go to Phuket.

But now he was contemplating.

"Is everyone else going?"

"The head of the department approved it, so almost all the main and supporting actors will go. Most of the staff will also attend unless their schedules overlap. By the way, actor Kwak said he probably won't attend."

At that moment, AD Kim Youngmin approached.

"PD Yoo, could you come over here for a moment? We're discussing how to set up the shooting angle, and the director of photography and the lighting director are having a heated argument."

"I got it, I'm coming. Youngguk, we'll continue our conversation later."

After sending off the famous PD, Youngguk saw none other than actor Kwak Jeongwoo. Youngguk stood up and walked towards him.

"Hyung, please take care of the last shoot!"

Youngguk bowed his head and thanked Kwak Jeongwoo, the actor he had worked with the longest during the drama filming.

Though he was a rookie actor, he played the role of Gyeomsabok Jang Kwaksan and did an excellent job with the character.

"I'm the one who should be asking for your help. Honestly, I'm a bit nervous right now. I'm afraid I might make a mistake during the last shoot and ruin the scene."

"Don't worry. From what I've seen, you'll do an excellent job. By the way, are you really not going on the reward vacation?"

"Oh, I have an audition for an action movie, so I probably can't go. I'm actually torn. Just because I audition doesn't mean I'll get the role. Maybe I should go on the reward vacation and get to know the broadcasting station officials better."

"No! You must go to the audition!"

In fact, Youngguk knew Kwak Jeongwoo from his past life. Although he was a rookie actor now, he would become famous as an action star in the future.

He was convinced that if Kwak Jeongwoo auditioned for an action movie, he would likely get the role.

Kwak Jeongwoo scratched his head in confusion at Youngguk's strong discouragement.

"Okay. As an actor, auditioning is more important than going on a trip. But Youngguk, does tying up your hair like this always hurt so much?"

"Why?"

"Well, lately, every time I shower after filming, I lose a handful of hair."

Ahem.

Youngguk wondered whether he should tell him or not. In the future, Kwak Jeongwoo would be known as the Korean Jason Statham, a famous action star.

But behind that nickname was his balding head. Seeing Kwak Jeongwoo worrying about hair loss, Youngguk silently patted his shoulder.

In the place of exile where chamomile flowers bloomed, there was nothing but vast grasslands.

The sea breeze, salty and strong, blew fiercely, and a lone straw-roofed house stood in the isolated island, enduring the harsh sea wind.

There were no visitors, and the thorny branches of the mandarin orange tree surrounded it like a fence, adding to the desolation.

- As I walk the path of a tyrant, it would be strange if a rebellion did not occur. I have been waiting for it.

Lee Gyeol pretended not to know about the rebellion of the court officials. He did not bother to mobilize the royal guards to stop them. After all, he had grown tired of the life of a king.

Even as a mere tyrant, he survived because he was a king of Joseon. It was a ridiculous situation.

"It's cold, come inside quickly."

Without looking, Lee Gyeol spoke to the shadow behind the paper door. Soon, someone stepped over the crumbling threshold of the straw-roofed house. It was none other than Gyeomsabok Jang Kwaksan, who had served him all this time.

With his hat pulled deep over his face, his face was not visible, but his trembling fingertips conveyed a sense of guilt.

"Your Majesty."

"In our relationship, what is the use of calling me a king? Just call me Lee Gyeol, Gyeomsabok."

"Minister Kwaksan, on that day at Gyeolsan Valley, the former king bestowed the throne upon his younger brother. Therefore, Your Majesty will remain my lord until my last breath."

"You are as inflexible as always. What use is a title when I have been dethroned by rebellion? I am just a crumbling human being. Instead of standing there, come fishing with me. I couldn't prepare any dishes as I didn't expect any guests today."

Lee Gyeol, as usual, took a fishing rod and stepped out of the straw-roofed house. Gyeomsabok Jang Kwaksan, who was watching his back, followed with a complicated expression in his eyes.

"There's no bite today."

He tilted the fishing rod, but no fish bit. Lost in thought for a moment, Lee Gyeol smiled faintly and pulled in the fishing line.

"Gyeomsabok, do you know why I acted so recklessly?"

"......"

"I just wanted to destroy the court. If my brother and I had been born to commoners, would we have gone through such hardships? It was out of anger. Becoming a tyrant and shaking the foundation of Joseon was just revenge for my brother. It was Joseon that drove us to our deaths. If my brother saw this, he would have shed tears of sorrow."

Lee Gyeol's eyes were filled with regret and sighs. But it was already spilled water.

Lee Gyeol looked up and met Gyeomsabok's gaze. He was wearing a hat, so his expression was not visible.

"A new king has ascended, so you must also walk a difficult path. If the sword of the court does not reach you today, I can at least show my brother some face. Gyeomsabok, may I ask you one last favor?"

"Please speak."

"After I die, cut a lock of my hair and bury it next to my brother."

Lee Gyeol finished speaking and cast the fishing rod towards the sea again.

Only the quiet sea breeze lingered in the place of exile.

Gyeomsabok did not come to the place of exile without a reason. He too was on the hit list of the rebellion forces.

To survive, he had to prove his worth to the rebellion forces. Knowing this, Lee Gyeol closed his eyes quietly.

At that moment, Gyeomsabok's sword pointed towards Lee Gyeol's chest.

Perhaps because the sunlight was particularly bright, the sea water barely rippled. As Lee Gyeol's body slumped over the low cliff, Kwaksan knelt down and caught him.

The dying king's eyes seemed to say,

"I'm sorry."

The annals recorded that King Yeonsan died of sudden illness two months after being exiled. No one knew that a lock of his hair was buried with his brother.

Throwing off his hat, Kwaksan burst into tears, holding the cold, lifeless body of the king with trembling hands.

Only the chamomile flowers, swaying as if nothing had happened, seemed to be watching them.
