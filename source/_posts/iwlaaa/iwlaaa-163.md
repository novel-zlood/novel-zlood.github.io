The ambiance of the South Port always brings a sense of peace to the heart.

Watching the quiet waves singing the night sea washes away the thoughts knotted in my mind as if they were never there.

Leaving the complicated life in Seoul behind and coming down here was the right choice. At that moment, a mischievous girl's face pops up right in front of me.

"Oppaya, what are you thinking about so deeply?"

It was Jisoo. She grew up as an only child, so she doesn't know the bond between siblings. But watching Jisoo, I naturally think it wouldn't be bad to have a little sister.

"I'm thinking about what to do with the fight you had with your friend today. I heard you even had a nosebleed."

"W-when did I have a nosebleed...!"

"Your friend told me everything, that you had a big fight with a boy."

"That tattle-tale Kyungsun! And I only had a nosebleed; the guy who got hit by me has a black eye."

"Isn't he the one who ran away as soon as he saw me at the school gate today? I should have caught him and scolded him."

"No need, I can handle it myself. One punch from me is enough to knock out a loser like that! Wanna see my form? Shook-shook-shook!"

Jisoo made sounds with her mouth and threw punches in the air. At times like this, it feels like I got a younger brother instead of a sister.

But I don't dislike it. On the contrary, I find it endlessly adorable.

"Why did you fight?"

"Why, why did I fight, indeed. He was teasing me. It's nothing, so don't worry about it."

Though she seems brash, she has a deeper mind than her peers. She avoids talking about the boy who badmouthed me, perhaps worried I might get hurt.

Instead, she flares her nostrils and makes a funny smile to change the topic.

"Oppaya, the meat seems to be done. Let's go quickly!"

It's a place used as a temporary fish auction market. Facing the pier, locals would occasionally come here to grill fish or meat. It was a camping spot known only to the locals, completely unknown to tourists.

With the sea as our side dish, the lighthouse shining alone and the horizon full of fishing lights make it feel like we are eating meat in the middle of the sea.

"Youngguk, the meat is perfectly grilled! Come quickly and sit down."

Mr. Kim had his face covered in soot while grilling the meat. He did it to avoid being recognized and swarmed by people if they went to a restaurant.

Mother was smiling contently beside Mr. Kim, wiping the sweat from his forehead.

"Oppaya, here. Ah~"

Jisoo wrapped some meat in a wrap and held it out to my mouth. I didn't refuse and ate it in one bite.

Jisoo was expectantly preparing to open her mouth, but my hand reached out to Mr. Kim, who had grilled the meat.

"Mr. Kim, please have a bite too. You must not have eaten properly while grilling. Here you go."

"Oh, oh. Sure...!"

Jisoo pouted as if dissatisfied, but soon smiled as she saw her father and me smiling at each other.

After finishing the meat and cleaning up, I walked with Mr. Kim. It was time for men.

The sound of the waves crashing against the breakwater always brings a refreshing feeling. Mr. Kim and I walked in silence. After today, I was sure.

Even in Seoul, I felt it, but now I was certain that my mother was living a happy life. Compared to her past life, it was incomparable.

"Mr. Kim."

I turned my head to look at Mr. Kim while watching the rolling waves. His face still had soot marks, and he looked tense. I hugged him and added,

"Thank you."

Mr. Kim was surprised by the sudden hug but soon read my heart and patted my back.

Interview.

After resting at the South Port and returning to Seoul, the first schedule was none other than a media interview.

Of course, the agency had been holding off the press for a while. It was no longer reasonable to use the excuse of adjusting to the time difference, so I had to attend the interview.

"Actor Jang Youngguk, it's an honor to meet you!"

The reporter was excessively kind. She looked at me with sparkling eyes, similar to how one would look at an idol.

"I'm reporter Kim Seungah from Gukseon Daily."

Ah.

I remembered her, the one who always wrote favorable articles about me. Since my debut, there had been rumors that she was paid by Songwon Entertainment.

But considering the upright nature of CEO Kim Seonghwan, it was an absurd thought.

"Just a side note, I'm a huge fan of yours, Jang Youngguk. I'm thrilled to have this interview opportunity. How do you feel about being recognized globally through the Desiderio commercial, as evaluated by the broadcasting industry and Chungmuro?"

Global recognition.

"I think it's an overestimation. I haven't achieved anything significant yet, and being overly praised by those around me makes me feel rather embarrassed. I want to be evaluated by the public through my work as an actor, not just through the effect of the Desiderio commercial."

It was still too early to say. Although the Desiderio commercial and Giovanni Sponza's exhibition had indeed boosted my recognition, I had never ventured into overseas projects.

I wanted to expand my career as an actor rather than just gaining recognition through commercials.

"I understand that 'Outlaw,' directed by Baek Janghoon, which you filmed together, is in post-production and scheduled for release in the first half of next year. In Chungmuro, there's speculation that 'Outlaw' might break the record set by the adult film 'Confession of a Priest.' I'm curious about your thoughts, having participated in both films."

The measure of success for commercial films lies in the number of viewers. However, 'Confession of a Priest' was not a particularly successful film in the past, and 'Outlaw' was an unknown work that had never been released.

Even knowing the future, it was hard to predict the butterfly effect caused by me.

"Both films are undoubtedly great works. Before judging their success, I am genuinely grateful to have been able to participate in 'Confession of a Priest' and 'Outlaw' as an actor."

Kim Seungah smiled contentedly. Whether she liked my humility or was just a fervent fan, I didn't know.

"Actor Jang Youngguk, you are known for having a wide acting spectrum despite your relatively young age. Looking at your past roles, you've played various characters that are hard to find among actors of your age. Do you have any particular image in mind for your next role?"

"I don't set a specific image. Deciding on an image and then choosing a script often traps me in a certain mold, preventing good judgment. I simply become the character I choose and do my best."

It's similar to starting a novel without thinking about the genre. You decide the genre after finishing the writing. The same goes for roles. The image changes drastically depending on who plays the script.

The questions continued. How much time had passed?

"Now, for the last question."

Kim Seungah added with a look full of tension and excitement.

"Do you expect to win the Grand Prize at this year's MBS Drama Awards?"

* * *

Drama Awards, all eyes were on it.

Not only in South Port but also at Songwon Entertainment and Baek Janghoon Productions, where post-production was taking place, everyone was staring at the TV screen.

It wasn't to see the glamorous red carpet or the faces of the actors.

"Actor Park, what brings you here suddenly?"

CEO Kim Seonghwan stood up happily at the sight of actress Park Sooyoung visiting the CEO's office.

"CEO, I came because I thought you'd be worried alone. The other staff are already watching in the meeting room."

"Who's worried? No one is worried."

"Your pale face says otherwise."

Kim Seonghwan couldn't deny it any longer.

It was like a chronic illness since the drama 'Youth.' Although it had recorded an impressive viewership rating, it didn't win the grand prize.

The frustration Kim Seonghwan felt back then was immense. He didn't show it in front of Youngguk, but he had felt guilty, thinking it was all because of his lack of power.

"Enough, let's go to the meeting room and watch together. The grand prize announcement is coming up. How can you be so timid as a CEO? Aren't you going to support Youngguk?"

Listening to Park Sooyoung's advice, Kim Seonghwan felt as if cold water was poured on his head. No matter what, Youngguk was an actor who was like his own child.

He wanted to witness the history Youngguk would write with his own eyes.

Meanwhile,

"Oh, Director, you're here!"

Everyone was gathered in the common meeting room of Baek Janghoon Productions. Anyone who saw it would think it was a year-end party, with all the staff gathered late at night.

It was all to support Youngguk. Their lead actor had been nominated for the grand prize.

Director Baek Janghoon also nodded briefly and took a seat.

Director Baek Janghoon, with a kind smile like a grandfather, was staring at the TV screen.

The relationship that started at the Busan International Film Festival had continued till now.

He had met countless actors, but he had never encountered an actor like Youngguk.

Therefore, unlike others who were anxious, he was sure.

'I will watch over you.'

He was certain that this boy would leave a mark in the history of Korean actors.

At that moment,

People gathered again in the South Port Merchants Association building. As the Drama Awards progressed, everyone leaned forward, almost sucked into the TV screen.

At the center was none other than Youngguk's mother. How could she not be nervous? No matter how grown her son was, he was still her endlessly young boy.

The live broadcast camera showed the faces of the actors nominated for the grand prize. The faces of renowned actors in Korea were passing by.

Lastly, Youngguk's face appeared. Knowing his mother's heart, Youngguk in the screen also smiled.

Wearing a Desiderio suit and smiling brightly, the general public watching the awards screamed in excitement.

"Our Youngguk is the best!"

"Of course, look at that suit. It's hard to stand out among so many actors."

"This grand prize is definitely going to Youngguk. If they give it to someone else, I'll go to the broadcasting station with my fish truck tomorrow!"

Amid the bustling laughter of the South Port merchants,

'Guk-ah, Guk-ah.'

Youngguk's mother, Lee Haesook, couldn't even look straight at the upcoming grand prize announcement, only praying.

Seeing this, Kim Seonghoon held her hand. The warmth calmed Lee Haesook's trembling.

Finally, the grand prize announcement continued beyond the TV screen.
