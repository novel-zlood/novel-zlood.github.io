I went to Yeouido for the first time in a while to shoot a commercial. As with most commercials, it's an unspoken rule to refrain from them during drama shoots.

This is because leisurely shooting a commercial in the midst of a drama filled with last-minute scripts and all-nighters can make the staff uncomfortable.

However, I couldn't avoid this particular commercial. It had been planned long before I was cast in the drama. It was a shoot with Desiderio.

"Mr. Jang―!"

As I entered the studio in Yeouido, a familiar figure greeted me warmly.

"Monica?"

It was Monica Rossellini, the chief designer of Desiderio. Her appearance was unexpected. It wasn't an on-location shoot, and I didn't expect her to visit in person this time either. Before starting the commercial shoot, we enjoyed a brief tea time on one side of the studio.

Perhaps it was her dazzling silver hair, or maybe her strikingly beautiful features that mixed Eastern and Western aesthetics. The Korean staff passing by the studio kept glancing our way.

It seemed that she always had a knack for drawing attention wherever she went.

"How did you come to Korea?"

"I flew here."

"Aren't you busy preparing for the F/W season? Honestly, I never thought I would see you at the studio today."

"It's our first start in Asia. Of course, there were offers from China and Japan, but we ultimately chose Korea."

It was indeed unexpected. Desiderio originally sold exclusively in Europe. As a result, wealthy Asians often traveled to Europe to purchase Desiderio products.

That’s why it was anticipated that if Desiderio were to establish a base in Asia, it would be in China or Japan.

"Mr. Sponza occasionally talks about you, Mr. Jang. He says he wants to shoot with you again someday. But I've heard rumors that Wang Wei from China is in contact with you. Is that true?"

"Not at all. I only met him once at a film premiere in Hong Kong."

"That's a relief. By the way, is the scandal with the beautiful actress true?"

Sigh.

I sensed it from the moment she mentioned meeting Wang Wei in Hong Kong, but it was surprising how much she knew about scandals happening in Korea while being in Italy.

"It's true."

I didn't want to lie in front of Monica. It wasn't because I was close to her, but rather because I didn't want to hide my feelings for Yeonsu any longer.

Hearing my response, Monica spoke with a hint of regret.

"So it was true. That's unfortunate. I saw this visit to Korea as an opportunity... Although I failed once in Italy, I thought it wouldn't hurt to try again with a man like Mr. Jang. If she’s someone who made Mr. Jang fall for her, she must be an amazing woman, right? Do you like her a lot?"

Westerners are indeed bold when it comes to relationships. It was somewhat surprising that she asked so directly, but I continued the conversation with Monica.

"I didn't realize it before. But I found out that I like her a lot. Once I realized it, the feelings grew even stronger."

"Mr. Jang, you're unique. You're so bold when it comes to work, but so pure like a boy when it comes to love. She probably fell for this side of you."

Monica licked her lips as if regretting something and changed the topic.

"By the way, if Wang Wei comes to Korea, make up an excuse and don’t meet him."

"Why?"

"Actually, Mr. Sponza is thinking about flying to Korea immediately to tell you not to shoot with Wang Wei. That guy is a famous photographer in Asia, but he has a bad reputation. He always had scandals with the models he shot with, and very messy ones at that."

"Really? But that wouldn't concern me."

"That guy is gay."

The shooting location is like a continuous party. Especially for high-rating dramas, it's even more so. In that sense, "The Mermaid Prince" was a feast of parties.

Starting with a 23% rating for the first episode, the ratings have been continuously rising.

"Director Kim, haven't you heard from the broadcasting station lately?"

"Not at all. They keep pestering us every day. They're telling us to increase the production budget and perfect the shoot, and now they're discussing extending the show. They’re drinking kimchi soup without even having the rice cakes."

"Rice cakes?"

"Writer Min and I both want to finish it as planned since it's our debut work, and most importantly, Youngguk hates extended broadcasts."

Producer Kim Woo-hyung and the cinematographer were having a conversation while drinking soju. On the surface, it seemed like they were suffering from the broadcasting station's pressure, but deep down, it was nothing but pride.

After all, they had made a huge hit with their debut work, achieving double-digit ratings from the first episode, and now there were talks of extending the broadcast.

It was a massive success. As evidence, cash gifts for the party kept coming in every day.

"Yeonsu, are you feeling unwell?"

The art director approached Yeonsu's table with a concerned expression.

"No, I'm just a bit tired."

"If you're not feeling well, you can rest today. It’s only those carefree people who enjoy these parties; we’d rather have a coffee at a cafe and call it a day, right?"

Yeonsu gave a faint smile. The real reason for her sullen expression was simple. It was because Youngguk, who always stuck by her side on set, was absent.

Youngguk couldn't attend because of a commercial shoot.

"You're upset because Jang isn't here, right?"

Hiccup.

She hiccupped involuntarily at the art director's words, as if he had read her mind.

Yeonsu looked around, worried that others might have overheard, but everyone was already too drunk and noisy to pay attention.

"You knew?"

"Everyone probably knows, except for oblivious folks like Director Kim and the cinematographer. Everyone's just pretending not to know. And it's cute."

"What?"

"What's wrong with young men and women dating? I think it's cute and nice. Did you think we didn’t notice you two holding hands secretly on set?"

Yeonsu felt her heart sink.

"When the dating rumors first came out, I secretly hoped they were true. Both of you do so well on set and are polite and kind to other staff. I've never met actors like Youngguk and Yeonsu before. So, I hoped good people would end up together, but then the news said it was false, and I was disappointed."

"It really wasn’t true back then."

"I thought so too. Knowing Jang's personality on set, he wouldn't lie out of fear of the media. So, it was more disappointing. But then, one day, I saw you two holding hands secretly."

The art director added, speaking like a nosy aunt.

"All our staff are on your side. So, don't worry. Don't be anxious about getting caught dating on set. Who would say anything about such a lovely couple?"

Yeonsu felt touched by the sudden support. Meanwhile, the cinematographer's singing voice echoed. He seemed quite drunk.

"Oh no, he must be really drunk. I need to stop him. I can't listen to this any longer."

The art director winked and got up. She went to stop the tone-deaf cinematographer but ended up singing a duet with him. Watching this, Yeonsu felt touched once again.

* * *

"I miss you."

It was after the party ended. Yeonsu was lost in thought, looking at the sea. Of course, her manager was watching her from a parked car, so there was no problem.

At a time when few people were around, sitting under the streetlights, she couldn't help but think of the person she missed.

The seaside in summer was cool. Looking at the splashing waves, Yeonsu thought of Youngguk's face.

Since meeting Youngguk during the filming of "Man of August," he had become an indispensable part of her life.

After all, he was her first love, which they say comes only once in a lifetime.

Thump thump.

When Youngguk confessed to her, it felt so unreal that she wondered if it was a dream.

Even the next day, she wondered if it had been a dream until she went to the set.

But feeling his warmth as he secretly held her hand on set, she realized it was all real and not a dream.

"Achoo."

They say even dogs don’t catch colds in summer, but Yeonsu rubbed her nose awkwardly.

Was it because of the cool weather or the ambiance of the night sea? She had been watching the sea for a long time without realizing it. That’s when it happened.

Warmth.

Yeonsu was startled by the coat suddenly draped over her shoulders. She turned her head quickly, and a bright smile she had never shown before appeared on her lips.

"Oppa?"

Worried that she might be seeing things, she rubbed her eyes with her sleeves. That’s when Youngguk sat down next to her and spoke.

"It's cold, what are you doing here?"

"How did you come? Weren't you in Yeouido?"

"I finished the commercial shoot early and came straight down. I was going to come in the morning, but I just couldn't wait. I missed you, Yeonsu."

Under the streetlights, the two sat together. The sound of the waves and the cicadas seemed to sing a song for them.

Yeonsu's heart pounded as if it would burst at Youngguk's words. She then looked at the coat on her shoulders.

"You must be cold. Take it back."

"No, keep it on."

Youngguk shook his head at Yeonsu, who tried to return the coat. He then patted her head and added.

"If you catch a cold, who will suffer?"

"Geez, no sense of mood."

Despite saying that, Yeonsu leaned on Youngguk's shoulder. Their warmth spread, making even the night sea's breeze seem insignificant.

Yeonsu looked up at Youngguk with sparkling eyes. From his melancholic eyes to his sharp nose and plump lips, there was nothing unattractive about him.

After secretly gazing at Youngguk's face for a while, Yeonsu was startled. Youngguk had lowered his head to meet her eyes.

"Why are you staring at me like that?"

"Because I like you."

Of course, how could she not like him? She wished this moment could last forever. Youngguk lowered his head toward Yeonsu's forehead and then.

Smooch.

"I like you too."

He confessed his feelings without hiding anything.
