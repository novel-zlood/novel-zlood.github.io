Shock spreads rapidly. The eyes of the actors watching Youngguk's performance widen like saucers.

And for good reasonâ€”Youngguk's long fingers are gripping actor Kim Hyuk's chin. The scene resembles a nobleman commanding a servant.

It's hard to tell whether he's acting as a character from the script or if it's real; such is the contempt in his gaze. But then:

"You think you're something just because you carry a prosecutor's business card. In the end, you're just a disposable tool. Just a cog in the massive Hyesung Group machine. Got it?"

The following lines reveal that he is indeed acting as a character from the script.

Eventually, Youngguk's hand releases Kim Hyuk's chin.

"No matter how much you struggle, you're still beneath me, you bastard."

With his signature tongue-clicking sound, Youngguk's lips curl into a sardonic smile. He shakes his head back and forth as if contemplating whether to kill the servant before him. Just then, Director Baek Janghoon raises his hand.

After the audition.

"Kim Hyuk is truly well-grounded in the basics. I thought he'd forgotten screen techniques since he's been focused only on drama filming, but watching him today reminds me that old habits die hard. And."

The cinematographer reflects on Kim Hyuk's performance.

The audition room is now empty, with only the three judges remaining. Director Baek Janghoon stands with his arms crossed, seemingly lost in thought, while writer Go Gwangtae still can't believe famous actors performed his script.

"Youngguk was truly a surprise. I knew his range was wide from watching 'The Priest's Confession,' but I didn't expect this. And his guts! Even though Kim Hyuk provoked him first, I didn't think he'd touch Kim's chin during the audition. And that expression!"

The cinematographer exclaims in amazement.

"I never thought Youngguk could make such an expression. Though I've reviewed all his previous roles, this character is entirely different. Initially, when Youngguk auditioned for Jung Haesuk, I doubted he could pull off such an arrogant and audacious character. But today proved me wrong. He didn't just portray the character; he wore it like a well-fitted suit. What do you think, Writer Go?"

Finally, Go Gwangtae snaps out of his reverie.

"I'm still in awe that so many actors performed the roles from my script. If I had to pick the most memorable actors, it would be Kim Hyuk and Youngguk. They both brought Jung Haesuk to life."

Director Baek Janghoon's gaze remains fixed on the empty audition stage, replaying the actors' performances in his mind.

All of them delivered excellent performances with no glaring flaws.

Who will be cast as the villain in 'Outlaw'?

* * *

"Is Youngguk out of his mind?"

Actors who just finished their auditions whisper among themselves. The subject is none other than Youngguk.

No wonder, among the actors who visited Baek Janghoon Productions, Kim Hyuk was the senior-most. He was successful both in Chungmuro and on TV.

"Just because he's doing well these days, he thinks he can do whatever he wants. Even when he came into the meeting room earlier, he should have bowed at a 90-degree angle to his senior colleagues, but instead, he was chatting with that Son Hwawon."

Although it was they who didn't respond to the greeting, they seem to have forgotten that.

The whispering actors all lower their heads in unison. Kim Hyuk has arrived. His demeanor is as arrogant as it was at the audition.

He barely acknowledges the greetings from his juniors and walks straight toward someone ahead.

"Youngguk."

When he calls the name, the actor in front stops. It's Youngguk.

Youngguk turns and bows his head.

"Senior, I apologize for earlier."

Though Youngguk had already apologized once after the audition, Kim Hyuk hadn't accepted it. But now, perhaps because there are many onlookers, he does.

"No, I was testing you first. There's no need to be so humble. I'm just different from the petty folks over there."

Different, my foot.

Youngguk still remembers the fierce glare directed at him.

It was too vivid to be just acting; the intense immersion in his eyes was unmistakable.

The reason was obvious. It must have been because of the record-breaking drama appearance fee he once received.

"How about a drink tonight?"

Kim Hyuk continues with his arrogant expression.

"As your senior, I'll tell you how this industry works and what mistakes you might make as an actor. Your performance at the audition showed you have talent, but you still have many shortcomings. But that's understandable since you're young and inexperienced."

You fool, in terms of acting experience, I'm old enough to be your father.

"I'm sorry, Senior."

"Alright, there's a lounge I know well in Cheongdam. Oh?"

"I have to attend a director's wedding tomorrow, so it's hard for me to drink tonight. I'll contact you later when my schedule allows. Thank you for offering to guide me in acting."

Youngguk bows politely and walks away. Though the wedding is at noon, he sees no point in attending an unwanted drinking session to endure a young senior's drunken antics.

Watching Youngguk's retreating figure, Kim Hyuk sneers.

"That brat is really cocky."

Wedding.

A lavish chandelier illuminates the venue, and a sea of guests fills the hall.

A once-in-a-lifetime celebration.

The groom's face, dressed in formal attire, shows clear signs of nervousness. Considering the charisma he usually exudes on set, it's an unimaginable sight.

Gulp.

Director Shin Sunghyun's Adam's apple bobs noticeably. Though he's over forty, he's never been this busy in his life.

After greeting Chungmuro associates, he had to greet relatives who had come from the countryside by chartered bus.

The wedding day is so hectic that the preparations seem like child's play in comparison.

'It's a beautiful sight.'

Seeing his father's expression, a smile forms unknowingly on his face.

His father, who thought he'd never see his son get married, looks like a man who has realized a dream.

His father clasps Youngguk's hand and says,

"I heard it's thanks to you that our Sunghyun met his bride. Thank you so much. Next time, come down to the countryside with Sunghyun. I'll slaughter a pig and serve you a feast."

The wedding proceeds as planned. The host's witty remarks lift the pre-ceremony atmosphere. When the bride in her radiant dress walks under the chandelier lights, cheers erupt from all around.

Director Shin Sunghyun, standing in front of the officiant, has a face mixed with happiness and tension.

And he's not the only one feeling nervous.

"Yeonsu, are you nervous?"

Yeonsu, who is to perform the congratulatory song, also looks tense. Usually talkative, the girl now nods silently with her lips tightly pressed. Just then, the host's voice is heard.

"Next, we have a congratulatory song. We've got some incredible guests. Actress Yeonsu, the niece of bride Lee Soogyeong, and actor Jang Youngguk, the persona of groom Shin Sunghyun!"

Persona is a bit much.

Youngguk and Yeonsu walk onto the stage for the congratulatory song. Youngguk first congratulates the bride and groom on behalf of the nervous Yeonsu.

Yeonsu, now seemingly less tense, also congratulates her aunt and soon-to-be uncle.

The music starts, and the song begins. Yeonsu starts first.

"You are..."

"...!"

The first line is already a challenge. Trying to hide her nervousness, she doesn't move her mouth enough, causing her to go off-key.

Yeonsu's face turns pale. She must be incredibly anxious about making a mistake.

At that moment, Youngguk grabs her trembling hand. Feeling the warmth through their clasped hands, Yeonsu's expression brightens.

Despite the initial off-key note, Youngguk naturally harmonizes with her, continuing the song. The guests smile, more touched by their harmony than their singing skills.

Time flows like water.

The branches that were once filled with cherry blossoms now echo with the cries of cicadas waking from slumber.

Under the scorching sun, a dragonfly rests quietly on a jar, while Director Baek Janghoon waters the plants.

It's an unusually hot summer. Despite wearing hemp clothes, sweat beads already form on his back.

Tending to the garden is like tending to one's mind.

The golden koi swimming gracefully in the pond exude a serene elegance, rendering the heat insignificant.

Just then, someone rushes in from beyond the garden. Startled, the dragonfly on the jar takes flight.

"Careful not to fall."

Director Baek Janghoon scatters fish food, cautioning the newcomer. As the golden koi rise to the surface, Youngguk catches his breath and speaks.

"Grandfather, is it true?"

The fish food on the surface quickly runs out. Dusting off his wrinkled hands, Director Baek Janghoon tilts his wide-brimmed straw hat. At the end of his gaze, Youngguk's face, drenched in sweat, is visible.

'Even though he didn't show it, he must've been really anxious.'

It was the day to announce the casting for the movie 'Outlaw.' Each director has their own preferred method for casting. Some hold open auditions to find new faces, while others scout established actors whose image and acting skills match the characters in the script.

But Director Baek Janghoon had a different approach. Even high-profile actors eagerly sought to be part of his projects.

Hence the intense competition among Chungmuro's top actors for the villain role.

"The production team hasn't contacted your agency yet."

"In the morning, you didn't say anything. So I thought I didn't get the part..."

A summer breeze shakes the wind chimes. With a sly smile, Director Baek Janghoon replies,

"You rascal, it wouldn't be fun if I told you in advance."
