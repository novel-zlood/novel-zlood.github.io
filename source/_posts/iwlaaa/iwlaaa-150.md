Jang Youngguk Production.

As the filming neared its end, post-production began.

It's no exaggeration to say that the true value of a commercial film lies in its editing. Some meticulous directors even take over a year just for the editing phase.

"Driver Kim, let's watch the lift scene again."

Director Jang Youngguk's gaze was fixed on the editing screen. It was a scene where Jung Haesuk reveals his true nature while talking with friends.

True to the title "Outlaw," he doesn't hide his temperament from anyone. Especially with the ad-libs from Youngguk, who played Jung Haesuk, making the character even more vivid. However.

"Director, shouldn't we lift this scene?"

Editor Kim Jeongsu scratched his head. It wasn't that he disliked the scene. On the contrary, the ad-lib elevated the scene beyond the script.

But the sight of thick blood captured by the camera made him uneasy.

"It's not an R-rated movie, so if we include this, it will definitely get caught in the review."

It wasn't just stage blood, but real blood flowing from the actor's hand. The subsequent scenes were graphic enough to be in an R-rated film.

Kim Jeongsu also smacked his lips in regret. Commercial films are like that. Not only directing but also the film's age rating must be considered.

After all, the revenue potential varies greatly depending on whether it's rated for general audiences, 15+, or restricted to adults.

"Don't cut it. Use it as is."

"Director, if we do that..."

"I'll find a way to handle the review. Just use it as is."

Even if the film ended up being restricted to adults, he wouldn't back down. After all, how could the director kill the performance of an actor who had given his all?

The conversation between the editor and Director Jang Youngguk continued.

Editing a film doesn't end in a day. It's common to revise a single scene dozens or even hundreds of times.

"No matter how many times I see it, it's impressive."

Director Jang Youngguk held his admiration inside as he watched Youngguk on the editing screen.

He had certainly felt it while filming. Youngguk's acting was improving day by day.

Initially, he didn't think Youngguk could fully embody a villain. But.

"He's like a fish in water."

Youngguk perfectly embodied the villain as if he had been waiting for this role all along. It was as if all the roles he had played before were just preludes.

To an outsider, it might seem like Youngguk's true nature resembled Jung Haesuk's villainous character.

"To think he could expand his range so quickly."

Expanding an actor's range is not easy. If acting were as simple as stretching and shrinking a rubber band, the term "great actor" wouldn't exist.

Take Ahn Joonghyun, for example. He is now praised as a national actor and has established himself as a great actor in Korea, but his range wasn't wide from the beginning.

How many years did he work to shed the playboy image that had become a fixed notion on his face?

But Jang Youngguk was astonishing, peeling off layers like an onion and successfully taking on new roles each time.

At that moment.

"Director—!"

The assistant director burst into the editing room. Considering that no one is allowed in during editing, this was unusual. He didn't even knock.

Seeing the assistant director's face drenched in cold sweat like a downpour, it was clear that something serious had happened.

* * *

"The footage has been leaked?"

The atmosphere on set was icy. Even if they were walking on thin ice, it wouldn't be as chilling.

The cause of the thin ice would soon be revealed. It was because a part of the film had been leaked.

'This doesn't make sense.'

In this era, video leaks were rare.

Although mobile phones were becoming common, they didn't yet have cameras like they would in the future. The ones available were only used for calls.

"Hyung, what happened?"

Having worked with the Jang Youngguk crew as a cameo since childhood, there were many people he was close to. He approached the assistant director, with whom he was closest apart from the directors.

The assistant director's face also had dark circles, just like the others. He sighed and said,

"A newspaper contacted us saying they got hold of some footage. Youngguk, I'm really sorry. You know that scene where you got injured and delivered an intense ad-lib performance? It's that scene."

"How did they get that footage? Did it leak from the editing room?"

"Lower your voice. If it leaked from the editing room, we'd know who did it, and the atmosphere wouldn't be this bad. It looks like someone deliberately filmed it with a camcorder from a corner of the set."

"So, what did they say?"

The assistant director ran his fingers over his face and added,

"They demanded a reasonable sum of money, or they'd release the footage to the public."

"Don't they have any business ethics? What about copyright awareness?"

"Do you think a third-rate newspaper cares about that?"

If they cared about copyright, they wouldn't dare. In Hollywood, outsiders are strictly forbidden on set, and many productions are entirely closed off.

But in present-day Korea, awareness regarding intellectual property was still significantly lacking.

"Have you found the culprit yet?"

"That's why the atmosphere is so heavy within the production. We've reviewed the making-of footage, but no one looks suspicious. Everyone thinks it couldn't have been the crew."

The Jang Youngguk crew was well-known in Chungmuro. Most of the team had weathered many storms in Chungmuro. Even the junior staff had to have at least five years of experience to join the crew, so further explanation was unnecessary.

But money can blind and tempt people. No matter how strong the team's bond, there's no telling what might happen when money is involved.

There's a saying: you can predict the depths of a river, but not a person's heart.

"Just in case, we've started checking everyone's belongings from the directors to the junior staff and even the actors, from main to supporting cast."

"No camcorders found?"

The assistant director nodded briefly. Of course, even if I were the culprit, I wouldn't think of sneaking in a camcorder in this tense atmosphere.

At that moment, a certain actor caught Youngguk's eye.

"Chigon hyung."

It was Yang Chigon, who played Jung Haesuk's lawyer. He looked visibly startled by Youngguk's sudden call.

Youngguk had called him to sync up for a scene they had to shoot together, but he seemed as jittery as a puppy that needed to go out.

'Come to think of it.'

Yang Chigon always showed up on set even when he wasn't filming. At first, Youngguk thought he was just an enthusiastic actor eager to learn. After all, working with Director Jang Youngguk was a dream come true for Chungmuro actors. But.

'He didn't become famous.'

Reflecting on past memories, there was no actor named Yang Chigon. There could be various reasons why he might quit acting later.

But why did he seem so connected to today's incident?

Moreover, his constant sweating during their sync-ups only heightened Youngguk's suspicions.

* * *

"Scene number 121, Jung Haesuk’s Rage—!"

The slate clapped in the cold atmosphere. Even if the culprit wasn't found, filming had to continue.

The set was Jung Haesuk's office with a view of Seoul's nightscape. Among the expensive furniture, a glass ashtray flew and crashed.

"What?"

Jung Haesuk glared at his lawyer with wide eyes. His presence was so intimidating that the lawyer couldn't even speak properly, standing stiffly.

Jung Haesuk ran his long fingers over his face and smirked.

"I have to go back to that little shop, huh? Hey, Attorney Kim. If you have a mouth, use it. How can a dog tell its owner to come and go? Is this the best you lawyers could come up with?"

The lawyer swallowed and replied,

"The evidence collected by the prosecution is solid. We've contacted higher-ups to pressure them to close the case, but it doesn't seem easy. Even within the Central District Prosecutor's Office, Prosecutor Lee Howon is called an uncontrollable lunatic. Even the prosecutor-general intervened, but Lee is willing to resign over this."

At that moment, Jung Haesuk jumped up from his seat. He approached the standing lawyer, his eyes gleaming cruelly, and grabbed his hair. His voice sounded like he was about to punch him.

"So, you’re saying I have to go back as a suspect this time, not even as a witness?"

The lawyer shook his head vigorously. The actor Yang Chigon, captured by the camera, perfectly portrayed the frightened lawyer.

Having been by his client's side long enough, he knew how insane his boss could be. If he mentioned attending another hearing, he wouldn't leave the office with his legs intact.

"Hoo."

Jung Haesuk reclined on the sofa and looked up.

"My father shouldn't have let that guy off so easily. Was it because the old man got sentimental in his old age? I knew this would happen when he let that big guy off easily. Hey, Attorney Kim. How did that dog gather all this evidence? He couldn’t have done it alone. I told you to handle it properly."

The evidence Lee Howon gathered wasn't just about the traffic accident. Embezzlement, drugs, frequent assaults, and even attempted murder.

Lee Howon knew all of Jung Haesuk's skeletons. No matter how central a prosecutor he was, it would have been challenging to find all this evidence alone. He must have had an accomplice.

At that moment, Jung Haesuk twisted his lips and looked at the lawyer.

"Attorney Kim, did you give it to him?"

It was an ad-lib not in the script. Perhaps that's why actor Yang Chigon looked so flustered, as if admitting he was the culprit.
