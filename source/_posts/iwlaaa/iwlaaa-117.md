The Beast-Man.

This term emerged after the historical drama "Yeonsan, the King's Secret" aired. Ironically, what could have been a term highlighted years later was coined so quickly because of the crown prince's push-up scene. The scene depicted him working out intensely, preparing for potential schemes and assassinations. The sight of his muscles rippling through the early dawn light was enough to captivate many women's hearts.

"That was insane. I've never seen back muscles rippling like that before. He's not even a bodybuilder, so how is that possible?"

"Don't get me started. When he played the butcher Lee Gyeol, his arm veins popped out when he held the axe. I liked Lee Gyeol way more than Lee Yung. It's that rough, macho image. Should we get his autograph when he comes to class?"

"Hey! If push-ups have enchanted you all so much, why not join the rugby team? You two would make perfect managers. What do you say? The recruitment period isn't over yet."

"Oh, oppa, come on!"

The classroom was already buzzing with talk about Yeong-guk. It was no surprise, given that "Yeonsan, the King's Secret" had ignited a historical drama craze in Korea. This was proof that a fusion historical drama, rather than a traditional one, captivated the public's discerning tastes.

Kim Dong-jin, a third-year law student, grumbled as he returned to his seat.

"Why does everyone hate the rugby team so much? Everyone's talking about 'beast men' these days. The real beast men are all in the rugby team, right, Jae-hee?"

"I don't know. But why have you been in the rugby team since freshman year without joining any department clubs?"

"Even if I joined a department club, all they'd talk about is the bar exam. It's obvious I'll have to study in Sillim-dong after graduation, so I need to find some romance during my college days. Besides, I never dreamed of passing the bar exam while still an undergrad."

"You'll end up serving active duty in the military at this rate."

"Wow, such harsh words. They say 'love your comrades, love your country,' but we're all doomed. If I get drafted, so be it. After graduation, I'll study in Sillim-dong, and if it doesn't work out, that's my fate. When you pass the bar exam and set up a law office, hire me. By the way, Jae-hee, aren't you interested in being a rugby team manager?"

"No, I'm not. I'm the president of the academic society. I'm too busy with student council work to join a central club. Dong-jin, is your brain made of muscle too?"

It's the season when cherry blossoms are in full bloom. On the main street of Korea University, club recruitment is in full swing. While all the students are talking about blind dates and springtime youth, the law department has a different atmosphere. It's probably because the first-round results of the bar exam are about to be announced.

Shin Jae-hee, who also took the first round of the bar exam, has a lot on her mind. But what's most troubling her mind is one particular person.

"Oh, Yeong-guk is here!"

'Oh, what a smooth talker.'

If someone were to pick Yeong-guk's closest friend in the department, it would undoubtedly be third-year Kim Dong-jin. With his physique, he would fit better in the PE department than in law. Dong-jin approached Yeong-guk and naturally put his arm around his shoulder.

"Oh, beast man. Your back muscles are no joke!"

"Oppa, why are you doing this again this morning?"

"Yeong-guk, why don't you join the rugby team? You definitely have the build for it. Just look at those sturdy thighs. Normally, you have to pass a test to join, but I'll put in a good word with the club president. What do you say?"

"No, thanks. And why do you keep dragging me around?"

"Man, you can't just sit in the back every day and study. Where's the motivation in that? Just come with me and sit together from now on."

"Oppa, you're not asking because you need help with a problem, right?"

"Hehe, smart juniors sure catch on quick!"

Yeong-guk's legal knowledge was on par with, if not better than, other undergraduates. His detailed insights and future-oriented legal perspectives were so impressive that even professors gave him a thumbs up.

Shin Jae-hee was startled to see Yeong-guk sitting next to her. She turned her head, afraid their eyes might meet. Noticing this, Dong-jin spoke without tact.

"Jae-hee, our beast man Yeong-guk is here. Say hi!"

Ugh, that jerk.

* * *

A broad-shouldered figure walked through the cherry blossom-filled campus. The cherry blossoms on his cardigan looked like intricate embroidery crafted by an artisan.

Even with a hat pulled low, passing students couldn't help but glance at him.

At that moment, a young man waved towards the pond in the center of the campus.

"Jung-seok hyung!"

It had been a while since they last met due to their busy schedules. It was none other than Song Jung-seok, whom he had met years ago in Busan. Unlike before, he was now appearing on both TV and movie screens, but his appearance hadn't changed much.

With a baggy shirt, old jeans, and untidy hair, anyone who didn't know better would think he was a bar exam student rather than a celebrity.

"Why do you dress like this when you make good money?"

"Is that how you greet someone after a long time? I dress like this for method acting. My next role is a bar exam student from Noryangjin."

"Do people not recognize you dressed like this?"

"Most people just think I look like Song Jung-seok and walk past. By the way, Yeong-guk, you're wearing a hat even at school now that you're getting popular. Do you think you can hide that handsome face?"

Despite meeting after a long time, it wasn't awkward. After all, he had been the only senior to give him advice in the past.

They walked towards the campus cafeteria to have lunch together. Occasionally, people recognized them, but since they were eating, most just glanced without approaching.

Song Jung-seok took a bite of his pork cutlet and said,

"I was hoping to get a meal from you after a long time, and it's just pork cutlet?"

"Why, this is the most popular dish at our school. If you come late, the meal tickets are sold out, and you can't eat it even if you want to. If you don't want it, give it to me. I'll eat two."

"I'm just saying. I never thought I'd have lunch at Korea University's cafeteria. By the way, Yeong-guk, did you know our agency signed Ji Dong-yeon?"

The mention of Ji Dong-yeon made him look up. Ji Dong-yeon was a senior he had met while preparing for the National Theater Festival.

"Ji hyung praised you a lot. He said you were the person who gave him a turning point in his acting career. Hearing his praise made me feel proud, like I was seeing my younger self."

When Ji Dong-yeon was struggling with debt, a word of encouragement had meant a lot to him.

He didn't expect Ji Dong-yeon to join the same agency as Song Jung-seok, but he was glad things were working out for him.

"By the way, do you know Son Hwawon?"

"Are you talking about the movie actor Son Hwawon?"

"Yes, he's three years older than you and has no TV drama experience but has been acting in movies since he was a child. He's quite famous in Chungmuro, so you must know him."

How could he not? He wasn't famous now, but he would later become the first Korean actor to win the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival.

In his past life, he had many actor friends when he was famous. But his hysterical personality had caused all those relationships to fall apart.

The first person he lost contact with was none other than movie actor Son Hwawon.

Of course, it was one-sided because he couldn't overcome his inferiority complex. After all, one was always the lead, and the other was always a supporting actor.

"He really wants to meet you. He'll be entering TV dramas soon and needs someone his age to talk to frankly. I know you're busy filming, but he kept asking, so I thought I'd ask you."

'Huh.'

In his past life, he had always sought advice from Son Hwawon. Like Mozart and Salieri, he had felt a sense of inadequacy watching Son Hwawon's acting.

"I'll meet him."

There was no need to think further. He knew now the kindness Son Hwawon had shown him in the past.

Song Jung-seok smiled as if he expected this answer and took a spoonful of rice.

"Seeing white rice reminds me of the meals your mother used to make. You didn't know at the time, but the advice you gave me became the foundation of my acting career."

"Why are you being so sentimental all of a sudden?"

"This kid, calling it sentimental when I'm trying to set the mood. Everyone's talking about 'beast men' these days, and now you don't even recognize your hyung."

"Oh, stop calling me that. It's giving me a complex. I'm not a beast man."

"Alright, beast man. How's your mother? I haven't contacted her since New Year's."

He suddenly thought of his mother at the Namhang Market. She must be busy with customers right now.

"I'm planning to bring her to Seoul soon. I should find a place and live with her."

"Have you told her?"

"I mentioned it before, but she refused. But I want her to stop doing hard work. I called her a few days ago, and she still insists on staying, so I'm worried. The shop work must be tough for her alone."

"Don't rush the decision. If she doesn't want to come, she has her reasons. Who knows, maybe she's met a nice gentleman there and is dating?"

"Oh, come on."

"See? Sometimes you seem so mature, but then you show how young you still are. Isn't your mother a woman too?"

After the conversation, Song Jung-seok stuffed another piece of pork cutlet into his mouth. Seeing the sauce on his lips, he wondered if his mother had a different reason for wanting to stay at the market besides her attachment to the vendors.

* * *

It's the season for flatfish. Its chewy and firm texture makes it a popular choice for sashimi among tourists visiting Namhang.

With the flood of customers gone, it was time for a break.

Despite their tired legs, the vendors' faces always had smiles.

"It's already lunchtime."

It's late for lunch, but no one complains. This is their way of life.

Just as she was about to head to the neighboring stall, she remembered that Mrs. Yang mentioned attending a school meeting for her daughter, Myung-ja, today. She wanted to have lunch with the other vendors, but their opening times and lunch breaks differed, so it wasn't possible.

'I hope Guk is eating well.'

Despite the hard work, her thoughts were always with her son.

A while ago, Yeong-guk had called. After much hesitation, he asked her to come to Seoul and live with him.

But she had shaken her head on the other end of the line.

'I feel comfortable staying in Namhang.'

City life was too complicated and stressful. Moreover, the shop work had become easier with time.

Thinking back to when she first set up her fish stall, she realized how much time had passed.

Her once soft hands were now calloused, and her face, tanned by the sea breeze, bore the marks of time.

"Is this what Guk wanted me to put on my face?"

She applied the cream her son had sent around her eyes. It wouldn't erase the wrinkles instantly, but to her, her face was still the most beautiful.

Having not worn makeup for so long, even applying cream felt strange. But her beauty from the past still shone through.

"Oh my, where's my mind?"

She stood up quickly, feeling embarrassed after staring at the mirror for so long. She remembered she had put a stew on the burner.

"The soup bowls should be here."

She reached for the soup bowls in the cupboard. But her hand couldn't reach. She stood on tiptoe, stretching her fingers, but the bowls seemed to move further inside. Just then,

Suddenly, a shadow loomed from behind. A long arm reached out and grabbed the bowls from the back of the cupboard.

Startled, she turned around to see Mr. Kim from the side dish shop standing there awkwardly, holding the bowls.

"Oh, it looked like you were having trouble reaching them..."

She finally calmed down. For some reason, Mr. Kim always made her smile. She took the bowls and asked kindly,

"Did you come to buy cockles? They're not in season anymore."

"No, that's not it."

"Then?"

"It's not that..."

Mr. Kim scratched his head.

"Would you like to have lunch together?"
