The Beast-Man.

This is a newly coined term that emerged after the historical drama "Yeonsan, The King's Secret" aired. Ironically, why did this term, which was only spotlighted years later, come into existence so quickly? It was none other than because of the Crown Prince's push-up scene. The sight of him gritting his teeth and fully immersing himself in exercise to prepare for any impending political schemes and assassinations was enough to stir the hearts of many women.

The sight of his splitting muscles in the rising dawn was more than enough to shake the hearts of many women.

"Seriously, it was crazy. I've never seen someone's back muscles split like that. He's not even a bodybuilder, so how is that possible?"

"Don't even get me started. When he played Baekjeong Yi-Kyul, the veins on his wrist popped out when he held the axe. I liked Yi-Kyul much more than Lee-Yung. It's that rough macho image. Should we wait a bit and ask for his autograph when he comes to class?"

"Hey! If push-ups captivate you all this much, why don't you join the rugby club? I think you two would make perfect managers. What do you think? The recruitment period is still open."

"Oh, come on, sunbae!"

The lecture hall is already buzzing with talk about Yeongguk. It's no wonder since "Yeonsan, The King's Secret" caused a boom in historical dramas in South Korea. It was proof that the fusion historical drama, rather than a traditional one, had captured the picky tastes of the public.

Kim Dongjin, a third-year law student, returns to his seat, grumbling.

"Seriously, why do people hate the rugby club so much? These days, everyone talks about beast-men. The real beast-men are all in the rugby club! Right, Jaehee?"

"I don't know, but why are you in the rugby club all the time since freshman year without joining any departmental clubs?"

"Even if I join a departmental club, all they talk about is the bar exam. It's obvious that I'll have to go to Sillim-dong and study, so I need to find some romance during my university days. Besides, I don't even dream of passing the bar exam while I'm an undergrad."

"You're going to end up serving in the military, you know that?"

"Wow, that's harsh. They say comradeship is about loving your country, but we're all doomed. If I end up serving, then so be it. I'll study in Sillim-dong after graduation, and if it doesn't work out, that's my fate. Jaehee, when you pass the bar exam and open your law office, hire me. By the way, aren't you interested in managing the rugby club?"

"Nope. I'm the president of the academic society. I'm too busy with student council work to join a central club. Dongjin, are you all muscle even in your brain?"

It's the season when cherry blossoms are in full bloom. The central road of Korea University is already bustling with club recruitments.

While the spring atmosphere makes all the students talk about blind dates and spring romances, the law department feels unusually tense. It's probably because the announcement of the first round of the bar exam results is approaching.

Shin Jaehee, who also took the first round of the bar exam, can't help but have a complicated mind. But the most complicated thing in her mind is none other than a single person.

"Oh, Yeongguk is here!"

'Oh, that cheeky guy.'

If you had to pick the person closest to Jang Yeongguk in the department, it would undoubtedly be third-year Kim Dongjin. Judging by his appearance, he looks more like a physical education student than a law student. Dongjin approaches Yeongguk and casually puts his arm around his shoulder.

"Oh, the beast-man. Your back muscles are no joke!"

"Ah, sunbae, why are you like this from the morning?"

"Yeongguk, why don't you join the rugby club? No matter how I look at it, you have the build for rugby. Just look at those solid thighs. Usually, you need to pass a test to join, but I'll talk to the club president and get you in. Come on?"

"No, and why do you keep dragging me?"

"Man, how can you get motivated if you sit at the back and study alone every day? Stop talking and follow me. From today, sit with me."

"Sunbae, you're not asking because you want help with questions, right?"

"Hehe. Smart juniors are quick on the uptake!"

It's no exaggeration to say that Jang Yeongguk's knowledge of law was on par with other undergraduates. His detailed perspective and foresight in legal matters were so impressive that professors gave him thumbs up.

At that moment, Shin Jaehee is startled as she sees Yeongguk sitting next to her. She turns her head, afraid of making eye contact. Seeing this, Dongjin speaks up without noticing.

"Jaehee, our beast-man Yeongguk is here. Say hello!"

Geez, that guy.

* * *

A broad-shouldered figure walks through the campus where cherry blossoms are falling. The cherry blossom petals on his cardigan look like embroidery crafted by a master artisan.

Even though he wears a hat pulled down low, passersby can't help but glance at him.

At that moment, a young man waves his hand towards Cheongdam (the pond) located at the center of the university.

"Jeongseok hyung!"

It's been a while since they've met, as both have been busy with their schedules. It was none other than Song Jeongseok, whom he had met years ago in Busan. Unlike before, he now appears on both TV and movie screens, but his appearance hasn't changed much.

With a loose shirt, old jeans, and unkempt hair, anyone who didn't know him might mistake him for a student preparing for an exam rather than a celebrity.

"Why are you dressed like this when you make good money?"

"Is it okay for you to nag me as soon as we meet after a long time? This is all for method acting, you know. I'm preparing for my next role as a student studying for exams in Noryangjin."

"Do people not recognize you when you dress like this?"

"Most people just think I look like Song Jeongseok and pass by. By the way, Yeongguk, you're quite popular now, but you still wear your hat low at school. Do you think you can hide that handsome face?"

Even though it's been a while since they met, it doesn't feel awkward. It makes sense since he was the only senior who gave him advice in his past life.

They walked to the campus cafeteria to have lunch together. Occasionally, people recognized them, but since they were eating, most just glanced and didn't approach.

Song Jeongseok takes a bite of his pork cutlet and says,

"I thought I'd get a proper meal from you after a long time, but it's just pork cutlet?"

"Hey, this is the most popular dish in our school. If you come late, you can't get it because the meal tickets sell out. If you don't want it, give it to me. I'll eat two."

"I'm just saying. I never thought I'd have lunch at Korea University's cafeteria in my life. By the way, do you know that Ji Dongyeon signed an exclusive contract with our agency?"

Yeongguk raises his head at the mention of Ji Dongyeon. He was an actor he met while preparing for the Korea Drama Festival and had a connection with.

"Senior Ji praised you a lot. He said you were the benefactor who gave him a turning point in his acting career. Hearing him praise you made me feel proud, as if I were looking at my past self."

Ji Dongyeon seemed quite grateful for telling him to get his act together when he was struggling with debt.

Yeongguk was relieved to hear that things were going well for him, even though he hadn't expected him to join the same agency as Song Jeongseok.

"By the way, do you know Son Hwa-won?"

"Are you talking about the actor Son Hwa-won?"

"Yeah, he's three years older than you and has no experience in dramas yet, but he started as a child actor in movies. He's quite famous in Chungmuro, so you should know him."

How could he not know? Though not famous now, in the future, he would become the first Korean actor to win Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival.

In his past life, Yeongguk had connections with many actors, but his hysterical personality had severed those relationships.

Among them, the first person he lost contact with was none other than the actor Son Hwa-won.

Of course, it was because he couldn't overcome his inferiority complex and pushed him away, but still. One was always a leading actor, and the other was always a supporting actor.

"That guy really wants to meet you. He needs to get into dramas soon, and he seems to need someone around his age to talk to openly. I know you're busy with filming, but he insisted, so I'm just asking."

‘Huh.’

In his past life, he was the one who always sought advice. Like Mozart and Salieri, he felt a sense of inferiority watching his acting.

"I'll meet him."

There was no need to think about it. He now understood the kindness that Son Hwa-won had shown in the past.

Song Jeongseok smiles, as if he knew Yeongguk would say that, and scoops a spoonful of rice.

"Whenever I see white rice, it reminds me of the meals your mother used to make. You probably didn't know back then, but the advice you gave me became the foundation of my acting career."

"Why are you making it so cheesy all of a sudden?"

"You brat, I'm trying to set the mood and talk, and you call it cheesy. These days, everyone talks about beast-men, and now you're treating your senior like this."

"Ah, stop calling me that. It's driving me crazy. I'm not a beast-man."

"Fine, beast-man. How's your mother? I called her during the last holiday but haven't been in touch since."

Suddenly, he thought of his mother at Namhang Market. She must be busy dealing with the flood of customers.

"I'm planning to bring her to Seoul soon. I need to find a house and live with her."

"Did you tell your mother?"

"I mentioned it before, but she refused. But I don't want her to do hard work anymore. I called her a few days ago, and she still refuses, so I'm worried. Managing the store alone must be too much for her."

"Don't rush your decision. If your mother doesn't want to come, there must be a reason. Who knows, she might be dating a nice man there?"

"Oh, come on. That's nonsense."

"See? Sometimes you seem so mature, but other times you still seem like a kid. Your mother is a woman too, you know."

Finishing the conversation, Song Jeongseok shoves the pork cutlet into his mouth. Watching him with sauce smeared around his mouth, Yeongguk wonders if there might be another reason his mother wants to stay at Namhang Market besides the camaraderie with other merchants.

* * *

It's the season for flounder. Known as a representative spring sashimi, its chewy and firm texture whets the appetite of many tourists visiting Namhang.

As the flood of customers quickly recedes, it's finally time to take a breather.

The legs of the merchants feel as heavy as if they were stuck in mudflats, but their faces are always filled with happiness.

"It's already lunchtime."

It's a much later lunch than others, but no one complains. This is their way of life and livelihood.

While thinking about joining the other merchants for lunch, she remembers that Mrs. Yang mentioned she would be attending a parents' meeting for her daughter Myeongja today. She wants to have lunch with the other merchants, but it's hard to match the timing since everyone opens and eats at different times.

'I wonder if my Guk is eating well.'

Despite the hardships of working by the sea, as a mother, she can't help but think about her son.

Her son called her a few days ago after a long time. After much hesitation, he asked her to come to Seoul and live with him.

But she shook her head over the phone, where her son couldn't see.

'I feel more comfortable staying at Namhang.'

City life is too complicated and stressful. Besides, she's used to the store work now, and it has become easier.

Thinking back to the early days when she first started her fish stall, she realizes how much time has passed.

Her once fair and smooth hands are now covered in calluses, and her face, weathered by the sea breeze, shows lines that mark the passage of time.

"This is what Guk told me to apply on my face, right?"

She applies the face cream her son sent her to the wrinkles around her eyes. While it won't erase the wrinkles immediately, her face remains as beautiful as ever.

Since it's been a long time since she last wore makeup, even applying face cream feels awkward. But her beauty remains unchanged.

"Oh dear, look at me."

She abruptly stands up, embarrassed after staring into the mirror for a long time. She suddenly remembers that she left the stew on the burner.

The lid of the pot rises and falls, urging her to hurry.

"The soup bowls should be here."

She reaches for the soup bowls in the cupboard. But no matter how hard she tries, she can't reach them. Standing on tiptoe and stretching her hand as far as she can, she barely touches them, but they slide further back into the cupboard. Just then,

Swoosh.

A shadow suddenly appears behind her. A long arm reaches out and retrieves the soup bowls from the corner of the cupboard.

She turns around, startled, to find Mr. Kim from the side dish store standing there awkwardly, holding the soup bowls.

"Oh, you looked like you were having trouble reaching them..."

She calms her startled heart. For some reason, she can't help but smile whenever she sees Mr. Kim. She takes the soup bowls and kindly asks,

"Did you come to buy cockles? They're not in season anymore, so the quality is so-so."

"Oh, no."

"Then what?"

"Actually..."

Mr. Kim scratches his head.

"Would you like to have lunch together?"
