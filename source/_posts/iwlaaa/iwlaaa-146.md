"Nice to meet you, I'm Monica Rossellini."

After shaking hands, she gave a typical Italian cheek kiss on both cheeks.

While Youngguk took it casually, CEO Kim Sunghwan seemed somewhat surprised.

It was understandable, as cheek kisses are usually exchanged among close acquaintances, and although he had seen many actresses as a company representative, it was rare to encounter someone as stunning as Monica.

"Youngguk, you have no idea how much effort I've put into meeting you. You're the first person to make Desiderio so passionate."

Monica's words were translated into Korean by an interpreter with a long mustache. The meaning was conveyed correctly, but the interpreter's foreign accent was unmistakable.

Youngguk was curious as to why Desiderio was so eager to court him.

"Why did you want me so badly?"

Desiderio is a brand coveted by top international agencies. The fact that even top models submit their resumes to be selected by Desiderio made it clear.

It was beyond unusual for such a brand to seek out an actor who had just started gaining fame in Korea.

"I saw the movie you starred in at Cannes, ‘Confession of a Priest.’ I couldn't get over Kim Mujin's character for months. And I realized, ah, this is the person. I've finally found Desiderio's muse."

Lately, he had been hearing words like "persona" and "muse" often.

It was hard to get used to the fact that someone was inspired by him.

In his previous life, he couldn't even imagine becoming someone's, or something's, muse.

"If Mr. Jang Youngguk is agreeable, we would like to offer you an exclusive modeling contract with Desiderio. We will provide the best treatment in every aspect, including the signing bonus."

As the elegant Italian with the mustache translated, CEO Kim Sunghwan's eyes widened in amazement.

It was understandable, as not anyone could become an exclusive model for Desiderio. It was only possible for world-renowned actors or top-tier models.

Moreover, the best treatment following the offer made his jaw drop.

Just then, the scheduled meal was served. Had the staff not knocked on the sliding door, CEO Kim Sunghwan might have drooled from the desire. The conditions were that tempting.

Although he had experience shooting luxury perfume ads, this was on a different level. Desiderio was known as the luxury of luxuries.

"Does it suit your taste?"

When Youngguk asked in English, Monica nodded while tossing her unique silver hair.

Her clumsy use of chopsticks to pick up japchae looked unusual. On the outside, she seemed like a cold and elegant actress.

After finishing their meal and enjoying a brief tea time, Monica took out a cigarette and put it in her mouth. Although no one else was smoking, she hesitated for a moment but smiled when CEO Kim Sunghwan signaled that it was okay.

As the gray smoke rose, Monica elaborated.

"Sorry, I'm a heavy smoker. I'll let Jordana here inform you of the exact contract terms tomorrow. If there are any details you don't like or want to add, please feel free to let us know. Now, let me ask one last time. Mr. Youngguk, are you willing to join Desiderio?"

After hearing Monica's intention through the interpreter, Youngguk gave a light chuckle. Monica seemed to have already been convinced, judging by CEO Kim Sunghwan's reaction.

It was surprising enough that Desiderio offered an exclusive model contract, but the chief designer personally visiting Korea was unprecedented in the Korean entertainment industry. However.

"I think I need to think about it a bit more."

The unexpected answer surprised CEO Kim Sunghwan. But Monica smiled as if she had anticipated it.

"It makes you even more appealing."

The filming set was buzzing with excitement. Although it was Chuseo (處暑), signaling the end of the summer heat, the atmosphere was even hotter.

The reason was none other than the Western woman with silver hair.

Not only the general public who were visiting the set but also the staff couldn't help but glance at her.

- Can I visit the film set?

Although the contract wasn't signed on the spot, Monica wanted to visit the filming set.

The set usually prohibited the entry of outsiders, but Director Baek Janghoon gladly accepted. It was a one-time visit, and Director Baek was also curious why Desiderio's chief designer was so ardently courting Youngguk.

As the assistant director passed by Youngguk, he asked slyly.

"Youngguk, she's not your girlfriend, right?"

No way. For someone who had never dated to have an international relationship? Youngguk shook his head, but the assistant director smacked his lips regretfully. It was clear to anyone that Monica's intense gaze was directed at Youngguk.

"Do they really need me that much?"

The reason Youngguk said he needed to think about the contract was simple.

Even domestic ads take quite a bit of time. Let alone an international ad. Considering Desiderio's reputation, it wouldn't be surprising if it ended up on the Times Square billboard.

Moreover, he hadn't yet fully understood why Desiderio was so keen on offering him this ad with such generosity.

"It's not bad to be cautious."

There's a saying to even tap a stone bridge before crossing it.

He had learned many times in his past life that in social life, if something looks too good to eat, you might end up with unexpected losses. Anyway.

"The scene is quite something."

Anyone seeing it might think she's the daughter of a mafia boss. Although she was standing in a corner of the set, trying not to disturb others, being with two Italians with long mustaches made it look like a scene from a mafia movie.

It was then.

"Actor Jang."

It was Director Baek Janghoon. While he would call him comfortably in private, he never failed to call him "Actor Jang" in public places like the set.

The two discussed the shooting angle, movements, and the use of props for quite some time. After talking for a while, Director Baek glanced at Monica and said,

"It seems like she won't leave Korea until you accept, Actor Jang."

"Director, what do you mean?"

"You can tell just by looking. She looks smitten, just like when a director meets an actor they like. It shows how much she wants you for the brand ad."

Then Director Baek added with a mischievous expression.

"Hmm, or maybe she wants both professional and personal?"

"Scene number 61, The Dignity of the Chairman!"

Commercial film shoots usually last about 3 to 4 months. Typically, the post-production period is longer than the main shooting period.

In that sense, the shooting for 'Outlaw' was just past its mid-point.

Just as the sun that seemed to dominate the sky eventually dims into a handful of red light, Jeongil Group was the same.

Chairman Wang's condition on the sickbed was serious. Everyone knew that his life had reached its twilight years.

Thus, the sudden convening of the executive meeting was enough to make everyone tense.

"There's talk of restructuring the management. Shouldn't we all protest together? At this rate, we'll not only lose our positions but also be ousted by some young punk."

"Director Park is right. If this continues, even if the Chairman recovers, we'll all be replaced. President Kim Mincheol, you should speak up. Surely the Chairman left some instructions?"

"Ahem."

Kim Mincheol of Jeongil Foods just licked his dry lips without showing much reaction.

The ones most fervently arguing at the executive meeting were none other than the elders. They had built their reputations alongside Jeongil Group from the beginning.

Chairman Wang's sudden absence felt like a crisis to them. Especially since it was publicly known that Jeong Haesuk was being designated as Chairman Wang's successor.

"So, you're suggesting we go against the Chairman's last wishes?"

"Last wishes? What nonsense! The Chairman isn't even dead yet. Director Kim, you should think before you speak!"

"Well, it's not like I said anything wrong. The succession plan is clear, it's just a matter of timing. I don't understand why you're all so scared."

On the other hand, some were eagerly anticipating Jeong Haesuk's ascension.

A company is like a jungle. There's a saying that you have to grab the right rope to survive.

There was a tension-filled confrontation among the executives.

"Who's scared! Do you know our relationship with the Chairman? The Chairman always put the company first. Even if the succession is complete, this arbitrary reshuffling of the management is..."

Director Park, who had been passionately arguing, fell silent. The meeting room door opened, and someone entered.

Walking confidently, flanked by others, was Jeong Haesuk.

He naturally took the head seat. The seat that originally belonged to Chairman Wang. His face was filled with an inscrutable smile.

He then casually picked at his ear and spoke.

"Director Park."

Hearing his name, Director Park's face turned pale.

"Do you prefer second-hand or new?"

"Sorry?"

"I mean, when buying something. Old and worn items are always a bit off-putting. There's a saying that new wine should be put in new wineskins, right? I'm the same. I hate it when things get old and lose their elasticity, like mold growing in place."

Jeong Haesuk crossed his legs and took out a cigarette.

No one had ever smoked in the meeting room before. But Jeong Haesuk naturally lit his cigarette.

"Director Park."

Through the gray smoke, a sharp wind seemed to blow as Jeong Haesuk's piercing gaze landed on Director Park.

"Are you really not scared?"

Watching this from a corner of the set, Monica felt her heart pounding.

Although the lines were in Korean, so she couldn’t understand the script, why did Youngguk, sitting in the head seat and smoking while smirking, look so sexy?
