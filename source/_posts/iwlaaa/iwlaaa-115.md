"Interesting?"

The face of Seo Yeonwoo, a teaching assistant in the Law Department of Korea University, was filled with curiosity. It was because of the course adjustment table of a first-year undergraduate student reflected on the monitor.

As is the case with many university departments, the Law Department of Korea University also sets up a curriculum for first-year students rather than allowing them to register for courses on their own.

First-year students find course registration unfamiliar and do not know which subjects to take to meet the credit requirements.

However, the course adjustment application of the freshman reflected on the monitor was so peculiar that it was almost bizarre.

"Even if we overlook the course adjustment..."

"What's going on, Assistant Seo?"

At that moment, another teaching assistant who entered the department office asked. Seo Yeonwoo, thinking it's better to show than to explain, turned the monitor to show them.

The other teaching assistant, who was looking at the timetable on the monitor, squinted their eyes. Then, as soon as they saw the student ID number, their eyes widened.

"Isn't this a freshman? Even if they are taking other major courses that are usually taken in the second year, how can they take Professor Shin's class? It's a third-year major curriculum that requires prerequisite courses. Even if they applied for this course, Professor Shin won't allow it anyway..."

"He already gave permission."

"Really? Well, even if that's the case, they've canceled all their general education classes and filled their schedule with only major courses. How do they plan to graduate? It's obvious they'll end up with academic warnings."

"Who knows, maybe they plan to stay in university for ten years."

Seo Yeonwoo shrugged. Occasionally, there were freshmen like this, although rare. After all, wasn't this a department where only the brightest students from all over the country gathered? Trusting only their abilities, they would apply for major courses starting in their first year.

However, most of them ended up receiving academic warnings and taking summer courses.

After all, the undergraduate students taking major courses were also top students from all over the country. Competing with them from the freshman year was not a realistic plan.

"I'm sure the head of the academic society mentioned it during the orientation. He told the freshmen not to change their course registration forms from the curriculum during the course adjustment period, even if they were confident."

"There's always one or two who don't listen. But should we approve this or not?"

"Just approve it. It's their own doing, and they're adults now, so they should take responsibility. By the way, who's this freshman? I want to see their face when they come to the department office later."

Seo Yeonwoo pointed at the name of the freshman on the monitor and said.

"Jang Youngguk."

* * *

The lecture hall was full of students. Even though it was a new semester, everyone seemed familiar with each other, chatting in groups.

It made sense since it was a third-year class, and everyone probably knew each other. The moment I entered the lecture hall, all eyes turned to me in unison.

I didn't mind and placed my bag on one side of the lecture hall and sat down.

"Jang Youngguk?"

It was the head of the academic society, Shin Jaehee. Having met her briefly during the orientation, I bowed my head to greet her first. She barely acknowledged my greeting and added with a puzzled look.

"Did you come to the wrong lecture hall?"

"Isn't this the Criminal Mock Trial class?"

"Yes, but it's a third-year major course. Freshmen can't take it because of the prerequisite courses."

At that moment, an elderly professor entered the lecture hall. Shin Jaehee motioned for me to leave, but I didn't mind and took out the book needed for the Criminal Mock Trial class from my bag.

Seeing me take out the major textbook, Shin Jaehee widened her eyes and returned to her seat.

"Hello everyone. The new semester has begun, and spring has arrived. It's refreshing to see your faces after the winter. The Criminal Mock Trial class will proceed in a format similar to actual trials but in a condensed manner."

The elderly professor was none other than Professor Shin Jeonggil, the head of the department. His white hair complemented his kindly smile.

Soon, Professor Shin Jeonggil began calling the roll. As he was calling in order of student ID numbers, I was inevitably the last one.

"Jang Youngguk."

When Professor Shin Jeonggil called my name, the curiosity of the students in the lecture hall turned into a palpable buzz. Some students started chatting among themselves, seemingly unable to understand. Then, the head of the academic society, Shin Jaehee, raised her hand.

"Professor, may I ask a question?"

"Feel free to ask anything you're curious about."

"I was wondering, the Criminal Mock Trial class requires the prerequisite course Criminal Law II, which is a second-year major course. How can a freshman take this class?"

Professor Shin Jeonggil answered with a kindly smile.

"Jang Youngguk requested to take the Criminal Mock Trial class. He is currently taking the prerequisite Criminal Law II course simultaneously as a second-year major, so I allowed him to take this class as well."

"Pardon? Is that even possible, Professor?"

"Yes, it is at the discretion of the professor. In fact, this class has a reputation for being difficult, so not many students want to take it. Jang Youngguk is the first student to actively request to take this class."

"But still, won't this affect other students? The Criminal Mock Trial class is conducted in a mock trial format, and if Jang Youngguk is not prepared, it could negatively impact the other students."

Perhaps because she was the head of the academic society, she was quite bold. How many students could speak like that to a professor, especially the head of the department? On one hand, I thought she had a point.

At that moment, the elderly professor looked at me with piercing eyes and asked.

"If Jang Youngguk is unable to keep up with the class or if his lack of knowledge in criminal law affects the mock trials, he agreed to withdraw from the class, correct?"

"Yes, Professor."

Other students widened their eyes at my agreement to risk my grades. However, isn't it something that needs to be tested to see who will come out on top?

Nevertheless, the head of the academic society, Shin Jaehee, looked at me with cold eyes, just like the day she told me I had chili powder on my face.

MBS Drama Department.

Although it was late, the lights in the head's office were still on. Like the calm before the storm, only silence filled the room where Drama Department Head Kim Wonsuk sat alone.

He kept pressing and releasing the button on his pen repeatedly, a clear sign of his tension. Then,

Knock, knock.

At the sound of a knock from beyond the office, he unintentionally dropped his pen on the floor. Kim Wonsuk picked up the pen and briefly said, "Come in."

The person who entered was none other than a famous PD.

"Head, you haven't left yet?"

"Why?"

"Since you haven't left, no one else can leave either. I came to check as the vanguard."

"You guys usually don't even care about me, so what's this reconnaissance?"

Although Kim Wonsuk said that, he didn't seem displeased. It was because the timing of this famous PD's visit was perfect. He had many questions to ask him.

"Since you're here, have a cup of coffee before you go."

"I’ll make it."

"No, sit down. When else will you have coffee made by me?"

The famous PD smiled lightly and sat down. The worn-out sofa sank with a puff, as if reflecting the Drama Department Head's worries.

The famous PD knew why the head was so tense. The head handed him a cup of coffee and continued.

"It's been a while since we sat and had coffee like this, hasn't it?"

"It’s been a little over ten years since I assisted you as an FD."

"Back then, having a cup of coffee on set was the only pleasure. Now, I'm stuck in the office every day, just signing papers. It’s not the same. By the way, today is the first broadcast, right?"

Drama Department Head Kim Wonsuk drank some coffee and finally asked the question he had been dying to ask.

"I have sent the tape and double-checked the final edits in the editing room. You don't have to worry."

"Do you think I’m worried? Of course, I trust you to do well."

"Come on, you’re staying late because you're worried."

"Is it that obvious?"

"Yes, very much. You've been quite hysterical lately. Everyone's been walking on eggshells around you. If you had been like this from the start..."

Kim Wonsuk chuckled. They say you should be careful even with falling leaves in your old age.

Kim Wonsuk was a man who adhered to that principle well. He didn’t want to make any enemies, especially since he planned to run a subcontracting company related to the broadcasting station after his retirement.

"Are you going to leave after watching the first broadcast?"

"Yes. If I go home, I can't even turn on the TV properly because of my kids studying for exams. Plus, the upper management is keeping a close eye on this one."

"Is it because of the production cost?"

"Do you have to suck the marrow out of my bones? It's a historical drama, so we can't get PPL, and the cost of building sets alone is enough to make two mini-series. If the ratings don't come out well, you and I will both have to pack our bags. Understand?"

The famous PD grinned.

"So, where will the reward go if the ratings are good?"

Finally, Kim Wonsuk felt the tension in his chest ease.

The famous PD in front of him had been remarkable in the MBS Drama Department since his early days. If not, he wouldn't have quickly climbed from FD to PD, a journey that usually takes over five years.

Moreover, he was a serious and diligent individual. Seeing him smile today made Kim Wonsuk feel reassured.

"Are you confident?"

At Kim Wonsuk's question, the famous PD placed his coffee cup down with a clatter and answered firmly.

"Yes."

A stray cat stretched on top of the earthenware crock. My grandfather, who fed them as a hobby, had turned the garden into a haven for stray cats.

Somehow, my duty was to change the water. I would fetch fresh water every morning and evening and place it in one corner of the garden.

"Speckles, stop eating so much. Why are you eating so much at night?"

This one had quite an appetite. It gobbled up the food as if someone might take it away. Anyone would think it was starving. Yet, it ate three meals a day in my grandfather's yard. Anyway,

The living room of the mansion was already filled with my uncle and actor Kim Hyungseop. The reason was simple. They had gathered to watch the historical drama "Yeonsan, The Secret of the King," which would air soon.

"Youngguk, bring some more popcorn."

"Uncle, do you think this is a movie theater?"

"You brat, all these seniors have gathered to watch your historical drama. Get some beers too."

My uncle had a knack for teasing me. My grandfather just smiled kindly, and actor Kim Hyungseop, pretending to hesitate, asked.

"By the way, does Youngguk appear in today's episode?"

"He's the lead, of course he does."

"But isn't it a historical drama? Won't it start with child actors?"

As I set down the tray with beer cans and a plate of popcorn, I answered their curiosity.

"I'm in the intro."

By the way, actor Kim Hyungseop, like my uncle, had started frequenting my grandfather's mansion. His friendly demeanor seemed to make my grandfather welcome him. The once quiet mansion had become lively, and I didn't mind it.

Soon, we all gathered and chatted as we waited. When "Yeonsan, The Secret of the King" started on the TV, everyone fell silent.

The drama began with intensity.

It was the coronation ceremony of Yi Yong, who wore the royal crown.

In the Injeongjeon (Hall of Benevolent Governance), where the officials stood on both sides, the crown prince, dressed in royal robes, walked toward the throne with the crown princess.

An unreadable smile appeared on the face of the crown prince, Yi Yong, as he walked toward the throne.

As the ceremony proceeded to the music played by the court musicians, the officials chanted "Cheoncheonse" (Long live the king).

To symbolize the change of heavens, an unknown bird chirped and circled the sky. The screen transitioned following the bird's flight.

-Moo.

The scene shifted to a butcher chanting Buddhist scriptures while placing a ghost mask on a dying cow. The butcher, with bloodstains on his wild hair, held a large axe.

He looked at the sky through the old roof of the slaughterhouse, known as Cheongung.

In the beam of light, the face of the butcher mirrored that of the crown prince walking toward the throne.
