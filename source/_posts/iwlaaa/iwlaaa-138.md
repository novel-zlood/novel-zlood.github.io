Villain.

An actor's image is directly linked to their roles.

Undoubtedly, once an image is overlaid, it's not easy to shed it.

For instance, take Macaulay Culkin from 'Home Alone.' The role he took on as a child actor defined his image for life. Therefore, actors are wary of their image becoming fixed. However...

"Youngguk, you're definitely taking this role, right?"

Manager Lee Bongchun's voice is filled with concern as he grips the steering wheel.

An image transformation for an actor is a significant task. But in the case of a drastic transformation, there's a high probability of it backfiring. It's only natural that the manager is this worried.

"Hyung, it sounds like you don't want me to take it."

"The character seems too arrogant."

The role is a villain with a reckless and insolent personality. This isn't Youngguk's first transformation. From being the nation's first love to a priest and even a Casanova.

Despite being praised for having a wide range of roles at a young age, Youngguk's public image is closer to that of a model citizen.

Not just in terms of acting, but also in scoring perfect marks on the college entrance exam and getting into the law department at Korea University.

"Actually, the CEO seems to be uncertain too. After reading the script, I understood why the CEO is worried. The character is completely different from your usual image, Youngguk. Swearing is just the beginning; it's a pretty rough character. Well, I trust you've thought it through and made your decision."

Youngguk shows a faint smile. It's a concern he hasn't heard in his past life.

No one ever criticized the roles he took. Due to his somewhat grim appearance, it was natural for him to take on roles like thugs or criminals.

Only after his acting skills were recognized did the diversity of his roles increase, but before that, he was a minor role specialist in gangster films.

"Hyung, I think I'll fit the villain role better than you think."

Just then, their van arrives at the Baek Janghoon Production building. Youngguk leaves the script behind and steps out of the car. It's the audition day for the movie "Outlaw."

It's not an open audition; the production contacted only the actors whose profiles passed the initial screening.

As he steps into the building, the receptionist who recognizes Youngguk's face guides him.

"Actor Jang Youngguk, you're here for the audition, right?"

This receptionist had once failed to recognize Youngguk. He gives her a gentle smile.

She guides him to a meeting room.

"There are other actors waiting here as well."

Just when he wonders if it's not an individual audition, he opens the door and sees familiar faces.

‘Kim Hyuk, Bae Jungwoo, and Lee Seojun... wow.’

It's rare for renowned actors, especially those in the top tier of Chungmuro, to show up at an audition site.

As Youngguk appears, some actors glance at him. But it doesn't last long.

Some even turn their heads away, refusing to exchange greetings with juniors and seniors.

Of course, there's no such thing as second place in an audition. Only one person can be chosen for one role. The clear tension of a competitive battle begins. Just then...

"Youngguk-ssi!"

He turns his head at the familiar voice.

"Hwawon hyung?"

* * *

If there were a country dog, would it look like this? Not to imply rustic; rather, his skin is more refined than most actresses.

Hwawon smiles brightly at Youngguk.

"To meet here!"

"Hyung, you're here for the audition too? Weren't you in the middle of shooting a drama?"

"The crank-in is after the drama shooting ends, so I asked the PD. Of course, there's no guarantee I'll get the role."

Son Hwawon speaks in a whisper, perhaps conscious of the surrounding actors. It was common for actors to audition even during shooting periods.

While scripts flood into famous actors' agencies, those less known might not even get short synopses.

"Hyung, I asked you to speak comfortably last time."

"Oh, right. I'll speak casually from now on. Youngguk, is this how Director Baek Janghoon's auditions are usually conducted?"

Son Hwawon awkwardly asks in informal speech. It must seem strange to him too. After all, the actors waiting for the audition at Baek Janghoon Production are a notable lineup.

All are actors whose names are familiar in Chungmuro and the broadcasting world. Even Son Hwawon himself had rapidly risen as Chungmuro's blue chip.

"I didn't expect this many famous people to gather. Kim Hyuk sunbae-nim is here too, but everyone seems too tense to even greet."

"It's not because they dislike you, Youngguk. I also tried to greet them when I first arrived, but everyone was too tense. It shows how sharp they are. By the way, Youngguk, are you auditioning for the lead role too?"

"No, I'm auditioning for a supporting role."

"Supporting role?"

Son Hwawon's eyes widen at the mention of a supporting role.

"You know the character, Jung Haesuk, the second-generation chaebol? I'm aiming for that role."

At that moment, an actor sitting in one corner of the meeting room with his legs crossed sharpens his gaze.

* * *

It feels like walking on thin ice. An actor's audition is always a series of tensions.

But throughout his life, hasn't he already reached middle age?

He's attended countless auditions, but this one is exceptionally nerve-wracking.

‘Gathering all the actors?’

An actor's gaze differs from that of the audience. They scrutinize each other's performances, noticing any flaws immediately.

That's the current situation. Actors watching each other's performances with a faint smirk.

‘Even Kim Hyuk applied?’

He's known for his high fees. Famous for not appearing unless he's the lead or his co-star's fee is higher than his.

Such an actor applied for a supporting role. And a villain at that.

"Thank you for your effort."

Director Baek Janghoon raises his hand. The actor who was performing looks deflated and bows his head. Naturally, this audition was more nerve-wracking than most filming sites.

Even the presence of Director Baek Janghoon alone would be overwhelming, but having Chungmuro's top actors watching and waiting their turn was nerve-wracking. Only a master could conduct such an audition.

"Actor Kim Hyuk."

An actor who has traversed both television and cinema, reaching the peak of his career. His face shows no signs of tension.

"Scene 34."

With a brief command, Kim Hyuk's performance begins. Unlike his polite greeting earlier, he immediately adopts an arrogant expression.

Then he roughly shoves both hands into his pockets.

Watching another's audition up close is rarely easy.

Especially when it's a famous actor. Not only Youngguk but all the actors in the room watch him.

"Do you know what my father's biggest mistake of his life was?"

Kim Hyuk scoffs.

"Letting you off so easily. If it weren't for his old-fashioned kindness, you'd have been beaten up like a dog trying to bite its owner. You think you're something with that prosecutor badge? In the grand scheme of the Hyesung Group, you're just a cog. Got it?"

As his performance continues, the audience's attention sharpens. Kim Hyuk's acting shines even brighter compared to the previous actor. Just then...

Step.

Kim Hyuk suddenly walks towards Youngguk. He gets right in his face and glares at him.

"No matter how much you struggle, you'll always be beneath me, you bastard."

Director Baek Janghoon raises his hand. The scene has ended. It seems Kim Hyuk used him for the continuation of his performance.

At that moment, Kim Hyuk steps on Youngguk's foot unnoticed. He almost lets out a groan but holds it in. Kim Hyuk smirks and returns to his seat.

Is this guy crazy?

After pondering, Youngguk realizes why Kim Hyuk acted that way. Out of all the actors, he chose Youngguk as his counterpart, and after the performance, he secretly stepped on his foot.

‘Why show such hostility?’

Kim Hyuk once commanded the highest fees for dramas. His prominence in "Love of the Sun" was a hot topic. But Youngguk's appearance in the MBS special historical drama broke that record. His pride must have been hurt.

"Actor Jang Youngguk."

Director Baek Janghoon calls, and Youngguk stands up.

‘He's quite petty.’

Even now, Kim Hyuk watches him with a sneer.

Youngguk ignores Kim Hyuk's mocking gaze, focusing only on the present moment.

Opposite him at the judges' table sit Director Baek Janghoon, a cinematographer, and writer Go Gwangtae.

"Scene 34."

Huh?

It's the same scene Kim Hyuk just performed.

Kim Hyuk's blatant gaze is palpable. Still sneering, he seems to be waiting to see how well Youngguk performs. The other actors are the same.

‘This is more pressure than any stage.’

It's not because of the Chungmuro actors. It's because of Director Baek Janghoon sitting at the judges' table. The kindly grandfather-like eyes are now sharp.

Youngguk quietly controls his breathing and closes his eyes. How much time has passed? It was only a fleeting moment.

But when Youngguk reopens his eyes slightly...

"Fuck."

He has become another person. His crooked smile and every tiny muscle in his face twist into a mocking expression.

He stretches his neck side to side, spewing curses, a side of Youngguk never seen before.

Even his gleaming eyes seem ready to devour someone.

"Do you know what my father's biggest mistake of his life was?"

His tone is different, adjusting the intensity of his lines.

"Letting you off so easily. If it weren't for his old-fashioned kindness..."

A laugh escapes at the end of his line. Moments ago, his eyes were menacing, but now there's an inexplicable smile. But look closely, and you'll see.

He's speaking with every bit of suppressed anger, his lips trembling slightly, indicating his rage.

Just then...

Step.

He suddenly starts walking. Not his usual steps, but bold strides suggesting no one can stop him.

He scrutinizes the actors watching him.

Then, with his long fingers, he touches someone's chin. His left hand clenches as if holding something.
