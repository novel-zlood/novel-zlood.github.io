Throughout the winter, the hibernating frog peeks its head out. Even the paddy ridges buried in the harsh winter snow are now filled with lush green barley.

The seeds scattered in the field last night have already grown enough to raise flower stalks, adding to the greenery.

After only seeing the majestic and solemn palace ridge, facing this wide-open freshness makes my heart flutter.

“Director Yoo, I prefer filming in the barley fields over the grand palace. It brings back childhood memories, and seeing those frogs hopping around makes my mouth water... Every time I come to a paddy ridge filled with barley, it strangely smells like potatoes.”

“Potatoes?”

“After harvesting the barley, we used to burn the barley straw. When I was a kid, we would secretly steal potatoes, throw them into the burning straw, and roast them. Watching the burning barley straw in the field, taking a big bite of a potato, and coming home late, I'd get scolded by my mom. My whole body would be covered in soot. It's a memory I can't go back to now.”

Director Kim Deukhyeong reminisces about the past while facing the open field.

Even if I can't fully empathize with his childhood, looking at the end of the green barley waves gives me a faint understanding.

Famous PD turns his head slightly, smiling. There, a young man stands idly facing the barley field.

With a hat on, the way his coat flutters clearly indicates he's a nobleman, even from a distance, his attire is elegant.

Just then, the famous PD approaches Youngguk with a warm cup of coffee and says,

“Youngguk, why are you so lost in thought?”

“Just thinking about the old days. My mother used to mash sweet potatoes into barley rice. Back then, it looked so much tastier than white rice that I cried because only mom got to eat the good stuff. Looking back, it was because we didn't have rice at home... Am I being too sentimental?”

“Sentimental, indeed.”

“By the way, who are those people over there? They don't seem to be extras.”

At Youngguk's question, the famous PD rubs his nose and answers,

“Lately, we've been getting so many calls from the drama department. From media outlets to various platforms, everyone wants to cover the filming site. It seems everyone wants a piece of the pie. But the opportunity went to our entertainment news.”

In the end, the saying "the arm bends inward" holds true. After all, the drama 'Yeonsan, The King's Secret' has been increasing in viewership with each episode. Since passing the mid-point, the ratings surpassed 36.8%, so no wonder.

With so much public interest, there are many media outlets wanting to cover it. At that moment, a frog jumps past their feet.

“You know there are a lot of frogs at today's filming location, right?”

“Of course. As soon as we arrived, the frog croaks were so loud that I thought we came to a frog field, not a barley field.”

“That's what I'm worried about. Actress Cha really hates frogs; she doesn't even want to come out of the car because of her amphibian phobia. She said it started after her father made her eat frog legs for health when she was young.”

Youngguk turns his head. Just as the famous PD said, actress Cha Hyejin's car stands still with no sign of the door opening.

No wonder she hasn't moved from the car during standby.

“How long does she plan to stay in the car?”

“Oh, she's in the middle of an interview. Since she won't come out, the reporter went inside.”

Good grief.

Suddenly, the car Cha Hyejin is in starts shaking.

What's going on, is she dancing inside?

The famous PD continues, looking out at the field.

“If a frog appears during filming, can you discreetly get rid of it? Don’t improvise like last time.”

“What improv?”

“Remember when you threw a mackerel at actor Park during the Jagalchi Market shoot? I'm warning you in advance because Cha might retaliate for that unscripted move.”

The frog croaks loudly, as if aware they're being discussed. Youngguk's eyes narrow curiously as he looks out at the open field.

* * *

Inside the car, actress Cha Hyejin's brow is furrowed. Her discomfort is evident.

The reason was simple. The filming location was a chilly field filled with frogs she despised.

“Hyejin, are you okay?”

A reporter's voice snaps her out of her reverie. She suddenly realizes she's facing a reporter from entertainment news.

“The yellow skirt and embroidered top suit you so well. I don't know if I should say this, but you truly embody the essence of the Joseon era's top courtesan.”

“Oh, thank you.”

“Taking on the role of Jang Nok-su has garnered a lot of public interest. People were curious if you and rising star Jang Youngguk would have good chemistry. How do you feel about working with him?”

Jang Youngguk?

Cha Hyejin glances out the car window at actor Jang Youngguk.

She had to admit he acted well for his age. She also remembered getting scolded for trying to improvise with him once. But that was all.

“As an actor, Youngguk is excellent. Though he's my 'junior,' there's much to learn from him as a performer.”

“What about personally?”

“Pardon? I haven't contacted him personally, so I wouldn't know.”

“Oh, come on. When young men and women in their twenties gather, feelings can develop.”

“He feels more like a younger brother than anything else.”

“Younger brother?”

The reporter's eyes widen. No wonder, since Jang Youngguk is currently the most sought-after male actor among actresses in the industry.

Despite his young age, he has the physique of an athlete. Moreover, his acting skills are exceptional for his age.

“He just feels like a big younger brother to me.”

That's not true. Sometimes, Cha Hyejin felt intimidated by Youngguk. Although he was younger and had less experience, facing him felt like confronting a senior.

Perhaps to alleviate that discomfort, she consciously kept her distance from him.

“In a way, you could say you're completely immersed in the role of Jang Nok-su. Historically, Jang Nok-su treated King Yeonsan like a child.”

It's like interpreting a dream; the reporter is talented.

“That's not entirely wrong.”

“Any memorable episodes while filming? Like something that happened with Youngguk?”

The reporter is eager to bring up stories related to Youngguk. After all, he's the most talked-about actor in the industry right now. Although Cha Hyejin is a renowned actress in Korea, she can't match Youngguk's current popularity.

After all, he won the Blue Dragon Film Award for Best Actor, scored a perfect SAT, and got into Korea University's Law School—all impressive achievements even if done one by one, but he did all three in succession.

Moreover, as the historical drama 'Yeonsan, The King's Secret' surpassed 36.8% in ratings, his popularity soared even higher.

“Episodes while filming…”

Cha Hyejin tried to think of ways to tease Youngguk but couldn't recall any significant episodes. After filming, they would just part ways with a 'good job' and that was it.

It's odd considering most male actors she worked with had personal feelings for her.

‘Could it be that I'm not attractive enough?’

Cha Hyejin glances out the car window at Youngguk.

But Youngguk seems unaware, still talking with the famous PD. Just then—

“Huh, how did a frog get in here?”

The reporter looks puzzled, staring at the car floor. Cha Hyejin hurriedly lifts her legs. She hated frogs so much that she had the interview inside the car, yet a frog had somehow gotten in.

“Get it out, quickly!”

Cha Hyejin's panic makes the car shake as if there's an earthquake.

* * *

“Scene number 57, Yi-yong and Jang Nok-su in the barley field—!”

Like a hawk watching a fish in the spring sky, the camera angle descends from above, zooming in on two people walking through the barley field path.

“Your Highness, you are unusually silent today.”

King Yeonsan Yi-yong gives a bitter smile.

By now, his twin would be sitting on the throne in the palace. To avoid the ministers' eyes, didn't he hide in this vast barley field?

It's a lie to say he's not worried if his brother can manage well during this short yet long week.

“Nok-su, aren't you curious how I can leave the court for so long?”

“I only wish for Your Majesty's well-being and have no interest in other matters.”

“Even the passing grass is so peaceful. Why is the court always so sharp? If everyone had a peaceful heart like you, Nok-su, there would be no turmoil.”

Actress Cha Hyejin, playing Jang Nok-su, smiles demurely.

King Yeonsan Yi-yong walks through the open field, facing the rising spring sun. Of course, from a distance, Captain Kim Hoin follows.

“Blue barley is as beautiful as a natural wonder. If I could drink here, even spirits would envy me. But since my body is weak and I can't drink, I'll comfort myself with music. Nok-su, would you dance for me?”

“If it is Your Majesty's command, I would dance even on a frozen river.”

King Yeonsan Yi-yong picks a blade of grass from the path. It reminds him of a distant childhood memory. Didn't his mother pluck grass from the stone wall of Changdeok Palace and play the flute for him?

He places the grass between his lips and blows, the tune of old longing resonating over the barley field.

The sound of grasshoppers rustling through the barley stems and frogs croaking from waking up from winter sleep blends together.

Amidst this, Jang Nok-su dances gracefully, her yellow skirt fluttering. Then—

Plop.

A frog jumps onto the skirt of dancing Jang Nok-su. The famous PD, watching through the monitor, widens his eyes and looks at the filming site.

Sure enough, actress Cha Hyejin, playing Jang Nok-su, looks terrified.

‘Should I cut?’

It was supposed to be a one-take scene, capturing a serene spring day of Jang Nok-su and King Yeonsan.

But with the unexpected guest, Jang Nok-su's expression was disrupted. Should he cut the scene? He was in a dilemma.

But at that moment—

“Nok-su, why did you stop dancing?”

Youngguk, playing King Yeonsan Yi-yong, approaches the frozen Jang Nok-su. He bends down and gently cups the frog in his hands.

Like it's finding its home, the frog slips into Youngguk's grasp. King Yeonsan Yi-yong casually releases the frog back into the barley field, adding,

“Perhaps the frog mistook you for a blooming canola flower. Even without a scent, you're so beautiful that it's understandable.”
