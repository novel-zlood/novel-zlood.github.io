The last episode of "Yeonsan, The King's Secret" is being aired through the small TV screen.

The feeling is quite different from when monitoring on the filming set. Youngguk's mother watches her son's passionate performance with teary eyes.

- With the new king ascending the throne, you too must walk a difficult path. If the edge of the court's sword does not reach you today, I can at least save face with my brother. Gyeomsabokjang, may I ask you one last favor?

Just as a shell breaks and reveals the kernel, Lee Gyeol in the TV screen is no different. He has taken off the royal robe and returned to his original self.

The regret and remorse hidden in his monotonous voice make the listeners' hearts ache.

- After I die, cut a strand of my hair and bury it next to my brother.

Lee Gyeol's figure, collapsing while coughing up blood, is clearly seen against the brilliant sunlight.

Gyeomsabokjang, having thrown off his hat, bursts into tears and hugs the cold, lifeless body of the king with trembling hands.

The screen fades to black as it zooms in on a daisy swaying as if nothing had happened.

- According to the records, it is said that Yeonsangun died suddenly two months after being exiled. No one knew that his hair was buried together with his brother's grave.

After the drama ends, four people walk together.

The scene of Namhang Market, devoid of tourists and merchants, is utterly quiet. Instead of the bustling noise of tourists and the strong dialect of Busan ajummas, only the sound of waves hitting the breakwater can be heard.

"Oppaya, you act so well! When the ajumma cried, I cried too. The more I watch, the more amazed I am."

"What's so amazing?"

"Our theater club teacher said that acting can't be learned overnight. Even if you have talent, you need a lot of effort to make it bloom. So I asked, isn't there anyone who's good from the start? The teacher firmly said no. But you, oppa, seem like you were good at acting from the start."

Youngguk recalls the word "easy-going" as he thinks of Jisoo. The girl, Jisoo, quickly became close to Youngguk. If a stranger saw them, they might even think they were siblings.

"There's no such thing as someone good at acting from the start. Everyone has to work hard."

"Really? But you were scouted on the streets and appeared in dramas from a young age. Even now, look. The Yeonsangun you showed in the drama is completely different from how you talk to me now. Are you a robot or something? Like one that transforms with the push of a button."

Youngguk smiled faintly. If it weren't for his past experiences, he wouldn't be able to act like he does now.

He remembered struggling with hunger after moving to Seoul and taking on minor roles. All those past memories he wanted to forget have come together to create the Youngguk of today.

At that moment, Jisoo nudged Youngguk's side and gestured ahead with her head. There, they saw two people walking ahead of them.

"Oppaya, don't hate my dad too much."

"What?"

"He's usually very shy and reserved, but he's gotten much better since coming to Namhang Market. If I hadn't approached the ajumma first, he wouldn't have had the courage to do so. He's not very good at business either, so if it weren't for me, he would have closed the store a long time ago. At first, when he said he was quitting his job and moving to Yeongdo to open a side dish store, I wondered how long it would last. But look. Because there's something he wants to protect, he works so hard."

"..."

"My dad is a man too."

Youngguk saw his past self in Jisoo. In some ways, she seemed more remarkable than his past self. At that moment, his mother, who was walking ahead, turned around and shouted.

"Why are you two so late? Hurry up!"

"Oppaya, let's go!"

Jisoo grabbed Youngguk's hand and started running. Caught off guard, he held her hand, but seeing Jisoo's innocent smile made him smile too.

The two adults smiled as they watched the children run towards them. The stars in the night sky combined with the streetlights to softly illuminate them.

In the alley past Yeongdo Bridge, which raises and lowers, fortune tellers have lived since the past.

After the Korean War, refugees who had nowhere else to turn would visit these fortune tellers as a last resort.

The most famous fortune teller among them was none other than the old lady Yeongdo Bear.

The smell of savory soybean paste stew wafted from the small shrine in her house.

"Hey, what are you doing? I made breakfast."

"Grandma, I couldn't just sit back and watch you have only scorched rice water every morning. Your grandson is here for the first time in a while, so I should at least make breakfast."

"My stomach isn't well, so I only drink scorched rice water. It's too much trouble..."

Despite her words, the old lady Yeongdo Bear greeted the breakfast prepared by her grandson with a smiling face. The savory soybean paste stew and crunchy stuffed cucumbers whet the appetite.

At that moment, Bongchun glanced at the shrine and asked.

"Grandma, why don't you stop working and come live with me in Seoul? My parents are busy with the market and can't take good care of you."

"No need. Do you think you can take good care of me if I go to Seoul? I've lived my whole life as a fortune teller here. How would I live in Seoul? Don't you need to go to Jagalchi?"

"Even if I go, all I'll do is catch hagfish. I came down quietly to take a good rest during my vacation, so it's fine. By the way, I've always been curious about something."

"What is it?"

"Why don't you read your only grandson's fortune? You're the best fortune teller in Yeongdo after all."

The old lady Yeongdo Bear furrowed her brows and replied.

"Family members' fortunes are not supposed to be read. Even if I try to read it, it's like being shrouded in fog, and I can't see clearly. There's too much emotion involved, so I can't read it properly. How can I give a proper fortune reading when I can't see clearly? What if something bad happens? Whether it's good or bad, it's best not to say anything!"

"Got it. No need to be so scary."

Bongchun brought warm tea to his grandmother, who had finished her meal.

"By the way, grandma, how was the last episode of the drama yesterday? We watched it together."

"That young fellow acted well. It was worth watching."

"Youngguk has a good fortune, right? He's tall and handsome, so his future should be bright. I take care of him, and he's so polite and smart that sometimes he seems like my older brother."

"Interesting."

The old lady Yeongdo Bear sipped her tea and continued.

"His broad shoulders and sturdy build are perfect for an actor. His lips are shiny like a maiden's, which is ideal for an actor. His career palace is impeccable, and he's very resourceful. And his eyes, they're like jade stones, showing the potential of a dragon holding a wish-fulfilling jewel. But..."

"...?"

"The more I look at his face, the more it seems like there's something hidden, but I can't figure out what it is. I feel like I would know if I saw his full fortune. Tell him to come for a reading someday. I won't do it for free."

"Then what about the actress who played Jang Nok-su?"

"The actress? Are you talking about the one who played Jang Nok-su? She has a face that should be like a swan flapping its wings on the water, but her fate is very different."

"What do you mean?"

"It means the swan might not be able to fly. She thinks she's standing in water, but she's actually in mud. I only saw her on TV, though."

The old lady Yeongdo Bear put down her teacup with a sound and added.

"How pitiful."

As the fishing boats docked and the seagulls played along the wharf, unexpected drizzle began to fall.

The fish market at dawn was more bustling than ever.

Amidst the constant haggling between the auctioneers and the intermediate wholesalers, a cat sneaked in to avoid the raindrops, hoping a fish might fall out of a crate.

"Don't you know it's worse to have bad quality than missing a few fish? I can't yield today!"

"Why are you like this, Mr. Park? I was here first and marked it. If you wanted good quality, you should have come quickly!"

"Five minutes early and you're boasting. We won the bid together! And the auctioneer couldn't even see my hand because you pushed with your big body. It should all be mine! I'm not leaving today!"

The intermediate wholesalers argued over the fish they won at the auction. Even the same fish could vary in quality, leading to high tensions.

If someone from the metropolitan area saw this scene, they might close their eyes tightly. It looked like a fight could break out at any moment.

But no one in the fish market paid any attention to them. It was just another ordinary day.

"You guys are still the same! Your loud voices are affecting the other auctions!"

At that moment, a young man stepped forward. Mr. Park squinted his eyes and recognized the young man's face under the cap.

"Youngguk!"

"What, Youngguk is here!"

"Enough greetings. These goods need to be moved quickly. You've argued enough. Let's settle this with rock-paper-scissors or drawing lots!"

"If it's Youngguk's word, we have to listen. Fine. Park, you're lucky."

"You're one to talk!"

Having grown up frequenting the fish market, Youngguk was familiar with the intermediate wholesalers rooted in Yeongdo. After mediating the two men's complex squabble, he noticed the stares.

Not only were the intermediate wholesalers and auctioneers paying attention but also the tourists visiting the market.

Youngguk quietly slipped away.

"Who is that! Isn't that Youngguk!"

As he entered the rest area for auctioneers, one of them who was making instant coffee greeted him warmly.

"When did you come down? What brings you to the fish market in the morning!"

"I just wanted to visit. This place hasn't changed at all."

"Nothing's changed, huh. It's not as lively without you."

"But the auctioneers' songs and the wholesalers' loud voices are still noisy."

"That's like the sound of waves at the seaside. Here, have a cup of coffee."

"I could make it myself."

"It's fine. It's already made. Do you remember back in the day? You fought a lot over fish. I've never seen anyone try to impress the auctioneers like you."

Youngguk accepted the paper cup handed to him by the easygoing auctioneer. It was just instant coffee, but it smelled richer than any coffee from a café in Seoul.

As he sipped his coffee, he noticed the morning newspaper in the auctioneer's hand.

"Mister, can I see the newspaper for a moment?"

"Sure, take your time. I can read it after the auction."

Youngguk put down the paper cup and read the morning newspaper. He couldn't help but be taken aback by the headline.

[Actress Cha Hyejin Exposes Sexual Bribery Scandal of BS Entertainment CEO Yang Sugap!]

'Wow.'

He recalled the words he had said to actress Cha Hyejin in the past.

There were only two ways out of that situation, he had said.

Either continue being dragged along like that, or...

"She really went all in."
