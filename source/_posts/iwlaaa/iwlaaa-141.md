Aura.

Actors typically change their demeanor depending on the roles they take on. Even before the method technique was established, famous actors often synchronized their inner selves with the characters in the script.

For example, an actor playing the role of a murderer might change their walking style, speech, and even thoughts to resemble a real murderer, even off set.

The case of Hollywood actor Marlon Brando is representative. Known as a pioneer of method acting, he often behaved as if he were the character in the script when he took on a role.

A famous anecdote is that during the filming of "The Godfather," some Italian mafia members misunderstood Marlon Brando's behavior and came to the set to cause trouble, only to back down after bowing their heads. Much like now.

"I'm, I'm sorry!"

The staff who spilled water on Youngguk's face turned pale. The character Jung Haeseok in "Outlaw" is hysterical and arrogant.

His unpredictable personality, much like London's weather, makes people tense up when they encounter him.

Perhaps because of this, the staff on the set often found Youngguk difficult to approach.

Those who had been with the Baek Janghoon team for a long time knew Youngguk's true character since he appeared as a cameo when he was young, but new recruits, who hadn't been around long, were scared by the character Jung Haeseok's personality in the script.

When Youngguk raised his hand, the staff member tightly closed their eyes. If it were Jung Haeseok, he would surely slap them without hesitation. But instead,

"Are you okay?"

He calmed the trembling staff member, placing a reassuring hand on their shoulder. Youngguk's eyes were filled with concern as he looked at the staff member.

He had no choice but to ask for a glass of water while getting his hair styled.

"You're not hurt, are you?"

The staff member hiccuped and nodded repeatedly. Youngguk didn't stop there and raised his hand to feel their forehead, worried they might have caught a cold.

"What about your clothes?"

"It's okay, I needed to change anyway. Besides, it's hot, so it's refreshing."

"I'm, I'm really sorry—!"

Youngguk's joke seemed to be taken as sarcasm. After getting his hair styled, the junior staff member, who had been bowing repeatedly, left. Someone who had been watching the entire situation approached.

"Wow, Jang Youngguk, you really have a strong presence."

Son Hwawon clapped his hands and gave a thumbs-up.

"Do you know that the staff on set are more wary of you than the director these days?"

This was news to him. Although his role had a sharp personality, he had never thrown a tantrum on set, even though he spoke less than usual.

As if reading Youngguk's thoughts, Son Hwawon added,

"I knew you didn't know. The staff who don't know you think your real personality is just like Jung Haeseok."

"That's ridiculous."

"That's the problem with being too good at acting. Even I get scared or surprised sometimes when I see you act on set. People who don't know you might think you're naturally playing the role so smoothly because you're like that in real life."

"Hyung, you're no different. Ever since you took on the role of Lee Howon, you've been just as sly as the character."

It was true. Considering Son Hwawon's normally introverted nature, it was an unimaginable transformation. Just then, Son Hwawon, hesitatingly, said,

"That's only because I'm comfortable with you, Youngguk..."

Wait,

Why are you scratching the floor with your finger?

"Scene number 31, the meeting of Jung Haeseok and Lee Howon!"

Judicial Research and Training Institute. A place where the best talents from all over the country gather. The faces of those who passed the bar exam, known to be the hardest in Korea, are diverse.

Some had followed an elite course from a young age, passing on their first attempt with a brilliant mind, while others, known as 'gosinangin,' passed after countless years of uncertainty and waiting.

"Lee Howon, would you like to become a scholar?"

A secret proposal and a figurative expression.

Without even having time to think, Lee Howon responded to the old professor's question.

The reason he had passed the bar exam and aimed to become a legal professional was not to uphold the law for society but solely for his own success.

That's why he had endured the harsh life in a goshiwon, clutching his law books as he slept.

After passing the probationary period, and the two-year training at the Judicial Research and Training Institute,

The new legal professionals would now take different paths, some becoming judges, others prosecutors, and some lawyers.

However, those gathered here were all the same in one respect. They were all scholars of the Jeongil Group.

'They call us scholars.'

In other words,

'We're nothing more than servants.'

A man entered the restaurant where the new legal professionals were gathered.

The bustling room fell silent as if a Judicial Research and Training Institute director had entered, filling the air with tension.

The man naturally took the seat of honor.

Adorned with expensive luxury items, his actions were reminiscent of a mogul, despite his young appearance.

Everyone in the room knew who he was. He was Jung Haeseok, the heir of Jeongil Group, who held their fates in his hands.

"How tasteless, eating this stuff."

Though it was the most famous restaurant in Cheongdam, it didn't suit his taste. When he threw his chopsticks onto the table, tension surged once more.

Jung Haeseok leaned forward and scanned the faces of the legal professionals with interest.

"Chicks, you guys are the new scholars, right?"

Though they were new judges, prosecutors, and lawyers who had just graduated from the Judicial Research and Training Institute, they were still legal professionals. Being called 'chicks' by Jung Haeseok made everyone swallow their pride.

No one expressed their frustration. It was akin to a servant not showing their emotions to their master.

"All of you became scholars to climb the Jeongil Group ladder, didn't you? Why isn't anyone answering? Do you think I have time to waste here? I'll ask one last time. Are you Jeongil Group's scholars or not?"

At that moment,

"Yes, we are—!"

A loud voice echoed. Jung Haeseok looked at him with interest. He was a legal professional with pale skin like a scholar. Following his shout, other legal professionals echoed the same.

The reason these high-nosed legal professionals wanted to become Jeongil Group scholars was clear without any complex legal interpretations.

Even elementary school kids could understand. It was to grab power and success.

At that moment, Jung Haeseok stood up with a bottle of alcohol.

"Take a drink, chick. What's your name?"

"I am Lee Howon, newly appointed to the Western Prosecutors' Office."

"Oh, you're the top student? Amusing. Most aim to become judges, but you're a prosecutor."

He poured alcohol into Lee Howon's glass. Though it was already full to the brim, he kept pouring until the liquor overflowed and soaked his thigh.

Despite this, Lee Howon didn't stop holding the glass. Only then did Jung Haeseok put the bottle down and say,

"Drink."

"Thank you!"

Jung Haeseok smirked at his characteristic slyness. Lee Howon drank the full glass in one gulp and bowed his head.

Seeing this, Jung Haeseok addressed the legal professionals.

"You are not servants. You are nothing more than dogs guarding the Jeongil Group mansion. I don't think you'll regret putting on the leash and coming here. If you do, just say the word, and I'll make sure to block your path."

The legal professionals' pupils trembled like an earthquake. Some clenched their fists under the table, holding back their anger.

To Jung Haeseok, they were less than servants.

"Hey chick, what do you think the law is?"

"I believe it is a rule equal to all and based on common sense."

One of the legal professionals answered. It wasn't an answer that pleased him. His eyes sharpened instantly.

He looked straight at Lee Howon.

"You are the ones who should be closest to the law yet furthest from it. The reason is simple. To protect those who stand above the law, known to be equal to all."

Jung Haeseok took off his wristwatch. What was he planning?

"You are not legal professionals. As dogs of Jeongil Group, fulfill your duties, be loyal to your master, wag your tails, and receive expensive treats. If you fail to do so, it's only natural for you to be sold on the day of Boknal. Some might wonder what it means to stand above the law."

At that moment, Jung Haeseok raised his hand. With a sharp sound of wind, his palm ruthlessly struck Lee Howon's face.

* * *

"Hyung, are you okay?"

Son Hwawon was rubbing his cheek with a raw egg. It was so hard he got hit that his cheek turned red like a ripe persimmon.

Youngguk, sitting next to him, looked worried, fearing it might bruise. But Son Hwawon just smiled foolishly as if unaware of his concern.

"I told you during the rehearsal. Tilt your face slightly like when we match the timing. Seriously, who gets slapped straight on like that?"

"I thought it wouldn't look realistic otherwise..."

"Still, what if it bruises?"

"It's okay, the shot turned out well, didn't it?"

Youngguk couldn't deny that. Thanks to Son Hwawon's bold approach, Director Baek Janghoon didn't even call for another take.

Watching the footage, it was evident that he had indeed taken a direct hit.

Son Hwawon, shaking his head at Youngguk's concern, said,

"Actually, Youngguk, I've been really enjoying coming to the set lately."

It was an unexpected remark. Director Baek Janghoon's filming set was notorious for being tough. Especially for Son Hwawon, who had the most retakes, it must have been exhausting.

"I didn't have any friends. I've been acting for a long time since I was a child actor, but looking back, there's no one left by my side. So I was really envious of you, Youngguk. You're around my age but always surrounded by people."

"It wasn't always like that for me either."

"Oh, don't lie. Jungseok hyung said you were amazing even as a child actor. You hear stories in the industry. People who worked with you always praised you. Honestly, I was jealous. How can someone so young act so maturely?"

Youngguk gave a bitter smile. He was the same.

In his past life, he hadn't cared for those around him, focusing solely on his acting career and success.

"Just as a chrysalis transforms into a butterfly, acting is the same. Don't be too tied down by the limits you set for yourself. One day, you'll break through that shell. You're a more valuable actor than the limits you've set. Those words really struck me. Maybe that's why I'm acting here now. It's like living a dream every day. So."

Son Hwawon grasped Youngguk's hand.

"Youngguk, thank you so much for being my friend."

Son Hwawon's eyes glistened like a puppy's. How lonely he must have been. But despite the serious moment, one couldn't help but laugh.

His slapped cheek was swollen red, looking like a squirrel with a mouthful of acorns.

Instead of responding, Youngguk picked up the egg and rubbed it on his cheek.
