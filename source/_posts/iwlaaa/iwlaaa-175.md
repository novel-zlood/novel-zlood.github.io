Making Film.

"Are you talking about pre-promotion?"

There are various types of pre-promotion for dramas. There are methods such as using advertisement boards on buses or subways, or having the cast appear on variety shows right before the main broadcast to promote the drama.

However, the method suggested by the famous deputy director was completely different.

"Let's go with a making film."

A making film refers to a video that records the production process on set.

However, it isn't a method commonly used in the drama scene yet. It's more often used in Chungmuro, where it is usually added as an option when selling limited-edition DVDs.

"Since there are two empty slots (one week) before the main broadcast, let's air two episodes of the making film during that time."

"Deputy Director, did the higher-ups approve this?"

The famous deputy director gave a short nod. Seeing this, Kim Woohyeong exclaimed in surprise.

Indeed, as far as he knew, no Korean drama had ever planned a pre-promotion using a making film.

This was because securing two time slots (one week) on a terrestrial broadcast network required a significant amount of scheduling cost. The network had decided to expand the schedule despite the cost.

"We have a prominent figure like Jang Youngguk. We can't be lazy with the pre-promotion. The higher-ups have significant expectations for 'The Prince of the Mermaid' this time. Since it's a debut work, I didn't intend to put any pressure initially. But since things have gotten this big, Woohyeong, you need to steer this well."

"Of course!"

"Okay, by the way, who will you take for the making film shoot?"

Kim Woohyeong fell into contemplation. It is a video recording the production process on set. He wanted to recruit a skilled PD, but who would assist in a junior's shoot?

It's better to set aside the expectation that seniors would eagerly step forward just because it's a junior's debut work. The broadcasting network, especially the drama department, is a jungle.

Moreover, the production process should not be captured in a mundane way. If it's just an ordinary production video, how would it be different from a documentary?

It needs to be a video that meets and satisfies the viewers' needs. Only then will the promotional effect be excellent.

After some hesitation, Kim Woohyeong finally spoke.

* * *

"What...?"

Jang Wooyeon is a second-year FD in the MBS drama department.

Perhaps because of her petite stature and large dragonfly glasses, or maybe because of her slow personality, her nickname in the drama department was "Jangbeng" (snail). Even now. Her reaction to surprise was also one beat slower, like a snail.

"Me...?!"

"Yes, Jangbeng, no, Jang Wooyeon, I chose you. You take charge of the making film shoot this time. You don't have any current projects anyway."

"Senior, but I'm still the youngest FD, and it takes quite a while just to get used to the site atmosphere. How can I shoot...?"

To put it nicely, Jangbeng, no, Jang Wooyeon, was often scolded by seniors on set for simple reasons.

An FD's role is to handle all the chores on set. From managing the set to prevent ordinary people from approaching just before the shoot to contacting the assistant extras manager and securing extras.

If you were to detail the work of an FD, even all your fingers and toes wouldn't suffice. That's how quickly you need to grasp the situation and have the agility required for the position.

However, Jang Wooyeon, with her lack of experience, found it somewhat challenging to do all this perfectly.

But there was a reason why Kim Woohyeong chose Jang Wooyeon as the making film director.

"Jang Wooyeon, I saw your college graduation project. You originally wanted to go into advertising, right? Your specialty was creating storytelling and producing visual beauty in a short time. You received a lot of love calls from the advertising side after your graduation work."

"That's true, but..."

"Most importantly, you're a huge fan of Jang Youngguk, right?"

Jang Wooyeon showed a startled expression. In fact, she was an executive member of Jang Youngguk's fan club during university but had to put it on hold due to employment.

But how did Kim Woohyeong know about this? As if reading her mind, Kim Woohyeong added.

"You always put Youngguk's face on your book cover by laminating his photo. How could I not know when your ears perk up whenever Youngguk's name is mentioned in the drama department? This time, make use of your skills and show your capabilities. You don't want to stay an FD forever, do you?"

"..."

"Well, are you planning to stay like this forever?"

"No, not at all...!"

"That's a quick response. What are you doing? Move quickly."

"What...?"

At the following words, Jangbeng, no, Jang Wooyeon, stood up faster than ever.

"Aren't you going to meet Jang Youngguk?"

* * *

It was a cliff that seemed to be carved with utmost care by a stonemason. The surface was so smooth that it was hard to believe it was artificial. Blue waves flowed beneath the cliff.

"Oppa, don't I look strange? I feel very awkward."

Yeonsu was wearing a harness, almost like she was about to bungee jump. However, she wasn't actually going to jump off the cliff. The scene of jumping off the cliff was to be shot at a swimming pool and processed with computer graphics.

"It's fine, so don't worry too much and stay calm."

"How can I not worry? It feels like I'm wearing a diaper."

"It's a safety device, so you must wear it. If you slip on the cliff, you'll fall straight down."

"If I fall, you'll come to save me, right? Didn't you jump into the sea alone when we were shooting before?"

"Hey, do you think this is the same as back then? That was just a small hill. This place looks twice as high. There's a safety officer waiting below in case of emergencies, so don't be too scared. By the way, oppa is too scared to save you."

Of course, if he wanted to, he could jump off. The current filming location was also a place that had been a playground in the past.

However, as an adult, one tends to be more cautious than when they were fearless as a child.

Yeonsu turned her head, pouting her lips. She seemed quite upset at the thought that he wouldn't come to save her. By the way,

'Who is she?'

There was a woman roaming the filming site since a while ago. With a petite frame and dragonfly glasses, she was carrying a camera that looked bigger than her head and capturing various scenes.

At that moment, as if reading Yeongguk's gaze, Kim Woohyeong approached and spoke.

"She's in charge of shooting the making film this time."

"Making film?"

"The network decided to air a making film as a pre-promotion. It's my first time filming a making film for pre-promotion, so I'm quite taken aback. I went up to Seoul for this. I didn't expect they would go for a making film. I thought they would only use bus or subway advertisement boards."

It was quite unexpected. In Chungmuro, making films were occasionally produced, but in the drama scene, they were nearly non-existent.

It was only much later that making films for pre-promotion became a common practice in dramas.

He wondered who came up with this idea.

"This is perfect timing. I couldn't introduce her separately since you were in the waiting room the whole time. Hey, PD Jang—!"

Kim Woohyeong intentionally called out to Jang Wooyeon as 'PD Jang.' Initially not realizing she was being called, Jang Wooyeon quickly noticed Kim Woohyeong's gaze and hurriedly approached, still carrying the camera bigger than her head.

"Introduce yourselves. This is PD Jang Wooyeon. And this is the actor Jang Youngguk, as you know!"

"Director, why are you using honorifics? Just call me Youngguk. Nice to meet you, PD Jang Wooyeon."

"It's an honor—!"

Jang Wooyeon couldn't tell if it was a dream or reality. Just yesterday, she was at the Yeouido broadcasting station, and now, seeing Youngguk in person, he looked much more handsome and tall than on screen.

"PD Jang, you will capture me well in the making film, right?"

"I will do my best! I'll pour all my soul into it and make sure to capture it well!"

"PD Jang, your response is unusually quick today."

Ignoring Kim Woohyeong's words,

Jang Wooyeon, who shook hands with Youngguk, wore a look of sheer bliss.

* * *

"Scene number 60, falling off the cliff—!"

The shoot began. Today's focus was on Myeojeong (Yeonsu). Despite being a chaebol heiress, Myeojeong decided to commit suicide for a hidden reason and jumped off the cliff. Lee Soo, the mermaid prince, saves her as she sinks beneath the waves.

Of course, she wouldn't actually jump off the cliff. The scene was to be shot at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the sea, capturing the moment right before the jump.

Yeongguk watched Yeonsu's performance from the side while waiting for his turn to shoot.

"Mom, I miss you."

She was always a woman as upright as bamboo. But Myeojeong's voice, standing at the edge of the cliff, trembled as if she was scared.

Her gaze toward the sea was probably to see the sky reflected in the water.

Tears, still immature, fell from her eyes as if coaxed by her longing for her mother, who had already passed away.

'She seems busy filming.'

Jang Wooyeon, in charge of the making film, was capturing Yeonsu's performance from one side of the set. As promised to Yeongguk, she was putting her all into it.

The filming continued with Myeojeong's (Yeonsu) monologue at the edge of the cliff. Yeongguk prepared for his next shoot while watching her performance. After Yeonsu's scene, he had a scene where he ran to the cliff.

Flap.

From the edge of the cliff, Yeonsu's clothes fluttered in the sea breeze. With the wind's help, the scene was truly artistic.

"I'm sorry."

With those words, Myeojeong (Yeonsu) leaned towards the cliff. Her body tilted towards the sea below.

However, the taut wire attached to her harness held her body up. Though it must have been scary, the safety device made it look not too dangerous.

The director, who had been watching the scene on the monitor, was about to shout 'cut' when it happened.

Bang—!

A sound like a gunshot echoed at the filming site. Kim Woohyeong quickly stood up to assess the situation, and the rest of the staff moved around busily. Some even screamed.

Everything started to happen in slow motion. From the moment Yeonsu leaned towards the edge of the cliff to the buckle on her harness breaking.

The taut wire flew backward in one second.

Yeonsu's trembling pupils were visible in two seconds.

While everyone was stunned by the sudden accident, unable to react.

Jang Wooyeon, who was filming the making film, also gasped in horror at the accident unfolding through her lens.

At that moment, someone ran towards the cliff. Jang Wooyeon gasped again at the sight through her camera lens.

Youngguk had jumped into the sea from the edge of the cliff without a moment's hesitation.
