That Summer.

The filming site during the scorching heat of Small Heat (小暑) was a continuous forced march.

Due to the heat, even just standing still caused large beads of sweat to roll down. The multiple light sources made it feel like this was not Seoul, South Korea but the middle of the Gobi Desert.

“Won’t Son Hwawon collapse at this rate?”

The assistant director looked at the filming site with a worried expression.

There’s a common saying in Chungmuro that the atmosphere on the first day of shooting determines the success or failure of a film.

Therefore, the first day of shooting is always nerve-wracking.

In that sense, the current filming site of Outlaws (無法者) was chillingly cold, quite unlike the summer weather.

“NG.”

Director Baek Janghun raised his hand, signaling for a break. Son Hwawon, who had been at the center of the filming site, was drenched in sweat as if he had just been caught in a heavy downpour.

“Minjeong, how many outfits is this already?”

The youngest member of the costume team cautiously raised three fingers. Son Hwawon had been climbing and descending the steep hill of the goshi village repeatedly.

They had come to a hillside neighborhood on the outskirts of Seoul to capture the rookie days of the main character, who had yet to pass the bar exam.

However, after repeated NGs, he was already on his third outfit, which was fortunately just a shabby tracksuit. If it had been expensive clothing, it would have been a headache.

“Do you think we can finish today?”

The assistant director scratched his head. The filming site, known as Baek Janghun’s troupe, was more united than any other filming team in Chungmuro.

They knew why Director Baek Janghun insisted on reshoots; it was all to capture a slightly better shot.

“I’m sorry!”

Son Hwawon, realizing that the delay in filming was because of him, repeatedly bowed his head, his sweat-soaked hair getting disheveled. The crew, including cinematographer Do Jangwook, waved it off as if it was no big deal.

Director Baek Janghun’s reshoots were a daily occurrence, and since he pursued perfection, no one blamed the actor. Then,

“Hawonie hyung, drink this.”

A hand was placed on Son Hwawon’s shoulder. The anxious look on his face quickly brightened. The voice belonged to none other than Youngguk. The sudden appearance of a cold tea made him forget the heat.

“Youngguk, you don’t have any filming today, do you?”

The cold tea cooled his throat, and then he seemed to remember.

“It’s the first day of shooting, so of course, I had to come. How could a supporting actor miss the start of the lead actor’s filming?”

“Hey, don’t say lead actor. I just got lucky…”

“Come on, don’t be so modest. Have you already forgotten how many actors wanted the role you got? Even the actors we saw at the production meeting were all notable figures in Chungmuro, and you beat them all. Be confident.”

“Hey, lower your voice. What do you mean I beat them all…”

He was still as humble as ever. In terms of acting skills, there were few peers who could match him, yet his confidence seemed to be stuck in his childhood actor days.

“Youngguk, what should I do? It’s already the seventh shoot. I don’t mind being tired, but the cinematographer has to run around like that.”

The steep slope of the hillside neighborhood was particularly inclined, just like the goshi village. They couldn’t set up a track due to the geographical conditions, so the cinematographer had to move manually. Needless to say, the lighting and sound crew had it tough too.

“They’ll understand. It’s not because you’re bad at acting, but because the director wants a better shot.”

Youngguk had long been known as “the million-dollar cameo” under Director Baek Janghun, so he knew how frequent the reshoots were.

Was it because of Youngguk’s response? A naïve smile appeared beneath Son Hwawon’s sweaty hair.

“Yeah, I should work harder for the director who chose me! I can shoot ten times, a hundred times more!”

Son Hwawon clenched his fists, looking like a country dog.

Watching him, Youngguk wondered whether he should tell him that Director Baek Janghun was known for his reshoots, but most of the footage used in the final cut was from the first take.

“Hyungnim, it feels like the world has changed overnight.”

Cinematographer Do Jangwook exclaimed in amazement. Just the other day, they had been filming on the steep hillside of the goshi village.

But today’s filming site was dazzlingly bright.

There were chandeliers more luxurious than those found in an ordinary home, marble floors, and furniture that looked quite expensive at a glance.

Even the paintings on the walls by famous artists were worth the price of an apartment in the suburbs.

“When filming the family gathering scene, pan down to capture the table. It’s important to show the distance from Chairman Wang’s seat, as it sets the tone for the succession plot.”

“Okay, I understand.”

“And the props team, make sure the water glasses of the others are more than half full, but leave only a little in Chairman Wang’s glass to symbolize a dying man.”

“Yes, understood.”

“Jangwook, I’ll remind you again, during Jung Haeseok’s scene, the tension at the table should be as intense as with Chairman Wang. Capture Jung Haeseok’s expression with a big close-up (B/C/U) and the emotional changes of those at the table with a single shot (1/S/BS). Focus on the faint trembling of his hands when he stands up; that’s the key to this shot.”

Director Baek Janghun was a perfectionist who put meaning into everything, from the layout of the filming site to each prop. Some people questioned whether it was necessary to put so much meaning into every scene, arguing that the audience wouldn’t notice or understand such meticulous details.

But Director Baek Janghun stood by his beliefs. He saw the entire process as elevating movies from mere entertainment to art. Meanwhile,

Youngguk was changing his clothes. Though he had appeared in numerous dramas and films, he had never worn such expensive luxury items.

From head to toe, he perfectly embodied the image of a second-generation chaebol. Even the watch on his wrist was worth more than a foreign car.

At that moment, the youngest member of the costume team entered the dressing room.

“What’s the matter?”

Youngguk asked, and the youngest member of the costume team fidgeted with their lips, unable to speak properly. Realizing his reflection in the mirror, Youngguk smiled faintly and said,

“You’re worried, aren’t you?”

Just like in commercials, most of the clothing in film shoots is often sponsored. While cheaper clothes can have multiple backups, expensive luxury items typically have only one set, and the crew is always anxious about damaging them.

“Don’t worry. I’ll be careful not to damage them.”

The youngest member of the costume team, who had been fretting about upsetting the actor, brightened up instantly.

No wonder; some actors intentionally damaged costumes, and some even took sponsored clothes home if they liked them.

The whims of top-tier actors often went beyond the norm.

“If any of the costumes or props like the watch get damaged, please let me know. I might miss something while filming. I’ll compensate for it.”

“Thank you so much!”

The youngest member of the costume team bowed deeply at a ninety-degree angle, expressing their gratitude. Watching her retreating figure, Youngguk smiled.

“Scene number 11, the tension at the dinner table―!”

The filming site was a mansion’s dining table. Various delicacies were spread out on the long table.

At the head of the table sat Chairman Wang of the Jungil Group, Jung Manso, surrounded by the heads of the subsidiaries.

The filming camera panned down to capture the entire table, showing those seated closest to Chairman Wang.

“Hyungnim, is Haesok going to be late again today?”

The person closest to Chairman Wang was Kim Mincheol, the president of Jungil Foods. He was Chairman Wang’s brother-in-law and Jung Haeseok’s uncle.

He continued speaking, his greedy cheeks twitching.

“Knowing today’s meeting includes all the subsidiary heads, how can he be late? Tsk. When will that boy ever grow up?”

Not all subsidiary heads are the same.

Kim Mincheol, the president of Jungil Foods, was practically Jungil Group’s true bone (眞骨). Chairman Wang of Jungil Group was a ruthless man.

He had taken over the group by outmaneuvering his own brothers. But among them, he exceptionally cherished his youngest sister.

As the husband of such a beloved sister, Kim Mincheol could speak confidently even in a meeting of subsidiary heads.

“Oppa, he’s right. There are so many rumors about Haeseok’s wild behavior these days. I’m worried it might damage the company’s image.”

“Honey, why say that in front of Hyungnim? Especially when other executives are present. Hyungnim, I will make sure to guide Haeseok properly. He can’t continue his reckless behavior if he’s to lead the company in the future.”

Chairman Wang smiled enigmatically. Time had aged his once fierce face, adding wrinkles, and his body had grown frail. The liver spots on his hands were a testament to his old age.

At that moment,

“Young master, you’ve arrived.”

The housekeeper’s words turned the atmosphere at the table. The executives, who had been quietly eating, now wore tense expressions.

Jung Haeseok (Youngguk), dressed in a suit, appeared at the long table.

“Haeseok, you’re here? Come, sit down quickly. You should be punctual on a day like today.”

Ignoring his aunt’s words, Jung Haeseok bowed to Chairman Wang at the head of the table.

Then, he moved abruptly. His gaze fixed on the seat occupied by Kim Mincheol (his uncle).

“Why is President Kim sitting here?”

“Huh?”

Kim Mincheol was taken aback by the sudden question. The succession structure of Jungil Group was solid. Chairman Wang had taken over the group even by causing a fraternal feud.

Thus, Chairman Wang had only one son, Jung Haeseok. If Kim Mincheol was the true bone, then Jung Haeseok was undoubtedly the sacred bone (聖骨) of sacred bones.

“Haeseok, how can you speak to your uncle like that?”

His aunt glared at him, but Jung Haeseok responded with a sneer, lifting the corner of his mouth and placing his long finger on his uncle’s shoulder.

“They said today’s meeting was for the subsidiary heads. Naturally, this seat is usually mine, but today President Kim is sitting here.”

“That’s because you were late…”

“Hey, when the owner is away for a while, can the dog sit in the owner’s seat and eat?”

The executives around the table widened their eyes in shock. His aunt also glared at him.

But Chairman Wang, seated at the head, seemed to be enjoying the situation with a knowing look.

“Stand up.”

At Jung Haeseok’s firm words, President Kim Mincheol of Jungil Foods endured the humiliation and stood up. The filming camera captured him standing up.

The slight trembling of his hands showed how humiliated he felt. Then,

“Oh, you really are standing up.”

Jung Haeseok let out a sneer and pressed down on Kim Mincheol’s shoulder again. Then he walked straight to Chairman Wang at the head of the table.

“Father, I had a drink with a buyer today. I’ll head in first.”

Chairman Wang nodded briefly, granting permission. The scene ended, alternating between the retreating figure of Jung Haeseok and the humiliated expression of Kim Mincheol.
