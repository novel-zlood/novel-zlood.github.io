“Have you heard the rumor?”

The lecture hall buzzes like a marketplace.

It was the week after the tempestuous midterms had ended. Although the atmosphere should have been excited for the upcoming festival, the main interest of the students was not the festival.

After all, the festival at Korea University was notoriously the least popular among domestic university festivals.

“Jang Youngguk got first place in Criminal Law.”

“What? I heard he also got first in Real Rights Law. And he’s taking Introduction to Obligations too.”

“Although the professor didn’t publicly announce the rankings for that class, according to a graduate student who graded the exams, Jang Youngguk’s score was overwhelming.”

“Wow.”

The main interest of the students was none other than the midterm rankings. The undergraduates sitting in the lecture hall couldn’t keep their mouths closed.

This was the law department at Korea University, known for attracting the nation’s brightest minds. Among them, the major courses required as much note-taking and study as medical school.

Because of this, in subjects like Real Rights Law or Introduction to Obligations, which were taught by strict professors, there were cases where students had to retake the class.

‘Is he an alien?’

Shin Jaehee thought of one person’s face and couldn’t understand. He was also knowledgeable when it came to studying, but not to the level of Jang Youngguk.

It was understandable, given that it didn’t make sense for a freshman to replace elective courses with major courses from the beginning.

Moreover, getting first place in those classes by outshining senior students was something that seemed like it could only happen in a novel.

“He wouldn’t get first place in the Mock Criminal Trial too, would he?”

“No way. The Mock Criminal Trial is known to be the hardest among the undergraduate major courses. How could a freshman get first place? And Professor Shin Jeonggil is famous for giving stingy grades. And with the unbreakable fortress Jaehee here, do you think it’s possible?”

As the murmurs in the lecture hall penetrated his ears, Shin Jaehee flinched without realizing it. It felt like that unbreakable fortress might crumble.

At that moment, Kim Dongjin spoke with a peculiar expression.

“Jaehee, did you bomb this exam?”

“Mind your own business. What’s more important is how you study rather than your grades. As a law student, try to cultivate your attitude. By the way, Dongjin, it looks like you did well on the exam. You seem pretty relaxed.”

“Well, I’m just glad I didn’t get an academic warning. What happened to the Shin Jaehee who used to care about grades? Thanks to your notes, I was able to get a few questions right, so I’m relieved.”

What a carefree guy.

“Youngguk! Over here! Here!”

At that moment, as Youngguk entered the lecture hall, Kim Dongjin raised his hand high, acknowledging him. Kim Dongjin continued to chatter on behalf of the ever-silent Youngguk.

“Youngguk, is it true that you got first place in the Criminal Law midterm?”

“I was just lucky.”

“Wow, you. I barely avoided an F in that class last year. So how was the Mock Criminal Trial? You took the exam, so you must have a feeling about it.”

Shin Jaehee, who was sitting next to Kim Dongjin, pretended not to care but perked up his ears. However, the answer that followed was still as bland as ever.

“So-so?”

“Look at how relaxed you are! How can you study so well when you must be busy with your acting career? If you have a secret, teach me. If I get an academic warning this semester, I’ll have to pack up and head straight to the countryside.”

“I’m good at memorizing, so I don’t really have any secret techniques.”

“Man, even if memorization is important in law, there are countless things that conflict and need to be understood from a legal perspective. Does that make any sense? And who in our department can’t memorize? Everyone here was a top student in high school. This guy really seems like an alien. Don’t you think so, Jaehee?”

“What I mean...! No, Kim Dongjin, stop talking nonsense and prepare for class. Don’t you know Professor Shin doesn’t take it easy just because midterms are over?”

Shin Jaehee barely suppressed his true feelings and wiped off his cold sweat.

Whether he knew this or not, Youngguk leisurely opened his major textbook. Watching this, Shin Jaehee started to wonder if Youngguk really was an alien, just like Kim Dongjin said.

Soon, a white-haired elderly professor entered the lecture hall.

* * *

They say luck arrives unexpectedly. Despite the sleepless nights due to drama filming, hadn’t he devoted himself to the midterms?

Of course, he couldn’t afford to receive an academic warning after changing his curriculum so boldly to select major courses.

Perhaps it was thanks to his hard work with the mindset of avoiding a retake. He got better grades in the midterms than he had expected.

“Youngguk, you look particularly happy today.”

“The exam results came out today. They were better than I expected. By the way, why did you suddenly call me, sir?”

“I just wanted to see your face. When else would I see you if I didn’t call you like this? You’ve been too busy with school and filming to show up at the agency. Plus, I have some news to share.”

A playful look flashed across CEO Kim Seonghwan’s face.

“What news? If it’s about an advertising contract, I told you I wouldn’t be doing any for a while.”

“Hey, don’t paint me as a greedy CEO. Of course, it’s not that. The news I have to share is much more significant than an advertising contract. I was so excited when I heard it last night that I couldn’t sleep. I still can’t believe if it’s a dream or reality.”

What kind of news is he dragging out like this?

At that moment, CEO Kim Seonghwan leaned forward. Then he held up two fingers.

“There are two pieces of good news. Which one do you want to hear first?”

“There are two?”

“Actually, it would be best if Director Shin told you himself, but he probably contacted the agency to avoid disturbing you since you’re busy filming a drama.”

“Are you talking about Director Shin Seonghyun? Stop dragging it out and just tell me.”

In response to the urgent prodding, CEO Kim Seonghwan answered with a smile.

“Director Shin Seonghyun is getting married.”

“What?”

He was definitely a bachelor.

Even when they were filming “Confession of a Priest,” wasn’t he?

Director Shin Seonghyun’s elderly father in the countryside used to complain about his son not getting married.

At that moment, a scene flashed through his mind.

“No way! The art exhibition!”

Didn’t he visit the art exhibition last year with Yeonsu? At that time, he saw Director Shin Seonghyun standing with Yeonsu’s aunt. After that, half-joking and half-serious, he had even offered to give Director Shin Seonghyun Yeonsu’s aunt’s phone number.

“What? Youngguk, did you know? I heard Director Shin Seonghyun’s future wife is a painter. Doesn’t their professions match perfectly?”

“Well.”

There’s a saying that a quiet cat climbs onto the stove first. That saying fits this situation perfectly. Director Shin Seonghyun, who always seemed uninterested in romance, had moved quickly in his relationship.

But that wasn’t the end of it.

“And the last piece of news is really huge.”

“Director Shin Seonghyun getting married is already surprising. What is it?”

“Yes, last night, Director Shin Seonghyun excitedly told me. I was so surprised that I didn’t even think about his marriage news. It hasn’t been announced to the media yet.”

What on earth could it be? If CEO Kim Seonghwan is mentioning the media, it must be something significant. But no matter how much he thought, nothing came to mind.

“Youngguk.”

CEO Kim Seonghwan grabbed Youngguk’s hand and added.

“‘Confession of a Priest’ has been invited to the Cannes Film Festival!”

* * *

[‘Confession of a Priest’ Invited to Cannes Film Festival―!]

[Chungmuro’s New Actor Jang Youngguk, Becoming the Man of Cannes!]

[Daeseong Distributor Discussing Re-release of ‘Confession of a Priest: Director’s Cut’]

As the saying goes, walls have ears, and the news of ‘Confession of a Priest’ being invited to the Cannes Film Festival quickly spread through the media, causing a stir in Chungmuro.

Of course, ‘Confession of a Priest’ was not the first Korean film to be invited to the Cannes Film Festival.

For example, in the 1980s, Director Baek Janghoon’s film “Jirisan” was invited, and there were other directors whose works were also invited.

However.

[Film Critic Kim Jinseong, ‘Confession of a Priest’ is a work that captures both commercial and artistic value. Just being invited leaves a mark in Korean film history.]

As one critic said, it was a work that captured both commercial and artistic value. After all, it was the first film in Korea to surpass 8 million viewers.

Moreover, there were even evaluations that no adult-rated film would surpass the legacy of ‘Confession of a Priest’ for the next ten years, so it was no wonder.

“Youngguk, I always knew you’d do well!”

“Director Kim, everyone in Korea already knows that. Who doesn’t know that Youngguk is already a star? Anyway, congratulations, Youngguk.”

“Kim Youngmin, what do you know? I’ve known since Youngguk was little that he’d be something special. Didn’t Director Yoo hear that clearly back then? I’ve always cherished Youngguk like a treasure. Now he’s even going to France. Wow―! Becoming a global actor is just a matter of time now!”

The filming set was also bustling with the news of the Cannes Film Festival invitation.

But there were always those who were displeased with the buzz around Youngguk.

“Why are they making such a fuss over being invited to a film festival? Isn’t that right, Hyung?”

“Yeah, but lower your voice a bit, Seok.”

“Ugh, why are you so nervous? Shouldn’t seniors look out for juniors?”

It was actor Kim Jungseok, who shared the same name as actor Song Jungseok. He was a rising star with good looks. Having been a child actor for a long time, he could be considered Youngguk’s senior, but his acting skills were lacking, so he always played supporting roles.

“Hyung, didn’t the CEO mention any upcoming projects? He once promised to get me a lead role, but he’s been silent.”

“The CEO said he’s looking everywhere for a project. He’s getting synopses from Chungmuro and broadcasters, so let’s wait a bit. We need to be in a good project.”

“Ugh, if only I had a good project, rising to the top would be no problem.”

‘I can’t even hit this guy. Agh, he needs to improve his acting first.’

Manager Seok Hojung was suppressing his rising anger. If Jungseok were an ordinary actor, he wouldn’t dare speak to him like this.

But Kim Jungseok was the only son of the agency’s CEO. Born with a silver spoon, his arrogance was understandable.

“Jang Youngguk, he’s nothing special. Honestly, if I got the role of King Yeonsan, I could have done just as well. I’m better looking too.”

“Hey, Seok, lower your voice a bit.”

“Why do you keep telling me to be quiet! There’s no one around anyw...”

At that moment.

“Hey―!”

A sudden voice rang out.

Actor Kim Jungseok turned his head abruptly. There sat none other than actor Park Sangchul, who played the role of Kim Cheoseon, sitting quietly in a camping chair.

Manager Seok Hojung’s face turned pale. He had checked earlier that no one was around. When did Sangchul arrive?

Park Sangchul, frowning, looked directly at actor Kim Jungseok and spoke clearly.

“You’re disturbing me from reading the script, so shut up.”

* * *

“Scene number 59, The Tyranny of King Yeonsan―!”

A foreboding sense of bloodshed looms over the court.

The ministers, as if walking on thin ice, are desperately trying to survive, while the eyes of the king on the throne gleam as if he might wield a sword at any moment.

“Today’s regular council meeting is concluded.”

The ministers secretly sigh in relief. Though the regular council meeting happens daily, today the atmosphere was especially tense.

Rumor has it that many ministers disappeared without a trace overnight.

Eunuch Kim Cheoseon is aware of this but doesn’t speak lightly. Everything was as the king wished.

After ending the council meeting, King Yeonsan moved. Like the parting of the Red Sea, the ministers bowed and stepped aside to avoid obstructing the king’s path.

But at that moment, the king called someone. It was none other than the treacherous Im Sahong.

Like Kim Cheoseon, he followed the king humbly, as if he were a eunuch.

“Im Sahong, have you carried out what I ordered?”

“Your Majesty, I have followed your orders to the letter. They are bound in the backyard of Changgyeong Palace, ready for you to see at any time.”

‘……?’

What is this about? Sensing something odd in the king and Im Sahong’s conversation, Chief Eunuch Kim Cheoseon looked at King Yeonsan, but his expression revealed nothing.

At that moment, a person walking from a distance saw the king’s procession and stopped in surprise, bowing his head.

“Isn’t that my younger brother?”

It was none other than King Yeonsan’s half-brother, Prince Anyang, Lee Hang.

Lee Hang greeted the king with courtesy. King Yeonsan placed his hand on his half-brother’s shoulder and asked.

“What brings you here so early?”

“Your Majesty, I came to inquire about your well-being...”

“Why don’t I see your mother?”

Eunuch Kim Cheoseon’s eyes widened at the king’s rude question. But King Yeonsan continued speaking without a care.

“My younger brother is running around looking for his mother, so I should help.”

Former concubines of the previous king, Lady Eom and Lady Jeong, were bound in the backyard of Changgyeong Palace.

The reason was simple. They were involved in the deposition of Queen Yun and were suspected of conspiring to place their sons on the throne.

At that moment, King Yeonsan grabbed Prince Anyang, Lee Bong, by the shoulder and dragged him.

“Y-Your Majesty!”

Famous PD, staring at the screen, was speechless at the madness Youngguk displayed as King Yeonsan. Even in simple actions, he seemed to embody the tyrant fully.

At that moment.

‘……!’

Actor Kim Jungseok, who played Prince Anyang, tripped over a stone. According to the script, he was supposed to be dragged to Changgyeong Palace by the shoulder.

But at that moment, King Yeonsan extended a hand as if to help his fallen half-brother up.

“You’re not only foolish but also physically weak.”

Manager Seok Hojung watched the scene from the filming set. He could only imagine the curses actor Kim Jungseok would spew after the shoot.

But that wouldn’t happen. Although Youngguk extended his hand, actor Kim Jungseok was too stunned to react.

‘My knee hurts.’

It was an unexpected situation.

When he tripped over the stone, he expected an NG call. But the famous PD continued filming, drawing a circle in the air with his finger. The situation fit the script so well.

But actor Kim Jungseok couldn’t adapt. His acting and quick thinking were lacking. At that moment.

“I’ll help you up.”

Was it directed at actor Kim Jungseok who failed to adapt? Or was it King Yeonsan’s character manifesting?

A mix of anger, disappointment, and complex emotions surfaced in bloodshot eyes.

Unable to control his emotions, his fingers gripped his hair tightly.

Actor Kim Jungseok was flustered by the sudden rough fingers in his topknot.

Dragged up by his hair, he couldn’t even respond. It seemed like part of the script as he trembled.

Because Youngguk’s intense gaze made his knees weak.

‘What kind of person has eyes like that?’

It was as if he would kill him any moment.
