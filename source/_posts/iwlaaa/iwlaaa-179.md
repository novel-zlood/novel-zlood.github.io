Hong Kong (香港).

Hong Kong has historically played a leading role in Asia's film industry.

Perhaps due to the influence of British colonial rule, Eastern and Western cultures have harmoniously blended here, leading to the development of diverse cultural ideologies.

With this development, numerous masters in the film industry have emerged, among whom Director Wang Jinyang is renowned as a master of mise-en-scène.

"Mr. Jang! Please look over here―!"

Perhaps because it is the return of a master, the red carpet event is reminiscent of a film festival.

In front of Hong Kong's most famous theater, barricades have been set up and a red carpet has been laid out.

Jang Youngguk is walking with his partner with whom he filmed in Hong Kong, under a dazzling spotlight.

"Is that news true? The scandal."

Hong Kong actress Gwei Lun-mei said with a hint of regret. She was the lead actress in Director Wang Jinyang's film "Autumn Wind" and had worked with Jang Youngguk.

"Gwei Lun-mei, did you hear about it?"

"How could I not? Even if you haven't realized it yet, Mr. Jang is a very famous actor in Asia. His scandal was even reported in real-time on TVB."

"Sigh…"

He never imagined that the rumors had spread all the way to Hong Kong, let alone being reported in real-time.

"Well, at least it's a relief. To be honest, I thought Mr. Jang might like men."

"Excuse me…?"

"Just look at how things were during the shoot. Not to brag, but I've never not been asked out by my co-stars outside of the set. But Mr. Jang completely broke that record. We rarely had conversations outside the set, didn't we?"

That's definitely a humblebrag.

"Do you love that woman in Korea?"

"……!"

"Seeing how you can't answer right away, it seems the scandal is true. While I'm glad Mr. Jang likes women, I'm a bit jealous too."

Their conversation couldn't be heard over the noise of the red carpet. Instead, the reporters' shutters were busy capturing the smiles and friendly conversation between the two young stars.

At that moment, Gwei Lun-mei tightened her arm around his, pulling Jang Youngguk closer.

"It's a bit of a shame that such a handsome man has fallen into another woman's arms."

* * *

Meanwhile, Korea was also in an uproar.

Who is Jang Youngguk? Starting as a child actor and transitioning into adulthood, he is a young actor with an impeccable filmography. He is even receiving love calls from overseas.

A famous critic once praised him, saying, "An actor like Jang Youngguk is born once in a century."

"Hmm…"

Kim Sujin, the CEO of SW Entertainment, was having a meeting with actress Yeonsu. Looking at Yeonsu, who had her head down, Kim Sujin spoke with a hint of regret.

"It's not as if you've committed a grave sin, so why are you hanging your head like that?"

"You trusted and supported me…"

Yeonsu's voice trailed off. When she decided to study abroad in New York, the CEO had respected her opinion. Even when she changed her mind and decided to focus on her acting career again, the CEO had patted her on the shoulder, saying she made a good decision.

Actresses are sensitive to scandals, especially someone like Yeonsu, who is transitioning from a child actor to an adult actress. A scandal at this juncture can be like poison.

"Even a piece of paper makes a sound when it's clapped together. Why are you acting like a major criminal, as if it was all your fault? So, let me ask you directly. Yeonsu, are you really dating Jang Youngguk?"

"No…"

"Really? Even though the photos of you two hugging looked like you were definitely a couple?"

It was true. The paparazzi photos published in the entertainment weekly magazine looked affectionate enough to make anyone think they were a couple.

That might be why the scandal had exploded so massively.

Kim Sujin tapped her fingers on the desk a few times and then nodded, as if she had made a decision.

"I didn't call you in here to scold you. To be blunt, what's wrong with young men and women dating? It's only natural at your age. It should be celebrated, not criticized. But."

Kim Sujin paused for a moment before continuing.

"Fact-checking is crucial. If we say you're getting to know each other while Songwon Entertainment denies it, what would that make you? So, our statements need to align with theirs. I'll ask you one last time. Yeonsu, are you really not dating Jang Youngguk?"

"No…"

"Hmm…"

Kim Sujin sighed inwardly. She knew Yeonsu's personality well. After all, Yeonsu had been her agency's actress since she was a child.

In her judgment, Yeonsu was an active and bright child. If the scandal involved someone she wasn't actually close to, she wouldn't be hanging her head so dejectedly.

The night view of Hong Kong is beautiful. The dazzling lights from numerous skyscrapers are mesmerizing, like watching fireworks.

At the top floor of a hotel known as the tallest building in Hong Kong, the afterparty for "Autumn Wind" was in full swing.

The premiere was a success. No, calling it a success would be an understatement. It was a grand success.

Right after the premiere, film critics from around the world who were invited, as well as those from Hong Kong, unanimously praised the film. Even among the general public, who were not film industry insiders, the film received rave reviews.

"Mr. Jang, this is Director Li Aiwen from Taiwan. And this is Photographer Wang Wei from China."

"Nice to meet you. I'm actor Jang Youngguk."

"I really enjoyed the film. While it was fun to appreciate Director Wang Jinyang's mise-en-scène, I couldn't take my eyes off you throughout the movie. If the opportunity arises, I'd love to work with you."

"Thank you. I grew up watching your films, Director Li Aiwen, so it's an honor to hear that from you."

"I'd love to chat more, but Mr. Wang Wei here is waiting for his turn, so let's have a serious talk when I visit Korea."

As soon as Director Li Aiwen finished speaking, Wang Wei, who was next to him, spoke up.

"I'm Wang Wei, a photographer active in China."

"Active" is an understatement. In the photography world, Wang Wei is considered a master, just like Giovanni Sponza in Europe.

"I wanted to see the Korean actor who captivated Mr. Sponza. Now that I've seen you in person, I understand why Sponza was so eager to work with you. May I have your business card? It seems I have a reason to visit Korea sooner than Director Li Aiwen."

"Ah, just a moment. I didn't prepare any business cards. Jeongbong!"

It was impossible to count how many prominent figures had approached him. In his past life, he had never met such great people from various countries.

Most of them were close friends of Hong Kong's great director Wang Jinyang. As if by prior agreement, they greeted Wang Jinyang and then sought out Jang Youngguk.

'Wow, at this rate, all the famous people will gather in Korea!'

If Lee Bongchun were here, he would have said this for sure. Even if it were just lip service, it was rare for so many great figures to express their intention to visit Korea. Just then.

"Mr. Jang."

A floral fragrance tickled his nose. When he turned his head, he saw actress Gwei Lun-mei in a splendid red dress.

She handed him a glass of champagne and added.

"Shall we get some fresh air?"

* * *

The wind of Hong Kong blew at the top floor of the skyscraper. In one corner of the rooftop garden, Jang Youngguk and Gwei Lun-mei stood together.

"Mr. Jang, you don't like these kinds of parties, do you?"

"I don't particularly like them. But I'm just overwhelmed by the number of people who came to see me. In Korea, afterparties for premieres aren't this grand."

"There are many rich people in Hong Kong and Macau. People with a lot of influence from China, Taiwan, and even Russia gather here. After every premiere in Hong Kong, the afterparties are always grand. It's hard to get used to at first."

"Ms. Gwei Lun-mei, you seem to be very comfortable with parties."

"Nonsense."

Gwei Lun-mei stretched her arms to relieve her stiff shoulders and continued.

"I don't like these parties either. But after experiencing them several times, I got used to it. Honestly, I'd rather soak in warm water and have a beer. Really."

Jang Youngguk couldn't help but laugh. It was endearing to see a top actress from Hong Kong hastily defending herself.

"I brought you out because you seemed very exhausted. I thought some fresh air might help."

"Did it show so much on my face?"

"No, you're a master of controlling your expressions. Although Director Wang Jinyang is the host of this party, the main attraction was undoubtedly you, Mr. Jang. It was impressive to see you conversing so comfortably with such great figures. If it were any other actor, they'd probably be sweating bullets and being dragged around by now. But look at you, Mr. Jang. You're polite yet confident, as if you're on equal footing with them."

'Did I really seem that way?'

Jang Youngguk didn't know how he appeared to others. He was just behaving as he usually did, but it seemed to give off an impression of confidence and equality in front of the great figures.

"But I don't think the party is what's troubling you right now. It's probably because of that person in Korea, right?"

"Ms. Gwei Lun-mei, if you weren't an actress, you could have been a fortune-teller. Yes, I'm worried about the young actress and how she might be affected by the current scandal. More so because the scandal isn't true."

Gwei Lun-mei took a sip of her champagne and looked at Jang Youngguk.

"It's not true?"

The dazzling lights of the skyscrapers reflected on the champagne glass. Jang Youngguk nodded briefly in response to Gwei Lun-mei's repeated question.

"Mr. Jang, from what I felt on the set, you tend to hide your true feelings. This is an excellent strategy in business relationships because it makes the other party more anxious. However, if you do the same in a romantic relationship, it can only mean two things. Either you're a playboy, or you've never been in a relationship."

"……."

"From what I see, you're the latter. Initially, I thought you might be a playboy based on your looks, but after talking to you today, I'm sure. You're very worried about and miss the person in Korea, don't you? Opportunities don't come often, especially in love. So."

Gwei Lun-mei smiled gently, like the wind of Hong Kong, and added.

"Please don't hide your true feelings."
