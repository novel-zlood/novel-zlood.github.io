There's a proverb that says it's harder to silence the people's voices than to block a river. This means that public opinion is not easily suppressed.

The press conference held by the great figures of Chungmuro caused a reaction more intense than a rapid current.

- A pack of hyenas aiming for a scoop, we can't just stand by and watch!

- The victim cries while the perpetrator laughs.

- BS Entertainment's CEO Yang Sugap is under sudden investigation by the prosecution―!

- Late-night raid on BS Entertainment's headquarters by the prosecution!

People are gathering and raising their voices. In front of the Yeouido press office, there were already protests condemning the unruly reporters.

The impact of the live-broadcasted press conference was tremendous.

Even broadcasting stations were reporting news condemning the reporters as the headline for the 9 o'clock news.

“A dog with shit on its fur scolding a dog with chaff on its fur, ridiculous.”

CEO Kim Seonghwan clicked his tongue. It was understandable because the broadcasting industry, which had moved in unison with the reporters, sensed the public opinion and quickly changed its stance.

“I don't like those broadcasting station guys. They're like bats, sticking here and there. If this is how adults survive, there's nothing we can do. But I don't know why I'm saying this to you, Youngguk.”

CEO Kim Seonghwan turned off the television irritably.

Youngguk saw his face reflected on the darkened screen and widened his eyes. The shadow that had been deeply cast on his face seemed to have lifted a bit.

“Youngguk, are you really not going on the reward vacation?”

“……”

“You didn't go last time with SBC either. Back then, it was because of a scheduling conflict, but now it's different. Isn't it a waste?”

“It's fine, and I'm still attending school.”

“Oh right, I almost forgot. But if two of the main actors are missing from the reward vacation...”

“I already told PD Yoo. Due to my studies, it's hard to take a week off from the schedule. Honestly, I don't like flying either.”

“What? You’ve only taken domestic flights, and anyone would think you’ve flown internationally a lot.”

Youngguk smiled faintly and shrugged his shoulders.

Reflecting on his past experiences, he had indeed flown internationally more than enough. Not only for vacations but also frequently for drama reward vacations to resorts.

“By the way, why did you call me today?”

“Youngguk.”

CEO Kim Seonghwan leaned forward.

“Let's take a break from acting for a while.”

A storm-like incident had passed, but the university remained peaceful.

In Cheongdam, students were gathered in groups, enjoying their lunch, and some were strumming guitars under old trees, savoring their youth.

Walking around the campus, CEO Kim Seonghwan's words still lingered in his mind.

- I spoke strongly because I thought you wouldn’t listen otherwise. Even now, look at you. As soon as you joined the agency, you’ve been reviewing the synopsis for your next project. Other actors would have taken some time off to bask in the success of their completed project. But Youngguk, you seem desperate to act.

- ……

- It's funny for an agency CEO to tell this to an actor, but I want you to take a break from acting for a while. No matter how strong and enthusiastic you are, you never know when you might burn out. It's like cooking rice; you need to let it steam to make it sticky and glossy. I hope you also take some time to steam. This is advice from an old man who cares about you, not just your agency CEO.

Steaming.

It was the first time he had heard such advice in his acting career. Certainly, it was rare for an agency CEO to say such things to an actor.

Looking back, he had taken on many roles at a young age. CEO Kim Seonghwan's advice to enjoy his school days seemed to have been in vain.

Anxiety.

It must have been because of the anxiety from his past life. Moving from one minor role to another made him realize how grateful he was to be acting. As an actor, his desire to act would often suffocate him.

It was different from the thirst of top-tier actors. They could always quench their thirst, but for an unknown actor moving from minor role to minor role, acting was like a lifeline from the heavens.

“I am truly blessed with good people.”

While many tried to hop on the fast-moving train, none made him pause to appreciate the scenery around him.

How many people make you realize that the straight path you thought you were on was actually a series of crossroads in life?

Had he not been noticed by a famous PD at Yeongdo Namhang Market, he wouldn't have started acting and met CEO Kim Seonghwan.

“A civil servant.”

He recalled his childhood dream he once mentioned to his teacher. It was a profession he chose to live a not-so-wealthy but happy life with his mother. If he hadn't started acting again, another crossroad in life would have unfolded.

It was then.

“What kind of civil servant?”

Oh my god.

“Don't tell me you're preparing for the civil service exam, Youngguk?!”

It was his senior, Kim Dongjin, who attended the lecture with him. Just like his constant bragging about the rugby club, there was a strong smell of sweat coming from his orange uniform.

As the scent tickled his nose, causing his brow to furrow, Kim Dongjin wrapped his arm around his shoulder as if ready to joke.

“Ah, senior―!”

“No matter how I look at it, your broad shoulders are perfect for the rugby team. Such a great talent wasting away here.”

He was a very informal person. In some ways, he was even more friendly than the peers he met in university.

Others, knowingly or unknowingly, kept their distance because of his actor status.

“By the way, don't be too upset.”

“……?”

“You know, all the commotion lately. You missed classes for a few days, and I was worried. I even took perfect notes in Professor Shin Jeonggil's lecture, want to see them?”

No thanks, Kim Dongjin’s notes were like worms crawling on the paper. Surely, he had the brains to be admitted to Korea University Law School.

“It's fine.”

“Hey, it's not modesty to refuse when a senior is looking out for you!”

“Seriously, senior, your handwriting is so bad I can't read it.”

“They say geniuses have bad handwriting. Hehe.”

It was when they reached the front of the law school building.

“By the way, Youngguk, you know the final exam for the criminal mock trial is a group project, right?”

“I heard.”

“Yeah, I figured you’d already know. You topped the midterm exam after all. Hehe.”

Kim Dongjin flashed a meaningful smile. But anyway.

“Senior.”

He called out to Kim Dongjin, who was heading straight to the lecture hall, and asked.

“Are you really going to attend class dressed like that?”

“Why?”

Kim Dongjin looked down at his orange uniform from the rugby club. His face showed a puzzled expression, as if wondering what was wrong.

“You smell a lot like sweat.”

It was to the point where one might suspect sinusitis. No matter how hard it is to smell your own odor, the sweat smell was so strong that it couldn't go unnoticed.

Moreover, his knees and elbows were covered in dirt. Just by looking at his outfit, one would believe he was a physical education student rather than a law student.

Then Kim Dongjin opened the lecture hall door and said,

“It’s youth!”

Watching Kim Dongjin enter the lecture hall, exuding sweat smell, made him burst into laughter.

For some reason, when walking with this person, it felt like he was not actor Jang Youngguk but university student Jang Youngguk.

* * *

As per CEO Kim Seonghwan's advice to take time to steam, he attended lectures as university student Jang Youngguk.

An elderly professor with sharp eyes was giving a lecture.

“There are still many laws that need to be improved among the current laws. For example, there is the issue of unauthorized medical treatment by medical professionals. As summer approaches, many people will visit valleys, and many accidents happen while swimming.”

Even though he tried to focus on the lecture, he couldn't. The reason was simple. The sweat smell was so strong that it made him dizzy.

As time passed, the sweat smell seemed to ferment and become even stronger.

Whether aware or not, Kim Dongjin continued to smile and showed no intention of changing his uniform.

Then someone poked him in the side and handed him a note.

“Give this to him.”

Shin Jaehee gestured towards Kim Dongjin with her head. Glancing at the note's content, it was as expected.

[Kim Dongjin, you idiot! Are you announcing to the world that you just played rugby? Change your clothes! Do you think this is a playground!]

The anger was evident in the scribbled handwriting, showing how furious she was.

“The young man survived thanks to the doctor but sued for a large physical and mental compensation as his ribs were broken and his lungs were torn during CPR. Despite the fact that broken ribs are common during CPR, the court sided with the young man, stating that he expressed refusal during the procedure. This single case shows how flawed and ignorant the current laws on emergency medical care are.”

Shin Jaehee handed him another note.

‘You could have just given it to him directly.’

Somehow, he ended up sitting between Shin Jaehee and Kim Dongjin. Just then,

“So, does anyone have a comment on this case?”

The elderly professor scanned the students and made eye contact with him.

“Yes, Jang Youngguk, would you like to give your thoughts?”

Cold sweat formed on his back. Shin Jaehee blinked apologetically, and Kim Dongjin breathed a sigh of relief that it wasn't him.

“In France, there's the Good Samaritan law that penalizes those who don’t help people in distress. Instead of creating a system that legally binds people’s morality, we need to find more effective ways to improve current laws. It’s like saying ‘I saved you from drowning, now give me your bundle.’ This issue requires not just legal experts but also politicians from various government sectors to work together.”

“Very insightful answer. Yes, as a law student, you must think from various angles.”

Just then, the clock’s second hand indicated the end of the lecture. The professor smiled and looked around the students.

“Remember, the final exam for the criminal mock trial will be a group project, so make sure to prepare diligently with your assigned groups.”

Group assignment?

“By the way, which group is Jang Youngguk in? You missed the last lecture, so you wouldn’t know.”

Then, Kim Dongjin, sitting next to him, raised his hand quietly.

Damn.
