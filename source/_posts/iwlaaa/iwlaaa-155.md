SBC Broadcasting Station.

"Hey, Kim Jin―!"

A roar from the drama director burst out. Just from seeing his face turn red and blue, one could tell how angry he was.

On the opposite side, PD Kim Jin stood with his head bowed, looking as if he had committed a grave sin.

"It's already the second time, the second time―! Because of you, I developed enteritis, which I never had before. Do you know that in baseball, a third strike means you're out? And yet you're asking for one more chance? Do you think the company is a charity organization?"

Kim Jin wanted to crawl into a hole. He had once been renowned as a hit PD due to the past drama "Youth."

But just as the saying "the first success is often the last" goes, his subsequent projects failed miserably.

If it had been an ordinary miniseries, the drama director wouldn't have been so furious.

It was a high-quality drama.

Its production cost far exceeded that of any ordinary miniseries.

From the cast to the writers, it was equipped with top-tier talent and even had overseas shooting.

There was certainty of success, but the public's response was cold. Isn't the value of a drama department originally measured by viewership ratings?

The ratings skyrocketed only during the premiere but continued to plummet afterward. The result for both projects was the same,

Early termination.

The drama director, still not over his anger, glared at Kim Jin and shouted,

"Do you think you have the conscience to come to me now? Do you know how much I've been berated in the executive meetings? The head of the department told me not to give you any more scheduling rights."

"……!"

Damn.

He had trusted the department head. He had always been the one to fulfill the department head's needs, visiting whenever called and bringing expensive whiskey and Korean beef sets during holidays.

Is this what they mean by "betrayed by a trusted friend"? No, "discarded after use" fits better. Damn it.

"Director, please give me one last chance. If I fail again, I'll resign."

"Huh, you crazy bastard. What are you trying to pull now?"

"Excuse me?"

"Do you think the drama department is a baseball field where we implement a three-strike rule? And did you think I'd beg you to stay if you offered to resign? Write your resignation right now, you fool! And do you know how resentful the other PDs are because I pushed you twice already? Do you think I'll grant a scheduling request without a plan? Unless you've snagged a superstar, I don't want to hear it. Go assist Director B on set. Get out!"

"I can't leave like this. Please, just one more chance……!"

As Kim Jin tried to stay, the drama director picked up his nameplate, ready to throw it if Kim Jin didn't leave.

Startled, Kim Jin hurriedly left the director's office.

"Sigh."

The bustling drama department fell silent at Kim Jin PD's sigh. Everyone must have overheard the conversation. No, it wasn't even eavesdropping.

The director's voice was so loud that even the youngest AD at the far end of the partition could hear it.

'Damn it.'

Kim Jin swallowed his curse. Despite being scolded so harshly in the director's office, no one came to comfort him.

Thud.

He threw himself onto a chair. The youngest AD next to him, noticing, quietly slipped into the break room.

The kid avoided him as if someone might mistakenly think they were on the same side. A wretched life.

During "Youth," he was busy greeting everyone in the drama department.

Yes, the drama department is a jungle. It's a world of survival of the fittest.

- Unless you've snagged a superstar!

The director's words echoed in his mind. A drama superstar refers to an actor who guarantees a hit. As far as he knew, there was only one such actor.

But then he noticed the morning newspaper on the table.

[Exclusive Model Contract with Desiderio, Actor Jang Youngguk Heads to Italy!]

The face of the guaranteed hit was plastered on the front page.

The headline made it clear. The bus had already left. No, considering his value now, calling it a limousine would be more accurate.

* * *

Leonardo da Vinci Airport, Italy.

Rome in October is similar to early autumn in Korea. The temperature drops significantly in the evening, requiring outerwear, but it's warm enough to wear short sleeves during the day.

Since it was an international airport frequented by foreigners, there was no need to hide one's face like in Korea. Even without a hat and sunglasses, there were no people who recognized him.

"Youngguk, I really owe you for this."

Lee Bongchun, who was flying internationally for the first time, still had an excited look on his face.

Passersby merely glanced at him and walked by. Lee Bongchun looked around with a determined expression.

"I heard racism is really severe here..."

Well, from their perspective, a large Asian man looking excitedly around must have seemed strange.

Moreover, to a stranger, Lee Bongchun might appear more like a mobster than a manager. He was even held up at immigration for over an hour.

"Mr. Jang."

At that moment, someone who had come to meet them arrived. It was none other than Desiderio's secretary, Giordana, with his long mustache. Of course, there was also an interpreter who looked quite similar. It wasn't just because they were both white.

While Giordana's interpreter greeted them, Giordana merely made brief eye contact and gave a short nod. Interpreter Alfredo explained,

"Giordana is my older brother. Mr. Jang, he's usually very quiet, so please don't be offended."

"Understood. So where are we headed now?"

"We will first move to a place where you can rest and adjust to the time difference. It's the place you will be staying in Rome."

Seeing the limousine parked at the airport entrance, Lee Bongchun's eyes widened like a rabbit's. The car looked expensive at first glance.

As the chauffeur opened the door and they got inside, it was even more impressive. It was stocked with champagne, wine, various chocolates, and cheeses.

With the chauffeur's skillful driving, the limousine began to leave the airport. Then, Giordana, sitting across from them, asked something to his brother Alfredo. Alfredo then turned to me and asked,

"Mr. Jang, did only the two of you come?"

"Yes, is there a problem?"

"No, it's just that we had planned to support you fully, so it doesn't matter."

The reason for the small group heading to Italy was largely due to a lack of experience. There had never been a case in the Korean entertainment industry where someone became the exclusive model for a high-end foreign luxury brand.

Moreover, Desiderio had promised to cover all expenses, including lodging, meals, and even providing a hairstylist and stylist. So, from Songwon Entertainment's perspective, sending a large team was burdensome.

Upon hearing Alfredo's explanation, Giordana slightly smirked. It was quite annoying.

"Alfredo, is there a problem?"

I asked again, and Alfredo replied apologetically,

"Actually, all previous models for Desiderio had brought their own teams. From stylists to hairstylists, even trainers and secretaries. Even the Hollywood actor who brought the smallest team had dozens of people. So when I first saw just Mr. Jang and Mr. Lee, I was quite taken aback."

So that's why he had that expression when we first met.

Songwon Entertainment had never experienced anything like this, so there was a lot of back and forth.

The CEO initially wanted to form a team but hesitated, worrying it might be a burden on Desiderio, who had promised to prepare everything. I couldn't give any advice either, as I had no experience in this matter.

It was embarrassing, but there was no other choice. Such experiences would help us grow.

How much time had passed?

The scenery of Italy seen through the car window gradually changed into a forest road filled with tall old trees. The road was smoother than the bumpy roads of Rome.

As the limousine passed through a massive iron gate, Alfredo said,

"We're almost at your accommodation."

"It's still a forest."

"Oh, this is the garden."

I was speechless. It was a vast area that could rival any large forest park. If not for the paved road and the iron gate, one might think it was just a forest.

Finally, a large palace-like building came into view through the car window.

Wow.

The garden was just an appetizer. As the entire building came into view, Lee Bongchun, sitting next to me, moved his face close to the window.

I couldn't tell if it was a renovated castle where nobles once lived or a modern building designed in Baroque style, but it was undoubtedly captivating.

Outside the building were lavish statues and a golden pond reflecting the brilliant sunlight. Then,

"Hmph."

Giordana smirked again. He must have been mocking Lee Bongchun's face pressed against the window.

I wanted to smack Giordana in the back of the head but couldn't. However, just sitting still didn't feel right either.

"Alfredo, is it common for Italians to have poor facial expressions?"

I had to ask directly. Alfredo looked at me with a puzzled expression, as if he didn't understand.

"Why do you ask, Mr. Jang?"

"Giordana."

"Ah."

Finally, Alfredo seemed to understand. Giordana had been cold since the airport.

Although Alfredo had excused him by saying he was usually quiet, it didn't seem right.

Moreover, this wasn't how you should treat guests who had traveled a long way.

As Alfredo struggled to respond, Giordana looked at us, sensing the strange atmosphere. Lee Bongchun also stopped looking out the window and observed the situation.

I stared directly at Giordana and asked in English since I couldn't speak Italian. He should understand this much.

"Giordana, don't you think your rudeness is tarnishing Desiderio's reputation?"
