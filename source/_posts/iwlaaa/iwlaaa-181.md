Double Celebration.

"Scene number 37, Dance with the Merman Prince—!"

The assistant director's voice grew louder. The staff's eyes all turned to the filming site at once.

Their gazes carried a wish that this time the shot would be perfect without any NGs.

PD Kim Woo-hyung leaned forward towards the displayed screen.

The filming site was a ballroom. Fancy chandeliers and elegant classical music filled the air.

The party attendees all had stiff necks.

They held champagne glasses in one hand while engaging in conversations with each other.

The topics of their conversations were extraordinary. They discussed national policies, real estate, and sums of money amounting to billions and trillions of won.

To an outsider, it might have seemed like a gathering of delusional people.

The members of this party were the second generation of the business magnates who controlled South Korea.

Han Myojeong (Yeonsu) genuinely disliked these social gatherings.

Like the joke that says they started out by holding the umbilical cord, they were all second-generation chaebols thanks to their well-chosen parents.

But they all had a sense of entitlement similar to that of a chosen people, considering ordinary people as mere cogs in their machine, just parts for their use.

"Disgusting."

It was a social gathering she attended because she couldn't resist her father's coercion. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the second-generation chaebols' romantic relationships began here.

However, ordinary romance was out of the question. Instead of sweet whispers of love, it was a tool for arranged marriages based on each person's interests and calculations.

"Myojeong, I've been wanting to meet you, and here we are."

"Oh, yes."

"Our chairman asked me to convey his deep gratitude to your father. If you have the opportunity, could we talk separately today? It would be a very beneficial choice for both you and your father."

Many men approached Han Myojeong, who was dressed in a pure white gown.

They were all heirs to leading companies in South Korea. Although they maintained polite appearances, a closer look at their demeanor revealed a strong sense of entitlement.

It was evident from the way they referred to their fathers or grandfathers as "chairman."

"I'm a bit tired today."

At Han Myojeong's cold attitude, the man twisted his lips.

"I understand that discussions have already taken place between your father and our chairman. Aren't you curious? Since you mentioned you're tired, we'll leave it for another time. But remember, a rose is more beautiful with its thorns, but a withered rose's thorns are rather unsightly."

"What did you say?"

"Isn't it true that the group you're supposed to inherit is in a precarious situation? You can tell just by your father sending his only daughter to a shabby hotel in Busan. Goodbye."

What kind of jerk is he!

Han Myojeong glared at the man, but he turned his head with a sneer.

She wanted to immediately throw off this cumbersome dress and storm out of there.

Even after that, countless men approached Han Myojeong to test the waters, but her cold attitude only elicited sneers and turned heads.

"I miss Isu (Youngguk)."

Only one person came to her mind.

Eventually, the social gathering reached its peak. It was the moment when men and women held hands and danced.

It was as if they were emulating a gathering of European medieval nobles. They still believed that South Korea was a class society and that they were in the position of nobility. At that moment, the man who had sneered at Han Myojeong approached her again.

"Lady, would you like to dance with me?"

His face was full of arrogance, as if she couldn't refuse him.

Given Han Myojeong's personality, it wouldn't have been surprising if she had thrown her high heel at his face right then.

But everything that happened at the social gathering would get back to her father. It was then.

"Myojeong."

At the familiar voice, Han Myojeong turned her head. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that everyone's attention in the room was drawn to the source of the voice.

It was as if a bright halo shone in the gloomy ballroom. The man's face, which had been trying to hit on Han Myojeong, instantly crumpled.

Grab.

The man holding her hand was none other than Isu. As he strode towards the center of the ballroom, everyone made way for him.

It was only natural because his presence was on a different level from those who fancied themselves as nobles.

Everyone looked at him as if he were the protagonist of the event. Isu looked at Han Myojeong and spoke.

"Am I very late?"

For the first time, Han Myojeong showed a bright smile.

After the shoot.

The continuous NGs disappeared like a lie after a short break. The tension at the filming site vanished, and the lead actors performed their roles as if they were possessed by the characters, making everything progress swiftly.

The staff, who had been prepared for an all-nighter, couldn't hide their smiles at the director's continuous cut signals.

"Oppa."

The blue waves splashed. Seagulls chirped as people enjoyed their beach time.

Two people stood on the terrace of the filming site where the social gathering had taken place, overlooking the beach and the sand, and Yeonsu spoke.

"Thank you."

"For what?"

"There was a scene like that in a fairy tale I read when I was young. A guardian deity always appears to help the protagonist when they're in danger. To me, oppa is like that. No matter what problem arises, you handle it effortlessly. Even today’s shoot, if someone else had been the counterpart, we'd have had NGs all night."

‘If I wasn’t your counterpart, you wouldn’t have been so nervous, Yeonsu.’

Youngguk didn't express his thoughts outwardly. In fact, he was also partly responsible for Yeonsu's repeated NGs.

After all, she's an actress. She couldn't help but be sensitive to scandals, especially when her scandal partner was away in Hong Kong.

"Oppa, I have a confession to make."

Yeonsu hesitated for a moment, then, as if she had made up her mind, she took a deep breath and spoke candidly.

"Honestly, I was happy when the scandal article came out."

"Really?"

"Yes, I was happy because it was with you. As you know, you’re my first love. Now that I’ve said it, I feel relieved."

Yeonsu's expression looked relieved, as if a long-held burden had been lifted. To think that he was someone’s first love made Youngguk’s heart flutter in a way he never expected.

"But I’ll let go of my lingering feelings now. From now on, I’ll just like you as a fellow actor. So you don’t have to feel so sorry in front of me. When you get a girlfriend, make sure to introduce her to me first. And don’t date some weird fox-like woman. Though I’m sure you’ll handle it well…”

Yeonsu's voice was evidently trembling, but she brushed her nose as if she didn't want to show it and smiled.

-Please don't hide your feelings.

At that moment, Gui Lunmei’s advice came to mind. His heart felt strange. His heart was pounding, and as Yeonsu hurried to leave, he became extremely anxious.

It was then that Youngguk realized he had been suppressing himself with the constraints of his past life. Though his past life was also a part of him, the important thing was the present.

Grab.

Youngguk took Yeonsu's hand.

And then,

"I don't think I’ll have any reason to introduce you to my girlfriend."

"What?"

"Because I like you too."

He confessed.

Lee Hyesook was busy preparing dinner. From seafood to seasonal vegetables and braised short ribs, the table was filled with a feast that could rival a king's 12-course royal meal.

On the other hand, Kim Sunghoon, who was helping with the cooking, was fidgety.

"Honey, take a break. I'll handle the rest."

"It's all done."

"Still..."

Lee Hyesook was more enthusiastic than ever. It was only natural since her son was visiting after a long time.

Moreover, he was bringing someone with him. Although he hadn't said who it was, he mentioned that he had good news, which filled her with anticipation.

In fact, Lee Hyesook also had something to confess to her son.

"But how did Guk find out and say he was coming?"

"Didn't Jisoo tell him?"

"No way. She told us to keep it a secret and said she'd keep her lips sealed."

Keep it a secret.

They were curious about what it might be, but the two of them exchanged shy smiles without saying more.

Just then, Jisoo returned from her evening self-study session.

As soon as Jisoo entered the house, she sniffed the aroma of the food and exclaimed.

"Wow!"

Jisoo, who was munching on a piece of well-cooked meatball, was scolded by her father. She looked quite upset.

"You should wash your hands before eating."

"It looked so delicious that I couldn't resist. Isn't it mean to treat a daughter who studied until this hour like this? And why hit me when you can just tell me! Right, Mom?"

"Of course, my Jisoo worked hard."

"See, Mom is the best."

"Studied? Jisoo, didn’t your teacher call and say you got caught reading comic books during class? She asked us to guide you well. What do you carry in your school bag, anyway? Bring your bag here!"

Jisoo darted to the bathroom. Watching her, Kim Sunghoon shook his head, and Lee Hyesook burst out laughing.

Soon, the doorbell rang. Kim Sunghoon told Lee Hyesook to sit down and hurriedly ran to the entrance.

"Dad...?"

Youngguk tilted his head at the sight of Kim Sunghoon coming to greet him.

Though he was his stepfather, calling him "dad" no longer felt awkward. But seeing Kim Sunghoon in an apron was quite strange.

Kim Sunghoon also realized how he looked and laughed awkwardly, scratching his head. Then he beamed at the woman walking in with Youngguk.

"Yeonsu, come on in!"

It was a warm family dinner. The table was laden with so many delicacies that it was hard to decide where to start.

Feeling a bit guilty, Youngguk spoke to his mother, who had prepared such a feast.

"You didn't have to prepare so much just because I was coming. We could've kept it simple."

"When you're bringing a guest, this much is necessary. Besides, didn't you say you have good news?"

Not only Lee Hyesook but also Kim Sunghoon and his younger sister Jisoo looked at them expectantly.

Youngguk wasn't one to delay things. Especially not on a day like today.

Grabbing Yeonsu's hand under the table, he spoke.

"We've decided to start dating."

"Really?"

"Oppa! I knew it! You and Yeonsu unnie suit each other so well! Unnie, you're really family now!"

With everyone's congratulations, Yeonsu blushed and smiled shyly.

"But Mom, didn’t you and Dad also have something to tell me?"

At Youngguk's question, this time it was Lee Hyesook who blushed like a new bride.

Kim Sunghoon was the same. Meanwhile, Jisoo seemed eager to say something, her mouth twitching.

As Youngguk looked at the three curiously, Lee Hyesook held Kim Sunghoon's hand and spoke.

"Guk, actually..."

Holding Kim Sunghoon's hand, Lee Hyesook continued.

"You're going to have a sibling."
