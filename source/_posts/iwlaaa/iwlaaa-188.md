10 years later.

Kim PD's face showed evident satisfaction after finishing the interview. They were in the middle of filming a documentary about actor Jang Youngguk.

Although he was already a world-famous actor, ironically, there was little widely known information about him.

This was because he adhered strictly to a mysterious persona.

"His fame wasn't for nothing."

Gwak Myunghwan, a senior journalist known as a living witness of South Korea's entertainment history, had his reputation well-deserved. He knew all the behind-the-scenes stories about actor Jang Youngguk that had never been reported in the media.

"Thank you so much for today's interview, Mr. Gwak."

"No, it was my pleasure. It was a delightful time reminiscing about the past. So, the filming is all done?"

"Yes, it's all finished."

At Kim PD's nod, the cameraman turned off the red light on the filming camera.

"Excuse me, Mr. Gwak. May I ask you one more thing?"

"Off the record?"

"Yes, it's just that I'm curious about actor Jang Youngguk's next project. He hasn't been active for a few years after his consecutive box-office hits in Hollywood. There are many rumors in the broadcasting world because of that. I thought you might know... I'm asking purely as a fan of Jang Youngguk, and it won't be used in the documentary. I promise."

Actor Jang Youngguk's next project was still a hot issue that made headlines in South Korea. The MBS drama 'Mermaid Prince' that aired 10 years ago was a massive hit.

Even though it had a sad ending, perhaps because of that, there were even more fans supporting the real-life romance rumors between Youngguk and Yeonsu.

Since 'Mermaid Prince' 10 years ago, actor Jang Youngguk hadn't appeared in any terrestrial dramas.

That was the time he started to make his mark on the global stage. The film 'Autumn Wind' directed by Wang Jinyang, which premiered in Hong Kong, was invited to international film festivals, and that was his gateway to Hollywood.

When it was announced that Hollywood would produce a movie with Jang Youngguk as the lead, there were many concerns.

After all, it was a time when it seemed difficult for an Asian to take the lead role and break into the fortress of Hollywood. However.

The Hollywood films starring Jang Youngguk not only broke box office records but also became global hits. And he accomplished this with three consecutive films.

"I'll give it a try."

"Yes?"

Kim PD looked puzzled at Gwak Myunghwan's words. Then.

"I'm late for my next appointment. It seems the guest has been waiting too long. Kim PD."

"Oh, yes, sorry."

Kim PD and the cameraman hurriedly stood up and walked out of the chief editor's office.

But the last words of Gwak Myunghwan still lingered in Kim PD's mind.

And the meaning of those words was confirmed on the sofa outside the chief editor's office.

"Is that... Jang Youngguk?!"

Jang Youngguk, who stood up from the sofa, walked past Kim PD and entered the chief editor's office.

* * *

"Why was the interview so long?"

Youngguk had built quite a friendship with chief editor Gwak Myunghwan. Over the past 10 years, while working in Hollywood, Gwak Myunghwan had been a great help.

"Did you not want to appear too long in the documentary about actor Jang? Then you should have done the interview yourself. They seemed to be eagerly waiting for actor Jang to do it."

Youngguk shook his head. He didn't feel inclined to do interviews then or now.

Especially not for filming. Even if it was a documentary, he found it burdensome because he knew it would write his story like a biography.

"By the way, how are Hyung Joonhyun and Director Baek Janghoon doing?"

"Uncle has retired from acting and is still busy nurturing young talents, and you know Grandpa. He's still traveling all over the country preparing for his new project. This time, he said he is making a film about herbalists in the Joseon Dynasty."

"Haha, Director Baek Janghoon is still the same despite the years. His passion is unmatched, even more than young directors."

The two of them, who hadn't seen each other in a while, continued their conversation without realizing how time was passing.

Since Gwak Myunghwan had been a great help during Youngguk's time in Hollywood, they had become very close.

"If I hadn't been dispatched to the U.S. back then, I wonder if I could have built this friendship with you, actor Jang. But do you still stay in touch with Director Jims these days?"

"Of course, he contacts me at least once a week. Starting with when I'm coming back to the U.S., he keeps saying he'll come to Korea whenever he gets a chance, so it's always a struggle to dissuade him."

"Well, he likes you, actor Jang... You saved him from being a washed-up old man in Hollywood and turned him into a renowned director."

"It was a good collaboration. I was a rookie making my first foray into Hollywood from Asia, and Director Jims was a veteran preparing for his last hurrah in Hollywood."

Director Jims Filmer, once called a master of Hollywood, had been on the verge of becoming a has-been as his hit films dwindled over time.

Meeting Youngguk during such a period and setting unprecedented records with three consecutive Hollywood hits, it was no wonder he was so eager.

"So, you'll be going back to the U.S. soon?"

At Gwak Myunghwan's question, Youngguk shook his head.

"This time, I'm planning to go down to Yeongdo."

At the mention of Yeongdo, Gwak Myunghwan nodded briefly. It was the city where Youngguk's family lived.

"I think I'll return to Hollywood for my next project. If I find a script that I like, I'll move again. So, this time, I'm going to Yeongdo to clear my head. It's also my father's memorial day."

* * *

Like a moth.

Flying towards a dim light.

It was where everything started anew. He had come back to break the chains of his past life.

The shabby inn room, once filled with cobwebs and mold, was now spotless, not showing a speck of dust.

The cracked clock was intact, and the worn-out blankets were now fluffy as if they were new.

"Thank you for showing me."

"You're not going to rent the room?"

"No, it's fine."

He handed the landlady a white envelope filled with money and left.

The landlady looked puzzled. It was no wonder she was confused, as a man suddenly came in, glanced around the inn room, and handed her money.

"What is this money for?"

The landlady's voice came from behind.

"It's to pay back what I owe."

With just that short remark, he walked away again.

In his past life, he hadn't been able to pay even the lodging fee for the monthly-rented room at this inn.

He walked for quite a while after leaving the inn. Soon, he saw the breakwater. Following it, he headed towards the Namhang Market.

Though passersby occasionally recognized Youngguk's face, they only harbored doubts, wondering if it was really him, as he walked around so freely, without approaching him.

"Is that Guk?!"

"Did Youngguk come?"

"Wow! It's our world star!"

But Namhang Market was different. From Mr. Choi at the fruit shop to the shop and herb store owners, and even Ms. Yang at the fish stall, all the merchants recognized Youngguk and waved at him warmly.

Youngguk also politely bowed to them in response.

"Oppaya!"

As he entered his mother's shop in Namhang, Jisoo, now a young lady, greeted him. She had been a middle school kid with a runny nose when he first saw her, but now she was a grown adult. She was a very kind younger sister who worked in Busan and sometimes came on weekends to help her mother. And.

"Oppaaaa!!"

Another younger sister came running from behind Jisoo. It was Minjeong, the youngest in the family. Still an elementary schooler, her cheeks were chubby with baby fat. Youngguk patted Minjeong's head and said,

"Minjeong, you missed oppa a lot, didn't you."

Minjeong giggled and hugged him tightly. Before long, his mother and Yeonsu came out from the kitchen at the back of the shop.

"Honey!"

Yeonsu hugged him tightly with joy.

It had been five years since he married Yeonsu. Five years after publicly acknowledging their relationship, they got married. After their marriage, she had even waited for him during his military service, which made him feel even more grateful.

His mother watched the scene with a smile from behind.

"Mother, where's father?"

"It's not closing time for the side dish shop yet, so he must be there."

His mother and father were still running their businesses in Namhang. Even though their son had become a world-famous actor, they didn't want to leave Namhang.

Moreover, they saved every penny he gave them without spending it wastefully.

"Mother, Yeonsu and I will be back soon."

"Alright, alright. You two go quickly."

Yeonsu tried to say it was fine, but his mother and Jisoo pushed her out, with even Minjeong joining in without knowing the reason.

In the end, Yeonsu burst into laughter and had to leave the shop with Youngguk.

* * *

"I didn't do any work at all. Mother kept insisting that I shouldn't even get my hands wet, and Jisoo and Minjeong kept telling me to rest because I must be tired from filming the drama."

Yeonsu pouted with her lips sticking out. Finding her expression cute, Youngguk hugged her tightly.

Even though people were watching, he didn't care. After all, they were married. The merchants of Namhang Market looked at them warmly.

"Oppa, where are we going?"

"I'm thinking of visiting the place where we filmed before."

The place they walked to was the coastal cliff where they had filmed 'Man of August' and 'Mermaid Prince' in the past.

Confession.

It was also where he had confessed to his mother in the past. By now, weeds had grown thickly.

Without a word, Youngguk lay down on the spot. A seagull flying across the sky made eye contact with him.

The sea breeze blew, and the sound of the blue waves splashing continued to be heard. Yeonsu also lay down beside Youngguk, looking up at the sky.

"It's scratchy."

Perhaps because of the thick weeds, Yeonsu squirmed, and Youngguk hugged her again. He didn't mind the scratchiness. It reminded him of his father's scratchy beard when he rubbed his face against it as a child.

"Oppa, do you regret marrying me?"

"Why would I regret it?"

Youngguk kissed Yeonsu on the forehead. They were two people who had first met as child actors.

Now, they had grown up.

She was the woman who had awakened the feeling of love that he had never felt in his past life. If he hadn't met Yeonsu, it would have been difficult to awaken that feeling in this life as well.

How much time had passed?

By now, twilight was falling. The two stood up. It was midsummer, so only the cool sea breeze blew.

By the time they arrived back at Namhang Market, his father had already closed the side dish shop and was helping with the shop's work.

"Father!"

"Oh, Guk is here!"

His stepfather, Kim Sunghoon, hugged him tightly. He smelled of sweat from working at the side dish shop all day, but Youngguk didn't mind.

The six of them finished up at the shop and left Namhang Market. Youngguk held hands with Yeonsu, and his father, mother, Jisoo, and Minjeong walked with them.

Minjeong occasionally looked like she wanted to hold Youngguk's hand, but Jisoo told her not to disturb their time and held Minjeong's hand instead.

In the darkening alleys of Namhang Market, only the streetlights remained.

Walking through the maze-like alleys, Youngguk was lost in thought. From the time he hurriedly walked to set up the fish stall with his mother at dawn to the time he pulled a cart after twilight.

The difference now was that his family's laughter never ceased.

Following the streetlights of Namhang Market, the family talked endlessly about things they hadn't been able to say.

He believed that his father, watching from the sea, must also be smiling warmly.

Since they were not far from the sea, he believed his father was watching.

"Isn't that right, Father?"

At that moment,

Splash.

The sound of waves was heard.
