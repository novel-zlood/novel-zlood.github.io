Press Conference.

When a celebrity holds a press conference, it is usually because they are engulfed in scandal. Therefore, celebrities are notoriously afraid of the word "press conference."

Since their job is to sell fantasies, they are sensitive to public reactions.

It is, of course, the journalists who draw out these reactions from the public. A journalist’s pen becomes a gun barrel, and the sentences become bullets that sever the lives of celebrities.

“Tsk.”

Reporter Kwak Myunghwan licked his dry lips. He was someone who felt a sense of duty in his profession as a reporter.

Reporters fall into two categories. Even if they are at the same scene, one might become a war correspondent, while another writes tabloid trash.

Among them, the worst are the paparazzi who dig into celebrities' private lives and bite down on their weaknesses under the guise of investigative reporting.

The public loves sensational material. That's why the number of paparazzi has continued to increase like proliferating fruit flies.

The photos taken by these paparazzi are used in various ways. They are often used as smoke screens to cover political events, and there are frequent cases where they blackmail the celebrity's agency for money.

Of course, if the incidents involved drugs or sex scandals, it wouldn’t incite so much anger.

[Actor Jang Youngguk is scheduled to hold an official press conference regarding repeated dating rumors with actress Yeonsu. Both actors are currently starring in the MBS special mini-series 'Mermaid Prince.' Initially, both actors denied the dating rumors...]

Dating rumors were a different story altogether.

The anchor's voice on the television could be heard. The popularity of 'Mermaid Prince' was so overwhelming that it overshadowed all other terrestrial dramas.

Indeed, if you walked down the street, everyone, regardless of age, would be talking about 'Mermaid Prince.' It was a drama that created a national frenzy.

“Is he cornered?”

Kwak Myunghwan couldn't help but smile bitterly upon hearing the news of Youngguk's press conference.

As a reporter, he knew how reckless Youngguk's decision was.

Journalists are like hyenas. When a juicy prey appears, they devour it without leaving a single bone, much like bugs gnawing on grains.

“Hyung, what do you think?”

Clack.

A Go stone was placed soundly on the Go board. Even as time passed, the sound of the stones being placed echoed as if fishing for time.

Actor Ahn Junghyun, who had been looking down at the Go board, raised his head to look at Director Baek Janghoon.

“Hyung?”

“I’m thinking.”

“No, place the stone and then think.”

“Hmph.”

Director Baek Janghoon reluctantly placed a Go stone. Seeing this, Ahn Junghyun smiled faintly and immediately picked up a stone to respond.

The state of the Go board showed that Director Baek Janghoon was cornered.

“So what do you think, hyung? About Youngguk’s press conference.”

“As a public figure, holding a press conference once in a while is no big deal. Don’t make such a fuss.”

“It’s not easy not to make a fuss. Especially since there are many journalists looking to bring Youngguk down for even the slightest fault. He has more enemies than you’d think. Youngguk isn’t like the kids these days.”

It was well known that Youngguk was not friendly with journalists.

Since he was young, Youngguk had received praise for his acting. As he grew older, he became known not only in Korea but also throughout Asia and even Europe.

Other actors of his age did not shy away from interviews with journalists. They often used such opportunities to appeal to the public, fearing that their popularity might wane.

It was the struggle of those who didn’t want to end up as fleeting stars.

But Youngguk intentionally avoided interviews with journalists, maintaining a sense of mystique. He only sought recognition through a variety of roles in his acting career.

“I’m worried he’s cornered. He should have come to us for advice during times like this. You don’t keep connections just to let them go to waste. And I don’t understand CEO Songwon Kim either. Knowing Youngguk’s personality, he should’ve cut it off himself, not officially announced a press conference. You can’t gather spilled water back up.”

“Who says he’s cornered?”

Clack—!

At that moment, Director Baek Janghoon placed a Go stone loudly on the board. Actor Ahn Junghyun’s eyes widened. Despite being cornered, Director Baek Janghoon not only found a way out but also reversed the situation.

Seeing this, Director Baek Janghoon added,

“He’s probably planning a frontal breakthrough.”

Tremble, tremble.

Manager Lee Bongchun was soothing his trembling heart.

Finding even that difficult, he took out a calming pill.

“People might think you’re the one holding the press conference.”

“Youngguk, really, you should take one too. Seeing the journalists outside, my heart wouldn’t stop racing. Oh, boy.”

“If your heart stops, you die. It’s natural for it to beat.”

At Youngguk’s relaxed joke, Lee Bongchun let out a helpless laugh.

He was famous for not being nervous even on filming sets, but he never expected him to be this calm in a press conference packed with journalists.

“CEO, you’re here.”

Lee Bongchun bowed his head as CEO Kim Sunghwan entered the waiting room for the press conference.

CEO Kim Sunghwan also didn’t look pleased. As a representative of the agency, he wouldn’t welcome his actor holding a press conference.

“I’ve already contacted SW CEO Kim Sujin. They said they would leave it up to you, Youngguk. However, Yeonsu won’t be attending the press conference.”

They already knew Yeonsu couldn’t attend the press conference in person.

“The silver lining is that there are many people supporting both you and Yeonsu. It seems the drama had a significant impact. You two portray such a sweet couple in the drama.”

Of course, there would be repercussions. Extreme fans hate nothing more than their favorite actors dating.

“Manager Lee, did you give Youngguk the list of questions?”

“Well….”

“Manager Lee gave them to me, but I didn’t look at them.”

“What?”

A press conference isn’t something you do on a whim. The expected questions from journalists are usually sent to the agency in advance, and the agency and actor prepare suitable answers. It’s a mutual agreement.

“I didn’t look because I figured the journalists outside wouldn’t stick to the expected questions. They’ll surely ask some difficult questions. I don’t want to blame them, though. It’s an implicit agreement, not a strict rule.”

“Huh. Should I call this bold?”

It was something he had learned from past experience. Journalists sometimes asked questions outside of the expected ones, and those questions were often hard to answer.

“Youngguk, won’t you regret this?”

CEO Kim Sunghwan asked Youngguk, looking at him. As the agency representative, Kim Sunghwan always respected Youngguk’s opinions.

But he couldn’t help but worry about the press conference. He knew how much it could hurt them as individuals, beyond their roles as actors.

Youngguk left a remark to CEO Kim Sunghwan and moved forward.

“I think I’d regret it more if I hid it.”

* * *

It was a live broadcast press conference. Not all press conferences are broadcast live. This was proof of the high level of public interest.

Perhaps conscious of the live cameras, the journalists waited quietly for today’s main character without engaging in idle chatter.

“It’s Jang Youngguk.”

Someone spoke and quickly covered their mouth. Just as he said, Youngguk was stepping onto the podium of the press conference.

He was impeccably dressed in a suit, his hair neatly styled, and his face showed a relaxed demeanor.

The journalists were puzzled by Youngguk’s confident gaze. Usually, celebrities attending press conferences appeared haggard or visibly nervous.

“Mr. Jang Youngguk, I am Reporter Park Yongjin from ST Entertainment Magazine. Three months ago, when rumors about you and actress Yeonsu surfaced, both of you stated they were groundless. Can we assume that today’s press conference is also to deny the newly surfaced dating rumors?”

Youngguk looked at the reporter who had just asked him the first question.

The name was familiar. He had heard it from CEO Kim Sunghwan. To be precise, it was the name of a paparazzi.

The look in Park Yongjin’s eyes as he stared at Youngguk was clearly derisive.

A trap.

Youngguk knew what he was aiming for. Celebrities entangled in dating rumors typically deny them.

Park Yongjin likely expected the same. If Youngguk denied the rumors, he would bring up the photos he had.

This would inevitably draw the public’s fervent attention to his exclusive scoop.

“Just a moment.”

Youngguk raised his hand slightly.

“Before I answer Reporter Park Yongjin’s question, let me first greet the viewers watching this live broadcast. Hello, I am actor Jang Youngguk. First, I apologize for making you watch this press conference.”

The journalists, including Park Yongjin, smirked.

“However, let me briefly explain why I had no choice but to hold this press conference. Songwon Entertainment, which I belong to, and SW Entertainment, which actress Yeonsu belongs to, have been under continuous threat. The perpetrators include Reporter Park Yongjin, who just asked a question, along with several other journalists.”

The faces of the journalists, including Park Yongjin, who had been smirking until a moment ago, contorted. However, they had to struggle to fix their expressions because of the live broadcast cameras.

“Therefore, I decided to hold this press conference to clear up any doubts. Once again, I apologize to the viewers and will now start the press conference. Reporter Park Yongjin?”

“…Yes.”

“Could you repeat the question you just asked?”

Reporter Park Yongjin clenched his teeth and repeated the same question. Then he looked at Youngguk with a derisive smile again, as if daring him to give an answer.

“No.”

“Yes, as expected... Excuse me?”

“This press conference is not to deny the dating rumors.”

Park Yongjin, who had been confident just moments ago, looked as if he had seen a ghost. The other journalists also began to murmur.

They wondered if they had heard correctly or if there had been a mistake in expression. They murmured without paying attention to the live broadcast cameras.

At that moment, Youngguk raised his hand.

“Is there no next question?”

Like a fuse igniting, the murmuring journalists began raising their hands in a rush at Youngguk’s words.
