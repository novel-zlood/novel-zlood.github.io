Child Actor.

As is typical at any filming set, the waiting time is a continuous stretch of boredom. This is especially true for historical dramas.

Unlike contemporary dramas, historical dramas often require makeup and costume changes, leading to standby times that can be more than double the actual filming time. It was a case where the tail wagged the dog.

Most main and supporting actors waited in their vehicles, but many extras and minor roles would find a spot on the ground to take a nap.

"Suin, watch closely."

Youngguk was squatting and playing a traditional Korean game called "gongi." Opposite him sat a child actor dressed in a pink skirt and a jade-colored jacket.

As Youngguk quickly turned his hand, five small pebbles landed on the back of his hand.

"Wow—!"

The child actor, playing a trainee maid role and looking about ten years old, clapped her hands and cheered. Trying not to be outdone, the child attempted to play the game but couldn't manage to get five pebbles on the back of her hand like Youngguk.

Seeing the child actor looking disappointed, Youngguk patted her on the head and added,

"Oppa will teach you step by step."

"Really?"

"Before today's shoot ends, I'll make sure you can get five pebbles on the back of your hand. And if you still can't, oppa will teach you again next time."

At the promise of another lesson, the child actor beamed a bright smile.

The reason why Youngguk took care of the child actors this way was because he knew that the longer the standby time, the harder it was for child actors compared to adults.

Someone was watching this scene from a distance. It was none other than Park Sangcheol, the actor playing the eunuch Kim Choseon.

"Mr. Park, the standby time is getting long and boring, isn't it? Here, have a drink."

"Oh, thank you, Director Kim. But why suddenly ginger tea?"

"Ah, Youngguk brought it. He always brings it to the set so that the staff, who work hard from dawn, don't get stomachaches from an empty stomach. Isn't it amazing?"

Director Kim Dukhyeong nodded towards Youngguk, who was still playing gongi with the child actor.

"He's the lead, so he has a lot more scenes to shoot than others, which must be exhausting. But even during standby, he keeps himself busy. If there are child actors on set, he plays with them. He gets along well with the extras too. He even looks after the youngest staff members."

"Does Jang always do that? I thought it was just something his agency made him do."

"No way. I've known him since he was little; he's the real deal. I didn't want to sound old-fashioned, but Youngguk is different from those so-called rising stars nowadays. He's been like this since back in the day. In a way, wasn't he a child actor himself until a few years ago? I was amazed the first time I saw him."

"Why?"

"His face was tanned, and his hair looked like a chestnut, but he always brought a script and adapted to the filming set faster than most actors. I've been holding the camera at the broadcasting station for over twenty years, and I've never seen anyone like him. It's innate talent. Innate!"

The look in Park Sangcheol's eyes as he watched Youngguk changed. It was true that after a dispute at the Daehan Theater Festival, he hadn't held a favorable view of Youngguk. He thought Youngguk had only succeeded because of his natural talent.

But after coming to the filming set, that prejudice shattered in an instant.

The script Youngguk always carried was more worn out than the director's script, and he actively asked even minor actors how they performed in certain situations.

"Director, we don't have time to chat here. You need to check the tracks we've laid."

"Oh, I was just trying to have a little chat with Mr. Park, but here comes the nagger. Mr. Park, I'll go first. See you on set later. The ginger tea will get cold. Hurry up and drink it."

"Ah, yes."

The ginger tea in the paper cup was still warm. But actor Park Sangcheol couldn't even think of drinking it, as he licked his dry lips. He hesitated, wondering if he was worthy of receiving such kindness.

At the end of his gaze was Youngguk, patting the child actor's head.

"Scene number 39, the changed King Yeonsangun—!"

Kim Choseon, the head eunuch, felt puzzled by the recent changes in the king. It wasn't just because the king had abolished the state council for the past week.

He had served five kings, but few enjoyed the state council. After all, was it an easy task to argue with the ministers every time?

Unless it was a king like King Sejong, who, being highly learned, held the council to challenge his ministers.

-Do you mean for me to eat all of this?

At first, he thought the king was displeased with the side dishes served at dinner. But.

-The people struggle to eat even one meal a day, and yet I, who am called their father, eat so lavishly. What does that make me?

It was because there were too many dishes. Reducing the number of dishes on the king's table had never been done unless there was a major famine or war.

Moreover, knowing that the maids in the royal kitchen would eat the leftovers from his table.

-Leave it as it is.

The king seemed to deliberately eat less from the table. For Kim Choseon, who had served many kings, this was unusual behavior.

"Your Majesty, shall we proceed to the Geunjeongjeon Hall?"

Every morning, Kim Choseon assisted King Yeonsangun for the regular morning assembly. Just as they were about to walk past the palace courtyard.

"Let’s go this way today."

Suddenly, the king changed direction. As if taking a stroll, he began to explore the palace, causing the entourage to hurriedly follow him.

Unfortunately, due to the heavy rain the previous night, the ground was muddy.

The guards and maids looked worried, fearing the mud might splatter on the king's robes.

At that moment, a group of maids and young servant girls, who were walking in the opposite direction, stopped in their tracks. Normally, they wouldn't have encountered the king.

But all this happened because the king suddenly changed direction.

One of the maids, leading the group, hurriedly moved aside, bowing deeply to avoid obstructing the king's path. Just then.

"Oh, oh."

A young servant girl, still sleepy, tripped and fell. It was bad enough to make such a mistake in front of the king's entourage, but it didn't end there.

The girl lost her balance and fell into a muddy puddle. The mud splashed towards the king, causing the maid in charge of the group to turn pale.

'Of all times...!'

Kim Choseon swallowed his shock. The king's attire was sacred and inviolable. Even brushing against it could result in severe punishment.

The red dragon robe was splattered with mud. At that moment, King Yeonsangun walked towards the fallen servant girl.

Kim Choseon hurriedly moved, fearing the king might draw his sword and punish her.

"Are you alright?"

King Yeonsangun helped the fallen servant girl to her feet. Her small hands were covered in mud, but the king seemed unconcerned.

He even comforted her, fearing she might be scared. The maids and Kim Choseon watched in astonishment.

After sending the servant girls away, King Yeonsangun resumed his walk.

"Your Majesty, we should arrange for you to change into a clean robe."

"Leave it as it is."

'What?'

Kim Choseon almost questioned him. But King Yeonsangun, seemingly aware of his thoughts, continued walking towards Geunjeongjeon Hall, explaining,

"Head Eunuch, isn't it strange? When I reduce the number of dishes on my table, historians record it as if something significant had happened. And why do people make such a fuss over a little mud on my robe? Did you think I would draw my sword and punish that young servant girl? Ridiculous."

"······."

"Isn't it pitiful? To enter the palace at such a young age and live a life not of her choosing. If she were a nobleman's daughter, she would be waking up and greeting her parents at this time. But that child has to live her life with those small hands wet with water. Being a king makes many lives difficult."

"Your Majesty!"

Kim Choseon shouted in shock, as no one was supposed to say such things.

But King Yeonsangun, expecting this reaction, patted Kim Choseon on the shoulder and walked on. Then he added briefly,

"I don't care what the ministers think of my appearance during the morning assembly. So don't go looking to reprimand the girl who fell. How can a father of the nation not dirty his knees for his children?"

Click—!

Youngguk was taking a photo with a child actor. It was Suin, who had played the servant girl role. The child seemed deeply touched to take a photo with her favorite actor.

Suin’s mother, holding a film camera, approached Youngguk to express her gratitude.

"Mr. Youngguk, thank you so much. Suin said she really enjoyed your kindness on set."

"Really, Suin?"

Feeling shy, Suin nodded briefly. Her mother, looking pleased, added,

"She even printed a large photo of you and made it into a poster in her room."

"Oh, mom!"

Youngguk smiled faintly. Not all child actors are passionate about acting. Many are pressured by their parents to act against their will.

Even if they manage to perform well, not all of them grow up to have successful acting careers.

Think about it. There have been countless child actors, but how many have turned into successful adult actors?

"Suin, will you continue acting?"

"I'll do my best!"

Unlike many, Suin genuinely wanted to act. How could a senior actor not support such a child?

"By the way, Suin, did you take photos with everyone else? I heard from Minji and Yeonji that they took photos."

These were the names of other child actors who appeared briefly in the drama. After their scenes, they often took photos with the actors. But not all actors took photos with the child actors.

"I want to, but... I'm too scared..."

"Scared? Of whom?"

"Mr. Kim Choseon."

Suin whispered. Understandably, actor Park Sangcheol's appearance, playing Kim Choseon, could be intimidating to a child.

Moreover, apart from meal times, he was always engrossed in his script, so they probably hadn't interacted much.

Youngguk then held Suin's small hand and said,

"Shall we go together?"

Actor Park Sangcheol widened his eyes at the sudden appearance of Youngguk and the child actor. Before he could say anything, Youngguk bowed.

"Senior, can we take a photo together?"

"P-please, senior!"

The child actor also hurriedly bowed, eyes wide like a startled rabbit. Park Sangcheol couldn't help but laugh at the adorable sight.

Suin, the child actor, was surprised by Park Sangcheol’s smile. She whispered to Youngguk,

"Mr. Kim Choseon smiled."
