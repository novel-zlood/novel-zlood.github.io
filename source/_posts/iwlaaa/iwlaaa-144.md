"Jang Youngguk, an actor!"

The reporter's voice is more enthusiastic than ever.

It is an interview shoot for the movie "Outlaw."

Not only in Chungmuro but also in the broadcasting industry, Baek Janghoon's team is renowned. Getting an interview with the filming team is harder than plucking stars from the sky.

"The news that you took on an unexpected villain role has garnered significant attention."

Among actors, there is an unspoken rule. To run on the road to success, a drastic image change can be more harmful than beneficial.

Thus, there was much talk about Youngguk's choice of a villain role.

After all, it's not just any ordinary villain role. It's a role of a chaebol heir with an arrogant and rude personality, not someone who commits murder for their beliefs.

"Some say that your bold image transformation marks you as a candidate to lead the future of Korean cinema. What are your thoughts on this?"

Some also said it was a result of arrogance and conceit. Just because you are an actor doesn't mean you need to transform your image unconditionally.

Building a structure requires solid groundwork. If you change your image haphazardly, you might end up being nothing at all.

"This is your first formal collaboration with Director Baek Janghoon since your cameo appearance as a child actor. How do you feel about it?"

He is usually a kind-hearted grandfather, but on set, he is known to be the most strict.

Such is the nature of being a film director. A single moment of scene transition and direction determines the course of the film, so they are always on edge.

No matter how grand a cruise ship is, a moment of negligence can lead it to an iceberg.

From Director Baek Janghoon's perspective, he is the captain steering a cruise ship with numerous crew members aboard.

"Excuse me, Jang Youngguk-ssi...?"

The reporter looks puzzled. All he can think of is how much he wants to end this tedious interview quickly.

Even though he has removed the stitches from his palm, it still throbs. To clear his mind, there's nothing better than reading the script.

At that moment, Son Hwawon, who is sitting next to him, nudges him with his elbow.

"Yes?"

"Oh, you haven't said anything for a while. Did I make you uncomfortable somehow...?"

"Oh, I'm sorry. Let's start the interview again from the beginning."

He thought he had answered out loud, but it seems he only answered in his head.

Since taking on the character of Jung Haesuk in the script, this phenomenon has been recurring. He hasn't been able to respond properly to others' questions, and instead, there have been more condescending looks. Almost as if he had really become Jung Haesuk.

* * *

"Phew, that was intense."

The PD who wrapped up the interview shoot shakes his head. It was a short interview shoot of just thirty minutes.

Finding Baek Janghoon's filming set is as difficult as finding a pearl in the mud. That's how rare it is to get permission for an interview shoot.

Moreover, isn't this film drawing significant public attention with its cast of high-profile actors?

"Mijin-ssi, is Jang always like that? I got goosebumps all over during the interview. His eyes looked so cold. Didn't you say you interviewed him once before?"

"It was a few years ago, but back then..."

It was during the drama "Youth." He was known as the nation's first love, portraying a high school student filled with the fragrance of youth. Not cold and ruthless like now.

But today, even asking simple questions was difficult.

'It's not like he was insincere in his answers.'

Some actors occasionally dislike interviews altogether. Although they thrive on public attention, top stars often find it bothersome.

However, in Youngguk's case, it wasn't mere annoyance. The person himself felt cold. It was as if he had become a completely different person from when he filmed "Youth" years ago.

"Anyway, Jang Youngguk and Son Hwawon together."

It's no exaggeration to say that the hottest actors in their 20s in Korea have come together.

Moreover, the person holding the megaphone is none other than the legendary director Baek Janghoon, a legend in Chungmuro.

"There's a consensus that this film is going to be a huge hit. Didn't they also say we could do a brief sketch of the filming set?"

"Yes, that's what I heard."

"What are you going to do, Mijin-ssi? The interview is over, and it's just me and the camera director left to do the sketch."

"I'll stay too."

As a reporter in the broadcasting industry, finding Baek Janghoon's filming set is an extraordinary stroke of luck. Missing this opportunity means she can't guarantee when she'll have another chance.

Moreover, the image of an actor she faced during today's interview keeps lingering in her mind.

* * *

"Jang, should I help you with your lines?"

He is an older actor, playing the role of Chairman Wang, Jung Haesuk's father in the script. Youngguk deeply bows his head in gratitude.

"Thank you very much, sir."

He is as respected on set as Director Baek Janghoon. He has built his career by traversing Chungmuro since his youth.

However, on set, he is always the first to arrive, and even if the waiting time is long, he never complains. Thus, other actors couldn't dare to complain about long standby times.

The two spend a long time rehearsing their lines with the script. Even though the script is worn out, and the short directions are imprinted in their minds, they don't let it go.

After a while, the older actor, who had been rehearsing from the beginning to the end of the scene, smiles contentedly.

"Goodness, I felt this on set too, but there's nothing for me to teach you."

"No, sir. I still have much to learn."

"Really, I'm not just saying this. There's nothing to teach."

The older actor looks at the filming set and adds.

"Was your sensitivity lately all because of me?"

"……."

"Looks like I unknowingly showed it. Now that my character is disappearing from the script, my heart felt restless. Moreover, I'm retiring after this film..."

In the script, exiting means the death of the character. For non-lead roles, one must always be prepared to exit the script.

However, actors are also human, and saying goodbye to a beloved character is never easy.

Especially since the older actor declared his retirement after this film.

"I think I started my acting career at about your age, Jang. Back then, I was just a naive kid. I came to Seoul from the countryside, hoping to make a name in films, and roamed Chungmuro endlessly. A clueless kid who knew nothing about acting, I knocked on Chungmuro's doors so much that one assistant director took pity on me and gave me a minor role. But after that minor role, I caught the directors' eyes and started to succeed."

His wrinkled eyes deepen as if reminiscing about the past.

"Now that I'm older, I regret how lazy and arrogant I was in my youth. The rural boy who came to Seoul disappeared, and I became an actor full of pride, nagging juniors and scolding assistant directors for long standby times."

It's an image hard to imagine now.

"In hindsight, I realized all of it was my fault. When I first met you, Jang, I was worried. I wondered if you were like my younger self. But as time passed, I realized you are different from me. You're not just a talented actor; your hard work is deeply ingrained in your shadow. Others might not see it, but you can't fool my eyes."

The older actor had a vague understanding of how much effort Youngguk had put into living as an actor.

Most people saw the young Youngguk as a genius actor with natural talent.

But in the eyes of the older actor, Youngguk appeared to be someone who worked harder than anyone else.

"You will be great. You're already famous, but you'll do even better."

"You're too kind, sir."

At that moment, raindrops begin to fall on the filming set.

Looking at the raindrops, the older actor continues.

"Let's go. It's an honor to have my last shoot with you."

* * *

Drip, drip.

The raindrops become heavier. The summer monsoon cools down the heat.

The rain pours down so heavily that no water truck is needed, and the filming camera focuses on the scene. Just like the eyes of a detective chasing a criminal.

"Haesuk, what is happening!"

People gather in the VIP ward of Jeongil Hospital. They are executives of Jeongil Group.

Among them, the president of Jeongil Food, Kim Mincheol (uncle-in-law), approaches with a shocked face. He must have come in such a hurry that raindrops have seeped into his shoulders, creating shadows.

"He suddenly collapsed."

The executives murmur. After all, the collapse of Chairman Wang of Jeongil Group is a major event. It hasn't been reported in the media due to the embargo, but if it were, it would cause a significant uproar in Korea.

At that moment, even the aunt appears. President Kim Mincheol of Jeongil Food, as if realizing it's time, tries to enter the ward with his wife. But.

"You can't go in."

"What?"

"The doctor says he needs absolute rest. So please leave."

Kim Mincheol looks at his wife for help. Chairman Wang is already of old age. It wouldn't be surprising if he suddenly died in his hospital bed due to his chronic illness.

In such a situation, if he suddenly passed away without leaving a will, the aftermath would be predictable.

Kim Mincheol's wife, who is also Jung Haesuk's aunt, strides forward with her eyes wide open.

"Even if it's anyone else, I must see my brother. Haesuk, you stop too!"

At that moment.

Crunch.

Jung Haesuk grabs his aunt's shoulder with one hand, his eyes glinting.

"I told you to leave, didn't I?"

Jung Haesuk's nature is already well-known within Jeongil Group. His temperament is so similar to that of Chairman Wang, who once caused a sibling feud to take over Jeongil Group.

The elders often said that Jung Haesuk reminded them of Chairman Wang in his younger days, so much so that it was uncanny.

Cold-hearted and sometimes even cruel to his own blood, that was Chairman Wang.

Drip, drip.

Heavy rain noisily hits the window of the hospital room. But even that sound is drowned out by the various machine noises.

The hospital bed where Chairman Wang lies is connected to numerous life-support devices. It shows the determination to keep him alive at all costs.

Jung Haesuk visits the hospital room alone.

"Father, showing such a weak side allows the parasites to seize the opportunity."

Jung Haesuk looks down at his father lying in the hospital bed. His face reveals the traces of time with clear wrinkles and more pronounced age spots.

Jung Haesuk speaks as if confessing.

"I've learned a lot from you since I was young. You always pushed me to toughen up, saying I was too weak to inherit the vast Jeongil Group."

Chairman Wang was an inherently greedy person. That's why he could stand alone at the top, pushing aside his siblings.

Desire is like an endless well. No matter how much water you pour, it can never be filled.

Consumed by this deep and vast desire, he never let go of his management rights even as he grew old and ill.

"But I'm really curious."

Jung Haesuk's lips twist. He leans forward, looking cruelly at his father lying in the hospital bed.

"Did you really think you wouldn't lose your position to such a weak child?"
