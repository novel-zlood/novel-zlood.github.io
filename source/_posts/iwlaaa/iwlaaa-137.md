Seagull.

I don't understand.

I used to think that the most important thing for an actor when taking on a role was their acting ability.

It's a bit embarrassing for me to say this, but is there anyone among my peers who has more acting experience than I do?

As if he read my thoughts, Go Gwangtae continued speaking.

"Jang, you act well, that's an undeniable fact. Even someone like me, who knows nothing about acting, could see that you were born with talent. But here's the thing."

"......"

"You don't seem like a novice actor. Just because you started as a child actor doesn't mean you should have that level of acting skill at your age. If all child actors could act like you, they would have swept all the film festivals in Korea. If most actors climb the stairs step by step, it feels like you've already experienced all the ups and downs and choose your roles like a seasoned veteran."

A seasoned veteran, indeed. I've seen everything there is to see in the broadcasting world and Chungmuro. It's true that I've become more cautious when choosing projects.

"Director Baek Janghoon probably didn't offer you a role for a similar reason. You need to take on a variety of roles while you're still young, but you only aim for difficult roles, and just one specific type. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

"The main role..."

"That's right. Although I haven't known you for long, when I looked at your filmography, something felt off."

Go Gwangtae scratched his messy hair and continued.

"It's like you're testing your own acting skills."

It felt like cold water was being poured over my head.

Maybe it's because of my past life. Haven't I lived my entire life as a supporting actor?

That's why when I decided to live as an actor again, I wanted to be the best at acting more than anyone else.

Naturally, I didn't even look at supporting roles, and my eyes were fixed on leading roles.

"And crucially, none of the characters in my script match you as the protagonist."

* * *

Baek Janghoon Production.

In front of a building with a crystal-like reflective exterior, people in suits gather in small groups.

The scene is reminiscent of Yeouido's stock market. Like those who knocked on the stock market doors to buy stocks expected to hit the upper limit, these people also have urgency written on their faces.

"I'd like to meet Director Baek Janghoon just once. I'm the CEO of SQ Entertainment."

"Do you have an appointment?"

"Ahem, I haven't received any contact."

"I'm sorry."

"No, I said I'm Wang Junghyun from SQ Entertainment!"

The receptionist sighed internally. She had lost count of how many times this had happened.

After rumors spread about Director Baek Janghoon's next project, Chungmuro was buzzing.

Various entertainment agency CEOs had shown up out of the blue, wanting to meet Director Baek Janghoon.

This was mild compared to some. There were even people who appeared with briefcases full of 10,000 won bills.

"Ugh."

The receptionist unintentionally let out a sigh, and the man glared at her.

"Did you just sigh? Do you think I'm some random peddler? I said I'm Wang Junghyun from SQ Entertainment! I've met Director Baek Janghoon several times in person. I came because I changed my phone number and couldn't contact him. We've even played golf together. So, call him right now and tell him Wang Junghyun is here. He'll tell you to send me up immediately."

"If you're that close, you should contact him directly and make an appointment!"

The receptionist's raised voice made the man's face turn red and blue.

People standing in the back started to glance over, sensing a potential fight. They were also entertainment agency CEOs who had come to see Director Baek Janghoon. At that moment,

"That's strange."

The receptionist's face suddenly brightened.

"Did I ever play golf with you?"

The sudden voice made the man turn his head back. His eyes widened in shock. It was none other than Director Baek Janghoon standing there.

The man's face quickly changed from red and blue to a polite expression.

"Director Baek Janghoon, I'm from SQ Entertainment..."

"Don't make a scene. This isn't a marketplace. Raising your voice won't solve anything. If you want to meet me, make an official appointment."

"Uh, but could I at least get your number?"

It turned out he didn't even know Director Baek Janghoon's contact information. The receptionist smirked as if she had expected it.

Most of the people who caused such a fuss at the production office were like that.

Then, Director Baek Janghoon, looking unusually displeased, asked again.

"Are you still here?"

When the great figure of Chungmuro glared like a tiger, even a well-known entertainment agency CEO had no choice but to tuck his tail and leave in a hurry. Others did the same.

As Director Baek Janghoon, looking visibly upset, scanned the lobby, the crowd dispersed like flies, avoiding his gaze and walking away.

"Mi Hyun-ssi, I'm sorry. There have been a lot of incidents like this lately, haven't there?"

"No, Director."

"By the way, is that person already here?"

"He arrived an hour ago. He didn’t want to bother you, so he asked me not to contact you separately."

Director Baek Janghoon smiled warmly and nodded briefly.

After taking the elevator to the floor where the CEO's office was, a young man was waiting in front of the office door.

His skin was as fair and smooth as that of a beautiful actress.

As soon as he met Director Baek Janghoon's eyes, he stood up and bowed deeply like a country dog.

"You wanted to meet me?"

He was an actor Director Baek Janghoon had known for a while. Once considered a blue chip in Chungmuro, he had been very popular.

Though he didn't know how the actor got his contact information, he had received a sudden call last night.

Initially, he didn't plan to meet him, but the earnestness in his voice over the phone was different from other actors.

And after looking at his filmography, he felt a curious interest as a director.

"Yes, Director. I really wanted to meet you."

"Alright, let's go in."

Director Baek Janghoon and the young man entered the CEO's office. The young man was none other than actor Son Hwawon.

Seagulls circle in the air.

Seohae's Jeongok Port looks different from Namhang.

There’s no white sandy beach, and the dock is filled with yachts instead of fishing boats. But the crashing waves are the same.

The salty air stings my nose, bringing me back to my senses.

"Hooah."

I left Sillim-dong and headed straight to Jeongok Port. I wanted to go down to Busan, but I didn't have the time.

Moreover, my mother would definitely worry if her son, who had come to Seoul, suddenly showed up at home.

-And crucially, none of the characters in my script match you as the protagonist.

Go Gwangtae's last words kept echoing in my mind. At some point, I became fixated on the idea that I had to be the protagonist.

This deeply rooted thought started to affect my choice of projects.

Even when numerous synopses flooded into my agency, I wouldn't consider them unless they were for leading roles.

"I've become quite arrogant."

Thinking about when all these synopses started coming to me, it was probably after the airing of "Youth."

After earning the undeserved title of "the nation's first love," I continued to appear on both the screen and the TV.

As a rookie actor, I even won an award at the Korea Drama Festival. How could I not be?

"Outlaw."

I muttered the title of the script. It was the debut work of Go Gwangtae, once called the madman of Chungmuro, which never saw the light of day.

But just as I had changed, the fate of the script also changed. The fact that Director Baek Janghoon, a master of Chungmuro, had decided to take the helm was already a significant development.

"Youngguk!"

At that moment, a large man came running with a black plastic bag in his hand. From a distance, he looked more like a talking bear than a person, given his imposing physique.

"Hyung, you got here quickly."

"Geez, what's going on that you had to come all the way to Seohae? I rushed here thinking something serious had happened."

"My mind is just a bit cluttered."

"Is it because of your next project?"

I've been working with my manager, Lee Bongchun, for several years now. At first, I wasn't sure if he would be a good manager, but now he understands me better than anyone.

Then, Manager Lee Bongchun took a beer can out of the black plastic bag.

"Here, drink up."

"Hyung, I have to drive."

"Hey, I took a taxi here. I'll drive for you, so don't worry. When your mind is cluttered, you need to drink a cold beer and let it all out. Just chug it."

How could I refuse when he's so insistent?

The coldness of the beer can rushed in as I took a gulp. The fizz bursting in my mouth felt more refreshing than ever.

Looking at the setting sun, I said,

"Hyung, I want my next project to be Director Baek's work."

"Director Baek Janghoon? I heard from the CEO that he doesn't intend to cast you."

"Not as the main character."

The plot of "Outlaw" was simple.

At the Judicial Research and Training Institute, many legal professionals live and work together. Among them, some receive scholarship offers from large corporations.

The criteria for this are not just academic excellence but also how far removed they are from the ideals of a legal professional.

A corrupt prosecutor, who has been engaging in legal malpractices, one day opens his eyes to justice.

He wages a life-and-death battle against a conglomerate he once considered his ally and realizes his own weakness.

There's a role that ruthlessly crushes this protagonist.

It's none other than an arrogant supporting character, who resembles a gangster. He resolves conflicts with either force or money, regardless of who the opponent is.

The character is a chaebol heir who fights a life-and-death battle with the protagonist.

"The story is about a prosecutor fighting against a conglomerate. The antagonist is the only son of a chaebol chairman, a second-generation chaebol. The title 'Outlaw' could refer to either the protagonist or the antagonist. Unlike the roles I’ve played so far, this character doesn't protect justice. Instead, he commits crimes daily, uses foul language, and is essentially a wealthy thug."

The sun was setting. The blue waves beyond the dock turned reddish as they absorbed the sunset.

I placed the empty beer can down with a loud clink and said,

"I want to try playing that role."
