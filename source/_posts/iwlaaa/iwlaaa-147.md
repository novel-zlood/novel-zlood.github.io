-Young Lady, when are you planning to come back?

The voice of the butler came through the receiver. Just from the voice alone, it was clear. You could tell that between the crinkled wrinkles, there was a lot of worry.

Of course, as the eldest granddaughter of the Rossellini family and the chief designer who would lead Desiderio in the future, she had already been staying in an unknown country in Asia for fifteen days.

"Grandpa, it looks like it will take a little more time."

- The company is in chaos. Because you suddenly left, the preparation process for Elfo stellato is experiencing difficulties. For the sake of those who remain, please return as soon as possible, Young Lady.

Monica hung up the phone and leaned back on the sofa. She didn't think it would be easy.

However, she didn't expect it to be this difficult either. No matter how globally famous an actor might be, they eventually bow their heads in front of the name of Desiderio.

But the young actor from Asia still hadn't given a clear answer.

"That's why he's even more attractive."

The image of Youngguk she encountered at the filming site was enough to make Monica's heart flutter.

It wasn't that she felt attracted to him as a man. After seeing the confession of the priest, it kept circling in her mind. Why was this Asian actor so captivating to her?

But she couldn't find a clear answer.

"It was quite the commotion."

Because of that, when Monica first proposed selecting an Asian actor as Desiderio's exclusive model, the company strongly opposed it.

The reason was that he lacked too many qualities to be the future leader of Desiderio.

If it were an ordinary luxury brand, it wouldn't have been like this. But Desiderio is a place known for serving only the upper class recognized worldwide.

Jang Youngguk.

He might be famous in a country called Korea, but globally, he was just a minor actor in Hollywood.

Desiderio proposing an exclusive model contract to a minor actor in Hollywood was akin to a black person being elected as the head of the White House. It was that nonsensical.

But once she met him in person, she could understand.

"Vino."

It means wine in Italian. Like how wine matures in oak barrels and reaches its peak after decades in a bottle.

Jang Youngguk was the same. Surely, as time passes, more people will recognize his value, just like she does now.

It was then.

"We're ready."

It was her secretary, Giordana. At his voice, Monica stood up.

Her silver hair swayed, reflecting the sunlight, making it look exceptionally bright.

* * *

"Youngguk, are you really not interested?"

Manager Lee Bongchun glanced at the rearview mirror and asked. He seemed curious too.

After all, wasn't it already a well-known fact within the agency? That Desiderio's chief designer came to Korea to meet Youngguk.

"Is the president asking you to ask?"

Manager Lee Bongchun rubbed his nose. It was an action he often did when his intentions were revealed.

President Kim Seonghwan must be anxious too. For an ordinary actor, refusing Desiderio's offer was unthinkable.

No, even for a globally famous actor, it would be the same.

"These days, there seem to be a lot of calls to the agency, asking if it's true. That designer woman even showed up at the filming site, causing a stir. They're just fishing for a story to write an article."

"How did the president respond?"

"He said it's baseless. If Youngguk changes his mind and refuses, we don't know how they'll react. He's worried about the potential embarrassment."

If Youngguk were selected as Desiderio's exclusive model, Korea would be abuzz again.

To exaggerate, the Asian fashion market might even be shaken. Desiderio had never selected an Asian as an exclusive model before.

That's why President Kim Seonghwan couldn't easily provide any information to reporters. If Youngguk refused the offer, it was uncertain how Desiderio would react.

In terms of business scale and influence, comparing Desiderio and Songwon Entertainment was like comparing an elephant to an ant.

"I still have time, so I'll think about it a bit more."

It was a courtesy from Desiderio. If he didn't like the contract terms or wanted to add special conditions, he was given a month to decide.

That's why it was even more puzzling.

Why me?

There was a story that a top Hollywood actress once proposed to become Desiderio's model, but Desiderio refused, saying she didn't fit their image.

That's why it was hard to understand why Desiderio was so fervently pursuing him.

It's true that he had played leading roles several times and was known to the public. But that was limited to Korea.

Even if you broaden the scope, it might extend to Japan. Globally, he was just a small actor from Asia.

"No matter how I see it, Youngguk, you're too cautious."

"I think it's because I'm getting older."

"Oh my, anyone would think you're middle-aged."

Youngguk swallowed a bitter smile. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that his past experiences made him this cautious about everything.

Having been betrayed by people he trusted and relied on, he eventually couldn't trust anyone. That's why he kept his distance from human relationships.

Just in time, the van arrived at the filming site.

What's with the atmosphere?

The atmosphere at filming sites is usually similar. Staff bustling around to stand by, assistant directors gathering for meetings under the director, and actors engrossed in memorizing scripts.

But today's atmosphere was different. Everyone seemed excited about something.

"Youngguk, thank you!"

The first to react was the assistant director. As soon as he saw Youngguk arriving at the filming site, he ran up and thanked him.

And the assistant director was just the beginning. From the youngest staff who couldn't even make eye contact due to the character he played, to the usually quiet sound director and lighting director.

What are they thanking me for?

It was when he was bewildered. Director Baek Janghoon and cinematographer Do Jangwook approached.

"Youngguk, why did you prepare such expensive things? Considering you gave them to all the juniors, it must be well over a hundred."

Gifts?

"Jangwook, you like it the most."

"Brother, ahem. I have my pride. Let's have a gathering today. Youngguk tried to lift the filming site's mood with his gift. It'd be a shame to just let it pass."

"Anyone would think you're paying for the gathering. Youngguk, if you're going to give such gifts next time, at least let me know in advance. Everyone seems to like it, so I won't say more, but I heard they're very expensive, and I'm worried."

It didn't take long to find out the cause of this commotion. High-end wallets from Desiderio had been sent to the filming site as gifts, in Youngguk's name.

* * *

"What happened?"

As soon as he finished filming, Youngguk went straight to find Monica. It was at a hotel near Gwanghwamun.

Luckily, there was a private business room. If they had met in the hotel lobby, it would have been troublesome. Not only because he was a famous actor but also because she had an appearance that drew attention wherever she went.

Monica took a sip of tea and answered.

"In Italy, there's a saying. Show sincerity to the person you like, and don't spare anything for the person you love. I gave gifts because I like you, Youngguk."

An Italian with a mustache translated for her.

Are all Italians this straightforward? Even if she planned to give gifts, shouldn't she have asked him first?

Especially when the gifts were not cheap, and there were over a hundred to match the staff and main actors.

As if reading his mind, Monica added.

"And those wallets are all basic lines, so they're not that expensive. Desiderio isn't primarily a wallet maker. Just think of it as my sincerity."

"How much are they?"

"The most basic model starts at a thousand dollars."

The translator answered for her. Hearing the price, he couldn't help but be surprised. In Korean currency, the cheapest one was over a million won. Just simple math meant over a hundred million won.

Moreover, higher-end products were given to senior staff and main actors.

"I'll pay for them."

He ended up spending a considerable sum, but he had no choice. Monica's gesture was one with a purpose.

But she looked at him with curious eyes, tilting her head as if she found his words unexpected.

"How fascinating. Are all Asians like you, Youngguk? So skeptical even when shown goodwill? Don't take it the wrong way. I genuinely wanted to express my sincerity, not to make you uncomfortable or be rude."

"You did it because you want me as an exclusive model. I find it hard to understand why you're so persistent. If it's Desiderio, even famous Hollywood actors or top models would jump at the chance."

The translator hesitated for a moment, seemingly unfamiliar with the term "jump at the chance." But he managed to continue the conversation.

Monica listened to him, then pondered for a moment before speaking with her alluring lips.

"Since I was young, I've always gotten what I wanted. But as a designer, this is the first time I've felt this way. I always thought the stories of European designers having their own muses were lies. But seeing you on screen, I realized you could be my muse. And coming to Korea confirmed it."

He had nothing to say. It was embarrassing.

"I am willing to meet any of your conditions. Initially, I planned to win your heart, but it seems I don't have much time left. The company is urging me to return soon. Giordana."

At Monica's call, her secretary, Giordana, approached.

Giordana handed Monica the documents she had prepared in advance.

"Don't think I'm being materialistic. This seems to be the only way to convey my sincerity to someone I've just met."

Monica handed over the documents. Youngguk looked at them with a puzzled expression.

Wasn't it the model's exclusive contract? He had received it before. What had changed?

Since it was in English, it took time to read.

But what caught his eye was the changed contract amount.
