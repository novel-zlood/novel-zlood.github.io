I have no interest in celebrities. This was true even during my school days. While my friends in school uniforms were passionately discussing celebrities, I could barely count on one hand the ones I knew.

While my peers laminated photos of their favorite actors to use as book covers, I used plain-colored ones. Instead of celebrity posters on my room wall, I had the five characters "Korean University" stuck up like a motivational slogan.

“Jaehee, I heard actor Jang Youngguk is entering your department this time?”

Her mother excitedly asked. But Shin Jaehee, who was drying her short hair, just nodded briefly without elaborating further.

Her mother continued to rave about actor Jang Youngguk, from the dramas he appeared in to the movies. It was clear that her mother was a fervent fan of Jang Youngguk.

When her daughter showed no particular response, she even grabbed her hands and pleaded.

“Jaehee, please get me just one autograph from Jang Youngguk for your mom.”

“Mom, I have to go to school early today to prepare for orientation. We'll talk later. And why don't you ask dad instead of me?”

“Well, your dad...”

Her still-damp hair fluttered in the wind. What was so great about actor Jang Youngguk that she was making such a fuss? He was just an actor, after all.

In Shin Jaehee's mind, the job of an actor could be defined in one line: someone who acts on the TV screen or in movies. Nothing more, nothing less.

‘Well, I heard he’s good at studying too.’

Of course, it was surprising to learn that he was the top student entering the law department this year, but that was it.

After all, didn't Shin Jaehee also enter the law department of Korean University as the top student three years ago?

“We will now begin the orientation for the Korean University law department…!”

Jaehee stopped speaking abruptly as the back door of the lecture hall suddenly opened. She widened her eyes when she saw the man who entered through the door.

‘What is this...’

He looked so much better in person compared to the photos her mother had shown. His broad shoulders, flawless skin, and high nose drew all attention to him.

Jaehee quickly collected herself, feeling an inexplicable aura surrounding him that made the phrase "an actor is an actor" resonate.

“Why are you so slow even though you're late! Hurry up and sit down.”

Sigh.

“You're a new law student, right? Why are you all staring with your mouths open just because your classmate is handsome? Think about how sad your senior brothers here would be. Now, focus!”

But she inadvertently let slip the word “handsome” in her subsequent words. Fortunately, no one seemed to notice.

Jaehee quickly erased her thoughts. After all, though he was a new law student, he was not someone related to her. Given that his main job was acting, the possibility of him taking the bar exam was very low.

“There's no solution because of the lack of self-reflection. That phrase has been lingering in my heart. Jang Youngguk, do you still think that way?”

Professor Shin Jeonggil, the department head, asked, making Jaehee's eyes widen. It was unbelievable to think he gave such an answer during an oral interview on judicial justice.

But what was more surprising was Jang Youngguk's answer.

“I confirmed it for sure after coming here today.”

“What did you confirm?”

“That one loach can muddy the entire river.”

Jaehee's face flushed involuntarily. As the student association president, she was supposed to oversee the students, but she had already clashed with a senior on the first day of orientation.

It was clear who Jang Youngguk meant by "loach" in a narrow sense. The senior she had clashed with was turning red and blue.

Moreover, his answer to the follow-up question about whether it would be enough to get rid of the loach was remarkable.

“It means that fish growing up in muddy water might mistakenly believe themselves to be loaches.”

Jaehee's view of actor Jang Youngguk began to change.

* * *

The new students, resembling ducklings following their mother duck, were exploring the law building in groups of three, guided by upperclassmen.

In a manner similar to forming military buddy teams, they were divided into groups of three from their seats. Coincidentally, except for me, the other two new students in my group were all female.

As we were being shown around, unsure if they were more interested in the school or in me, a senior spoke up.

“This is Ulpianus Hall, where you’ll be studying. You might not come here often in your first year as the curriculum is focused on general subjects, but take a look around. Though it’s only four years, if you stay longer, you might end up here for five or six years. At first, the building might look beautiful and exotic, but you’ll soon find it tiresome as you come here too often.”

Named after the ancient Roman jurist, Ulpianus Hall looked more like a Western-style building rather than a department building. It seemed like an effort was made to give it the feel of an ancient temple.

At that moment.

“Attention everyone!”

As we were about to enter Ulpianus Hall, another senior suddenly appeared.

He cleared his throat a few times as if he had been waiting for us and put on a playful expression.

“As you heard in the orientation lecture, a question will be given at each building. The group that answers the most questions correctly will win an exemption from the upcoming MT fee, so give it your best. Now, here’s the question.”

It was a question related to law. Of course, since the new students didn’t know much about law, the level was low.

Moreover, since they had entered the law department of Korean University, they were recognized as top students nationwide. There was even a joke that law students from Daechi-dong started preparing for the bar exam from their first year. Anyway.

‘I’m not planning to attend the MT.’

Fortunately, before I could step in, the two new students in my group answered all the questions. They seemed to be the rumored students from Daechi-dong.

They answered so quickly that even the senior who asked the question looked surprised.

At every building named after famous jurists like Ulpianus, Jhering, and Jellinek, a question was given.

The two new students in my group were intensely focused on solving the questions, almost as if they were competing with each other.

When we finally arrived in front of the building named after Astraea, the goddess of law and justice.

“There are many new students who have done advanced studies this year. There are three other teams besides this one that have answered three questions correctly in a row. It wasn’t like this during our time.”

The student association president, Shin Jaehee, came out shaking her head. It seemed like she was the one to ask the final question.

The other three teams, who had arrived around the same time, were already fired up. Since all teams were tied, the one that answered the final question first would win.

“Since it’s the final question, raise your hand and answer if you know it. Don’t just raise your hand blindly. The difficulty of the question is higher than the previous ones. If no one answers the final question correctly, all four teams will be treated as second place, and there will be no first place.”

Since there was no prize for second place, it seemed the exemption from the MT fee was out of reach.

Shin Jaehee then asked the final question. Unlike the earlier general knowledge law questions, this one was about a civil law case, indicating the increased difficulty.

‘How can a new student answer that?’

She recited a precedent and asked for the relevant civil law article, something even many undergraduate students might struggle to answer.

After all, they were students who had been studying for the college entrance exams just a few months ago.

At that moment, one of the female students in my group raised her hand.

“According to Article 2, Paragraph 1, and Article 750 of the Civil Code, we should focus on determining whether the act of obstructing sunlight due to building construction is considered a legally wrongful act under civil law.”

Huh.

I had forgotten that there were Daechi-dong kids here. If they aimed to enter the law department of Korean University, they likely did some advanced studies in law. Daechi-dong’s academic fervor was renowned nationwide.

The female student who answered looked triumphant, occasionally glancing at me as if to showcase her intelligence.

Even Shin Jaehee appeared surprised. However, she hadn’t declared the answer yet.

“I didn’t expect anyone to memorize the law articles, but today’s new students are something else. But you’re only half correct.”

A look of bewilderment crossed the female student’s face. She then briefly glanced at the senior standing next to the president.

The senior looked flustered and pretended not to know, nodding slightly. They seemed to have known each other beforehand. I knew it.

“It seems none of the new students know the full answer?”

At that moment.

“I know the answer.”

The reason I knew the answer was simple. While preparing for the oral interview, I had reviewed civil law precedents just in case.

Some law professors were known to ask about civil or criminal law precedents, so I had heard.

Of course, if it weren’t for my excellent memory, I wouldn’t have remembered it until now.

“We must determine whether the act of obstructing the view due to building construction exceeds the socially acceptable limit. Before that, we need to assess if the case meets the legal protection requirements for the right to view under Article 35 of the Constitution.”

As I spoke, Shin Jaehee’s eyes widened. She was surprised that someone who had been silent until now suddenly provided the correct answer.

* * *

Had a ghost that drowned in alcohol in a past life possessed her?

Huh.

I was taken aback, watching a woman downing glasses of soju mixed with beer almost in a one-to-one ratio.

I had assumed the student council president of the law department was an ordinary bookworm, but she was a real drinker.

The faces of the new students were also flushed with alcohol. They had just turned of age, after all. Downing drinks like this probably made them feel like adults.

Tsk.

I, too, downed a glass of soju, just like them. The burning sensation down my throat brought back memories of my past life.

‘Back then, I thought I’d die from all the drinking.’

The discipline in the law department seemed strict, but it was nothing compared to the theater and film department I had enrolled in during my previous life.

During the after-party of the orientation, the seniors brewed all sorts of alcoholic concoctions.

The one that still stood out was the kimchi cocktail, made with kimchi stew and soju in a one-to-one ratio.

It was called a cocktail, but I still couldn’t forget the fiery sensation as it went down my throat. The next day, I had to run to the bathroom multiple times.

But this was nothing compared to that. The atmosphere at this after-party was free-spirited. There were no seniors forcing drinks on those who couldn’t handle it...

“Hey, freshman. Won’t you take a drink from me?”

They say words become seeds.

“Why, can’t celebrities drink alcohol given by ordinary people?”

His cheek twitched, and his nostrils flared like a large hallabong. It was more of a provocation than anything else, and it didn’t even make me laugh.

It seemed my words in the lecture hall still bothered him.

“Yes, please give me a drink.”

“Kid, where do you see a freshman taking a senior’s drink in a soju glass? Is the beer glass next to you just for show?”

Nonsense.

As I picked up the beer glass, he poured the soju. He poured so much that he emptied the remaining half-bottle of soju into the glass. It was almost as if he was challenging me to drink it if I could.

Without a word, I picked up the beer glass and downed it, placing it on the table with a sound.

“Senior, won’t you take a drink from me too?”

“Huh?”

It seemed he hadn’t expected me to down the whole glass in one go. His face was visibly shocked. But he had some pride as a senior, so he quickly picked up the beer glass.

You picked the wrong guy.

I poured the same amount of soju as I had received. The senior’s nostrils flared again. But seeing me offering the drink with a smile, he couldn’t refuse. He picked up the glass and downed it.

He hesitated for a moment, but he forced the drink down, not wanting to be humiliated in front of the new students.

“Ah, this is the taste.”

Anyone would think he had lived a long life.

“Here, take another one.”

His nostrils flared again, challenging me to drink more.

Now the new students and even the seniors around us were watching our drinking contest with keen interest.

Kid, I’ve spilled more alcohol than you’ve ever drunk.

“Thank you.”

I downed another glass of soju-filled beer, making his eyes widen.

Eventually.

“Now it’s your turn, senior.”

How much time had passed? By the time the soju bottles in the pub’s fridge were empty, the senior with the flared nostrils had passed out with his face on the table.

I told you to stop showing off. At that moment.

“Have a drink with me too.”

What now?

“Why, don’t you want to?”

“It’s not that, but you’ve already drunk a lot, president.”

“Okay, it’s good to know your limits. Anyway, don’t hate that guy too much. He just returned from the military, so he’s still adjusting.”

“Do law students also serve in the military?”

“I wouldn’t know since I’m a woman. But if you’re not confident about passing the bar exam immediately, it’s better to get it over with. If you delay it until the end, you might end up being dragged away and become a blockhead. So don’t hate senior Hwang too much. I don’t like him either, but he’s not that bad.”

“I understand.”

So his last name is Hwang. I couldn’t help but think of Hwang Cheolsu, who used to be a pest at Songwon Entertainment in the past.

His greedy cheeks looked somewhat similar too.

At that moment, Jaehee’s voice snapped me out of my thoughts.

“Do you really understand? Wasn’t that loach comment about our department?”

“Would I call someone I just met today a loach? And the professor’s question was about judicial justice. The department is too shallow and narrow to be considered the river of judicial justice.”

“You’re not planning to take the bar exam, are you? I didn’t expect any freshman to answer the last question in front of the college building.”

“Didn’t a freshman get half the answer right?”

“She was a student that Byungcheol, the guy standing next to me earlier, used to tutor. He probably showed her the answers before coming here. But she couldn’t memorize everything. But you answered it correctly. Are you really preparing for the bar exam?”

“No way. I’m not smart enough to take the bar exam. I just got lucky that the precedent I reviewed for the oral interview happened to come up.”

“Then why did you apply to the law department?”

“I wanted to see the world more broadly. As an actor, if I just look at scripts, I wouldn’t know how the world outside the script works. And who knows, I might have to play the role of a legal professional in a drama someday.”

“Really?”

But why does this senior’s gaze look like that?

I had seen her downing soju and beer earlier, so maybe that’s why. The corners of the student council president, Jaehee’s eyes were strangely curled.

I was suddenly worried that she might start acting out due to alcohol.

“President.”

“What?”

And should I tell her this?
