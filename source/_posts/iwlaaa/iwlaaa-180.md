Jang Youngguk Syndrome.

The term "syndrome" was historically used in psychopathology but has recently become a positive term referring to social phenomena.

It's not common for an actor to cause a syndrome-like phenomenon. This was something typically seen with stars who led pop culture, such as Michael Jackson, The Beatles, or Queen.

"Mr. Kim Jaecheol, how do you view the current situation?"

A heated debate was ongoing in the studio. Ironically, amidst the discussions on political or ideological topics, the hot topic was an actor named Jang Youngguk.

"I think it's mysterious, enigmatic, and almost miraculous."

"Are you referring to the syndrome phenomenon surrounding actor Jang Youngguk?"

"No, the syndrome is a given. Especially with the massive success of the movie 'Autumn Wind' in Hong Kong and its numerous invitations to international film festivals, it's only natural. What I'm referring to specifically is the actor Jang Youngguk himself."

"Can you elaborate?"

The critic, who was asked the question by the host, stroked his chin and answered.

"As a pop culture critic, I've had the opportunity to encounter numerous actors and singers. Among them were not only new actors but also veterans who had been through thick and thin in the industry. While the charm of new actors is their freshness and boldness, veterans usually represent their careers with their experience and composure. However, actor Jang Youngguk didn't fit into either of these categories. Although he was a new actor, his experience surpassed that of many veterans, showing charisma that went beyond mere boldness. I realized this while observing his acting on the set of 'Confession of a Priest.' I thought, 'This is the person who will lead the Korean film industry in the future.'"

Kim Jaecheol was a critic known for his considerable authority among pop culture critics. He was infamous for his sharp critiques and even harsher reviews. It was said humorously that when Kim Jaecheol attended a film preview, the investment company's staff would get nervous.

Given such praise from him, the sentiment was naturally special.

"As Mr. Kim Jaecheol mentioned, actor Jang Youngguk is often evaluated as showing a level of acting that is on a different level from his peers. His existing filmography is impressive, and his future projects are highly anticipated. Just as we are, the public's interest is soaring day by day. Now, let me ask you one more question."

"Yes."

"Actor Jang Youngguk is gaining immense popularity to the extent of causing a syndrome phenomenon due to the movie 'Autumn Wind,' which premiered in Hong Kong, and the drama 'Prince of the Sea,' which is currently airing in Korea. Amidst this, a scandal has arisen, involving the female lead of the drama. The agencies have denied the rumors, but the public's suspicions persist. What are your thoughts on Jang Youngguk's scandal?"

Kim Jaecheol frowned as if he had heard something nonsensical.

"What does that have to do with anything?"

"Excuse me?"

"I mean, whether the scandal is true or not, what does it matter? The media is the problem. Why do they have to latch onto every little thing? And the public needs to change their perspective! Isn't it enough for an actor to act well? Why can't they date if they want to? They're young men and women, after all! And."

The host was visibly flustered by the sudden outburst and tried to change the subject quickly.

"I would actually be relieved if the scandal were true!"

But at that moment, the critic looked into the live broadcast camera and declared.

"Isn't it a matter that could support the rumors about actor Jang Youngguk's sexual orientation that have been raised so far?"

* * *

"Isn't it a matter that could support the rumors about actor Jang Youngguk's sexual orientation?"

Lee Bongchun, who was holding the steering wheel, was startled and turned down the radio volume. The highlight from last night's discussion program was being replayed on the radio.

Lee Bongchun nervously glanced at the rearview mirror.

"Hyung, it's okay. Turn up the volume."

"Youngguk, are you alright?"

"What, about my sexual orientation becoming clearer?"

"No, I mean, you have to go straight to the filming site as soon as we return. How are you feeling?"

"I'm fine. This is nothing. And considering how filming was delayed because of me, I can't rest any more. I have to give it my all."

Youngguk answered cheerfully and looked down at the script. Although he had a smile on his face, he couldn't hide his bitterness. Even though the agency had released an article saying the scandal was untrue, the media wouldn't believe it.

Despite both parties denying it, additional articles were being produced as if they were already a couple.

This meant that Youngguk himself was a very appealing scoop for reporters.

"Youngguk!"

As soon as they arrived at the filming site, PD Kim Woo-hyung greeted Youngguk with a bright voice. The other staff members were the same.

They welcomed him with even more enthusiasm than usual. It seemed as though they were trying to prevent the atmosphere from becoming chaotic due to the scandal.

"I heard you just returned from Hong Kong. Why don't you take a day off? We can move on to the next scene first."

"The filming has already been delayed because of me. It's fine. In fact, my body is itching to get back to work."

"Didn't you have fun in Hong Kong?"

"Not really. Meeting people is not my thing. Filming is much more fun."

In fact, it wasn't fun but rather bewildering. After all, every person he met was a big shot he had never encountered in his previous life.

"Given your personality, you must have read today's script to the point of wearing it out. During the main scenes, make sure to match your movements well to avoid any reflections on the other actor's face. Especially when stepping, you need to be in sync..."

PD Kim Woo-hyung trailed off.

"Were you about to ask if I practiced with Yeonsu?"

"Uh, yeah."

"We've been practicing constantly even before I left for Hong Kong. The instructor even came down to Busan to help us. But where is Yeonsu?"

"She's in the waiting room."

"The waiting room?"

Usually, Yeonsu would have run out to greet Youngguk as soon as he arrived.

"There have been a lot of paparazzi lately. The FD staff are blocking them from entering the filming site, but those people come with huge cameras and take pictures from afar, so Yeonsu seems to be avoiding the set before filming starts."

The paparazzi were still rampant. For all they knew, someone could be capturing the scene of Youngguk and PD Kim Woo-hyung talking with a massive camera right now.

How much time had passed?

"Cut!"

They were in the middle of the main shoot. The scene involved the protagonists Han Myojeong (Yeonsu) and Lee Soo (Youngguk) holding hands and dancing together.

Despite having practiced with an instructor before leaving for Hong Kong, Yeonsu's steps kept getting tangled whenever the shoot started.

They had already had more than ten takes.

Eventually,

"Let's take a short break."

PD Kim Woo-hyung paused the filming.

* * *

"Are you alright?"

The filming site overlooked the sea. Yeonsu was staring at the flowing waves.

Youngguk handed her a canned drink and plopped down beside her.

"Drink some, it looked like your throat was getting dry earlier."

After making so many mistakes, she had apologized countless times.

Especially Yeonsu, who had been bowing her head and apologizing to the staff like a criminal.

"What's wrong today? We've practiced this many times."

"My body forgot..."

"What?"

"It's been over two weeks since we practiced together, and the only time we matched steps was when the instructor came to Busan for two days. How could I remember?"

Youngguk scratched his head. Due to his exceptional memory, he hadn't forgotten, but for an ordinary person, it would have been easy to forget.

He naturally assumed that Yeonsu would remember their practice sessions.

"You didn't even come to practice before the shoot."

"I thought you were stressed because of the paparazzi... It's all my fault, I'm sorry."

Youngguk acknowledged his mistake. By all accounts, this was entirely his fault.

"..."

"Let's ask the director for some time to practice again. Otherwise, we'll be stuck shooting this scene all day."

"Aren't you bothered?"

"By what?"

"Look over there, they're pointing cameras at us from that observation deck. They're probably taking pictures of us right now."

"Oh, come on, they're probably tourists."

"Have you ever seen a tourist carrying such a big camera? Get up quickly!"

Now that he thought about it, it made sense. If they were trying to photograph seagulls or other birds, they wouldn't be pointing their cameras at them.

Yeonsu hurriedly tried to get up. Her actions pained Youngguk even more.

"It's alright."

Youngguk grabbed Yeonsu's hand as she tried to stand.

Her face turned red at the sudden contact, and she looked visibly uncomfortable. She knew that if the paparazzi captured this moment, it would undoubtedly end up plastered all over the media.

"If we're going to be photographed, we might as well look good."

"What?"

Yeonsu looked blankly at Youngguk.

She watched in surprise as he stood up, holding both of her hands.

Then he moved closer, closing the distance between them.

The paparazzi, who were secretly watching from the observation deck, must have widened their eyes at the sight.

Even a simple conversation scene would have been noteworthy, but now they were standing and almost embracing. However, Youngguk didn't seem to care about the paparazzi.

"We need to rehearse anyway. If we mess up during the shoot, saying sorry won't cut it. If the photos make headlines, we can say it was just a rehearsal. After all, the broadcast will show us dancing."

Yeonsu nodded slightly. Encouraged by this, Youngguk continued.

"I hope you won't worry too much about the dating rumors. It might be awkward to say this to an actress, but if this scandal affects your future..."

"If it does?"

Youngguk held both of Yeonsu's hands and danced as they did during the shoot.

Unlike during the filming, her steps didn't falter once. Seeing this, Youngguk smiled and said,

"In that case, I'll take responsibility for you."
