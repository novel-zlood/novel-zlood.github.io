End-of-show party.

The rise and fall of a drama are determined by none other than its viewership ratings.

In that sense, many dramas with poor ratings often end early, sometimes concluding without even a proper wrap-up party, let alone an end-of-show party.

Conversely, if the ratings are on an upward trend, discussions about extending the broadcast are natural, and the end-of-show party is grand, just like now.

Swoosh―!

A crowd of journalists, reminiscent of a red carpet event, is gathered.

As the actors from the historical drama 'Yeonsan, The King's Secret' arrive one by one, dazzling spotlights flash, almost blindingly. Occasionally, some journalists make mischievous requests to the actors.

"Choi Hyejin! Could you strike a cool pose as Jang Noksu?"

'What?'

Actress Choi Hyejin looked slightly embarrassed at the journalist's shout.

To pose as Jang Noksu. She wondered if she should dance with a drum slung over her shoulder.

“Noksu, why are you hesitating?”

Someone rested a hand on Choi Hyejin's shoulder and made an appearance. As she turned her head in surprise, there stood none other than Youngguk.

Kyaaa―!

Citizens who were watching the end-of-show party cheered in unison, and journalists hurriedly pressed their camera shutters.

Youngguk, almost like an escort, carefully led Choi Hyejin by the hand and walked towards the convention hall where the end-of-show party was being held.

The scene, reminiscent of Yeonsangun and Jang Noksu from the drama, made the onlookers' hearts flutter.

"Noona, I'm sorry. You seemed a bit uncomfortable."

"Oh, no. It's okay."

As soon as the journalists' attention shifted, Youngguk released the hand he was holding. Watching Youngguk's retreating figure, Choi Hyejin unconsciously brushed her dry lips.

'What's with this young one's charisma.'

To say she wasn't disappointed would be a lie. But she soon shook her head. Isn't she a top actress? Soon, the flustered look on Choi Hyejin's face turned cold and aloof again.

"PD Yoo, why is the end-of-show party so grand?"

Youngguk exclaimed in amazement. The convention hall where the party was being held was lavishly decorated, with all sorts of delicacies and a dazzling chandelier illuminating the attendees.

To an outsider, it might have seemed like a scene from an awards ceremony rather than an end-of-show party.

"Isn't it more extravagant than 'The Man of August'?"

"That's an understatement. I thought that was grand, but this is something else."

"The broadcast station is in a complete festive mood right now. We were up against KBC with a historical drama in the same time slot, and we won. The usually reserved president even gave special orders for the Yeonsan team's end-of-show party to be the best ever."

"How's KBC doing?"

"Needless to say, they're probably in mourning."

It was a much-anticipated showdown between KBC and MBS in the media. Most people had predicted KBC's victory. After all, KBC was known for its strong traditional historical dramas.

But MBS turned the tables and knocked out KBC. The highest minute-by-minute rating before the final episode surpassed 43%, so there's no need to say more.

"Youngguk, the director will be here soon, so I'll go greet him. And don't let Director Kim drink too much. He never listens to me. I'm worried he'll be completely drunk before the director arrives. Sigh."

"Got it."

Youngguk smiled lightly and nodded briefly.

As the famous PD had mentioned, Director Kim Deukhyeong was already in high spirits, repeatedly raising his champagne glass. If he drank a bit more, he might start dancing or even singing trot.

As Youngguk moved towards Director Kim Deukhyeong.

"Jang Youngguk?"

* * *

'Who is that?'

A man with a weasel-like mustache. His thin eyes and chubby cheeks gave him a greedy appearance. He was neither a staff member nor an actor in the drama crew.

However, his face seemed vaguely familiar. While Youngguk was deep in thought.

"Ah, I am this person."

The man pulled out a business card from his thick wallet. Even the card, with its gold trim, was extravagant.

Youngguk, after receiving the card, finally spoke.

"BS Entertainment?"

"Yes, that's correct. I am Yang Sugab, the representative of BS Entertainment."

'Oh, this guy?'

He was a fairly well-known figure in the entertainment industry in his past life. There are various types of agency representatives.

Some are scammers, some are businessmen, and some are artists.

If Kim Sunghwan, the representative of Songwon Entertainment, leaned towards being an artist, this guy was a typical scammer. And a very bad one at that.

"Our actress Choi Hyejin speaks so highly of you, Youngguk. As you know, BS Entertainment spares no expense in investing in our actors."

'Choi Hyejin is with them?'

BS Entertainment was infamous for constant scandals. From entertainment services to embezzlement by the agency's representative. Although not revealed yet, these would later be sensationalized in the media.

"As a representative, it's rare for me to personally meet actors, but I made an exception for you, Youngguk. It’s known that you have an exclusive contract with Songwon Entertainment, but to be blunt, don't you think it's a waste for a talented actor like you to be with a small agency like Songwon?"

'What nonsense.'

Youngguk replied without revealing his true feelings.

"I'm not interested."

"Of course, what?"

"I'm busy, so I'll be going."

As he returned the business card, Yang Sugab's face hardened.

As Youngguk walked away towards the filming staff, as if nothing had happened, Yang Sugab's cheeks twitched violently.

"Huh, does he think I'm a peddler?"

Yang Sugab had built a considerable reputation in the broadcasting world. Through numerous entertainments and lobbying, he had established various connections.

As the representative of BS Entertainment, he had immense pride.

But he had never been so blatantly disrespected before. The returned business card was crumpled harshly in his hand.

* * *

"What do you want me to do?"

Choi Hyejin looked incredulous. Standing opposite her was Yang Sugab, the agency representative.

It was the peak of the end-of-show party. The two were facing each other in a secluded hallway of the convention hall.

"Hyejin, do you think the world is yours just because people are calling you the top beauty actress in Korea?"

"······."

"Did I ask for something difficult? Just roll around once. Just get a picture with Jang Youngguk. You've done it before. Do you want to act all pure now?"

Choi Hyejin glared at Yang Sugab, narrowing her eyes. But Yang Sugab shrugged indifferently.

"Should I reveal that you worked at Nain before? You know how quickly rumors spread in this industry if I tell a few reporter friends."

"As an agency representative, how can you do this to your actress?"

"For me, it's just losing one actress. But what can I do? If a dog I've been raising doesn't listen, I have to eat it. What about you? You'll have to pay penalties for the advertisement contracts and the agency's exclusive contract. You won't be able to set foot in Yeouido, let alone the entertainment industry. Hyejin, I don't want to make this dirty. Let's make it easy."

Choi Hyejin collapsed to the floor, wiping away tears. Yang Sugab, shaking his head as if disgusted, walked away.

The end-of-show party was already filled with many drunk attendees. When the drama director personally handed out the president's special cash gifts, the excitement peaked. Youngguk, too, had lost count of how many glasses of champagne he had.

"Come here, lucky charm! It's been a while since we sang together!"

"Director, why are you singing trot after drinking champagne!"

"Youngmin, you go away. Youngguk and I have a bond you don't understand. Youngguk! Oh, my lucky charm!"

Director Kim Deukhyeong's nose was as red as a ripe strawberry. Drunk, he hugged Youngguk and danced, making the staff burst into laughter.

Writer Choi Eun-sook approached the famous PD and subtly poked his waist.

"PD Yoo, how do you feel?"

"About what?"

"About surpassing a 40% viewership rating for the first time."

"It's all thanks to you, Writer Choi. And with such great actors and staff, all I did was present the feast prepared for the viewers."

"Are you being humble or modest? By the way, where's our Jang Noksu? Where did Actress Choi go?"

"She went out to talk to her agency representative."

"Oh, that man with the long mustache? He's the representative of BS Entertainment, right? I've heard bad things about him. I wonder why Actress Choi is with them."

As the famous PD and Writer Choi Eun-sook were chatting, Choi Hyejin returned to the party, having fixed her expression and makeup. It was impossible to tell she had been crying.

"Youngguk, can we talk for a moment?"

Choi Hyejin approached Youngguk, who was mingling with the staff. The staff exchanged knowing glances and stepped aside. AD Kim Youngmin even gave Youngguk a push and a "fighting" cheer.

'Oh, boy.'

"What's up, noona?"

Youngguk smiled at her.

"I'm too drunk..."

Choi Hyejin, pretending to be drunk, leaned her head on Youngguk's shoulder. To an outsider, they might look like a couple.

But Youngguk was puzzled.

Throughout the filming, Choi Hyejin had kept her distance. But now, seeing her troubled expression, he realized.

'Of course.'

The entertainment industry is as dark as it is glamorous. Unimaginable things happen behind the scenes.

After all, it was the gangsters who initially started the entertainment agencies as a business.

Yang Sugab of BS Entertainment was just as bad as those types.

Youngguk straightened her up by the shoulder and said,

"Noona."

Choi Hyejin's eyes trembled violently at his next words.

"Did the representative tell you to?"
