Viewer ratings.

In the broadcasting industry, it is often said that the success or failure of a show is determined by its first episode. Thus, whether it’s a drama or a variety show, the first episode is crucial, especially for historical dramas.

Due to the historical background of the script, product placement (PPL) is impossible, and the high production costs required for set installations make viewer ratings significant. In that sense, it was no exaggeration to say that MBS’s historical drama “Yeonsan, The King’s Secret” was a hit from its first broadcast.

“Kim PD, did you hear? The Yeonsan drama exceeded double-digit ratings from the first episode?”

“Of course I heard. Who wouldn’t know? It hit 27% during these times. The drama department is buzzing.”

“What’s the buzz about? Isn’t it a cause for celebration?”

“Well, it’s complicated. The drama that ended prematurely before this launch was Park PD’s, right? He tried to gather production costs to get promoted to CP, but it failed miserably. Now, the new drama that followed is a hit from the first episode. And initially, no one wanted to take on the historical drama, but it hit big from the start, making other PDs envious.”

The historical drama “Yeonsan, The King’s Secret” became a hot topic among MBS broadcasting station’s variety and news departments from the first episode.

After all, it was a drama everyone predicted would fail. It was expected to be crushed by KBC, known for its historical drama expertise, but it dominated the same time slot from the first episode.

“Hey, the drama is coming. Let’s go.”

The variety show PDs, who were chatting on the rooftop of the MBS building, put out their cigarettes and hurried downstairs when they saw the drama PDs.

“Senior Choi, are you going to the dinner today? The director said he’s hosting it.”

“What dinner all of a sudden?”

“You know, for Yoo PD’s drama. I heard even the head director is coming.”

“Hey, you tactless guy, do you have to mention that here? You know Senior Park is having a hard time. Don’t mention it when he comes up. And don’t bring it up to the head director. He always praised Senior Park.”

MBS drama department PD Kim Youngchul pouted his lips.

The broadcasting industry is a jungle. Just like in any other company, networking is key to survival.

In that sense, these two were riding the head director’s line.

Just then, Park PD came up to the rooftop.

“What are you two talking about? And everyone’s attending the dinner today, right? The head director is coming, so try to reschedule and attend.”

“Senior Park, are you really going?”

“Why wouldn’t I? The stingy director is treating us to beef; of course, I’m going.”

“Geez, Senior Park, you’re too good-hearted. Honestly, even if the first episode was a hit, the other side is like a funeral. It doesn’t make sense to throw a party. It’s like the head director only cares about Yoo PD. And he always said Senior Park should be promoted to CP, but now he’s silent after the early termination.”

“Don’t be so harsh. Given the current atmosphere, the head director can’t just back out. And you know he’s not someone who takes back his words. Don’t worry. This won’t last long.”

Park PD put a cigarette in his mouth and continued.

“There’s a saying, ‘The first success is often the last.’ Our drama department pushed it a lot, so it had to get those ratings. And it’s all because of Jang Youngguk and Cha Hyejin. You know, like how a new restaurant gets a lot of attention only at the beginning. This won’t last long.”

PD Kim Youngchul, listening to the senior PDs’ conversation, still couldn’t shake his doubts. Is the first success really just a fluke?

* * *

The atmosphere on the filming set felt like a spring day with cherry blossoms in full bloom. The first broadcast rating was 27%, so it was natural.

Moreover, the buzz from Youngguk’s dual role in the first episode was already making headlines.

The contrast between the crown prince and the commoner was so stark that it felt like two completely different actors were cast.

“Youngguk, when we shoot scene 31 today, remember not to drink too much at once. You know we’ll have to redo the scene if you choke.”

“Got it. By the way, Yoo PD, you seem in a good mood today.”

“Of course. I prayed for double digits in the first broadcast, and we hit 27%. We had a small dinner with the drama department. The director even gave us a cash bonus for the filming team.”

“We should invite Writer Choi too, right?”

Yoo Myung-han nodded briefly and added with a meaningful expression.

“By the way, Youngguk, if there are rewards, you’re coming with us, right?”

“Isn’t it too early to be thinking about that?”

“What’s wrong with dreaming? I’ve already talked to the head director, so we’ll probably go abroad. I heard you didn’t get to go to Phuket with SBC.”

“I couldn’t go because of work. But it’s only the first episode, and you’re already thinking about a reward trip. That’s not like you, Yoo PD.”

“You haven’t seen the edited footage yet. You only monitor after filming, so you’re not sure. I assure you, each episode will be a home run.”

Youngguk laughed. If the ratings continued to soar, Yoo Myung-han’s promise of a reward trip wouldn’t be a lie.

Soon, AD Kim Youngmin’s voice announced that the stand-by was complete.

“Scene number 31, The Reason for the Literati Purge―!”

At the residence of Prince Je-an, King Yeonsan was holding a banquet.

Prince Je-an, known as the Foolish Prince, knew why King Yeonsan was visiting his residence. It was because of Jang Nok-su, his concubine.

“Jang Nok-su, such a beautiful name, like the blue path of the Amnok River. Will you dance for me now?”

“How could I disobey your command, Your Majesty?”

As Jang Nok-su, with a janggu on her shoulder, began to dance, King Yeonsan, Yi Yung, sipped his drink. Ascending to the throne felt like conquering the world.

But there were still many obstacles. Just because he sat on the throne didn’t mean he could control the world; there were too many opposing forces. But he had known this since he was the crown prince.

Just then, the voice of Gyeomsabok Jang Gwak-san was heard.

“Your Majesty, Mulyongun has arrived.”

“Let him in.”

At King Yeonsan’s gesture, Jang Nok-su stopped dancing. Soon, Mulyongun Yoo Jagwang entered. His weasel-like beard indicated his reputation as a notorious sycophant.

The reason King Yeonsan summoned him to Prince Je-an’s residence was simple.

“Mulyongun, it’s been a while. Do you know why I called you here?”

“I heard there’s a royal command. No matter what it is, I will fulfill it even if it costs my life.”

“Though your faults are many and you haven’t held a major government position, I’ve always kept you in mind. The reason I called you here is to do something for me.”

Yoo Jagwang’s eyes shone brightly as he bowed deeply.

“What should I do?”

“Find and investigate the writings of the late Kim Jong-jik. Then report everything to me. I will use it well.”

“Kim Jong-jik...”

He was known as the leader of the Sarim faction. Though he had passed away, his writings and spirit were the core of the Sarim faction’s ideology.

Why did King Yeonsan want Yoo Jagwang to investigate the writings of the late Kim Jong-jik?

As Yoo Jagwang left the hall, Jang Nok-su, with a seductive motion, approached King Yeonsan Yi Yung.

“Your Majesty, he is known as a sycophant. Why did you call him here?”

No one would dare speak so freely to the king, but Jang Nok-su was different. Known as the most beautiful woman in Joseon, she had no reservations in her manner toward Yeonsan.

King Yeonsan found her intriguing and gave her a glance, then raised his drink again.

Despite Jang Nok-su’s seductive gaze, King Yeonsan’s eyes were focused on a distant place.

The ripples in his drink were like the impending bloodshed.

King Yeonsan put down his drink with a clink and spoke.

“It’s to wield a sword in the court.”

“Mom, I have something to watch.”

“No, you can’t right now. It’s almost time for Yeonsan, The King’s Secret.”

Shin Jae-hee pouted. She didn’t usually watch TV often, but today she didn’t want to give in. It was the day SBC was airing a documentary on international lawyers, which she was interested in. But her mother wouldn’t budge.

“Why is it so interesting?”

“Just watch it once. Youngguk looks so cool.”

“Whatever.”

Even if he looked cool on screen, in school, he was just another student.

He could be quite annoying. Even during the mock trial class, he asked more questions than any other student.

He asked so many questions that even after the class ended, he spent a long time talking with the professor alone.

It was curious where such a person came from.

Eventually, out of curiosity, Shin Jae-hee asked if he had done any pre-study before entering university, and his answer was ridiculous.

“No, I just understood it after I started studying post-admission.”

Even Shin Jae-hee, who prided herself on her studies, couldn’t stand him. One could only imagine how other students felt.

Soon, the historical drama started airing on the screen.

“He acts well.”

Though she didn’t usually watch dramas, Shin Jae-hee couldn’t take her eyes off the screen.

Especially the dual role of the crown prince and the commoner was captivating. If someone didn’t know better, they might think they were two different people.

How much time had passed?

“Wow.”

When the scene ended with a knife to Jang Nok-su’s throat, Shin Jae-hee couldn’t help but exclaim.

Cha Hyejin, known as the most beautiful woman in Korea, suited the role of Jang Nok-su perfectly.

But the audience’s attention was on Jang Youngguk, who played King Yeonsan.

Jang Youngguk’s gestures and deep voice had a way of stirring people’s hearts. Even Jang Nok-su’s pupils were shaking on screen.

The preview for the next episode was enough to captivate the audience further, showing the crown prince doing push-ups alone in his palace.

As the drama and preview ended, Shin Jae-hee unknowingly asked.
