The filming period for historical dramas generally exceeds a year. Therefore, from the perspective of broadcasting stations, historical dramas inevitably become a burden over time.

As mini-series gain more popularity, viewers' tastes are also shifting toward shorter episodes and more intense storylines. In this context, the fusion historical drama "Yeonsan, The King's Secret" has accurately identified viewers' needs.

"Senior Yoo, they said they'll send the B team's tape directly by quick service. And the C team has just departed for the Yongin Folk Village. We followed the director's idea to make the royal robe scene we shot more dynamic and sent it to VFX. But what are you so deeply thinking about?"

The stuffy air of the editing room lingers. No wonder it's often said that the editing room is always filled with a perpetual daylight phenomenon.

Basically, jump cuts need to be attached, and scenes shot in advance need to be edited into a montage. Moreover, numerous tasks such as corrections and smoothly cutting unnecessary footage await, tasks too many to count.

Of course, while the professional technical work is done by the head of the editing team and the editing room staff, it is only natural for the director holding the megaphone to sit beside them.

"Scene 47, originally, I was going to use a swish pan, but no matter how I look at it, it's too good to just sweep away."

"You mean the scene where Youngguk is doing push-ups with his shirt off?"

"Yes, even Team Leader Kim from the editing room said it was too good to capture only in full shot. At that time, we were so distracted by the costume team burning the clothes that we shot exactly as storyboarded, but looking back, it's such a waste. After checking today's edited video, I feel it even more."

The scene of Scene 47 appears on the screen beyond the editing room's equipment. The crown prince doing push-ups in the Eastern Palace is captured in full shot.

Only then could AD Kim Youngmin properly check the footage.

During the shoot, he was too busy discussing cooperation matters with the supporting cast leader to prepare for the next scene and couldn't even see the shooting in the Eastern Palace. Rumor had it that it was so spectacular that the female staff on set had to cover their mouths.

"Wow, Mijeong Unnie was right."

"Mijeong?"

"The head of the costume team. She was so worried about Youngguk's clothes burning. Before the shoot started, she came to me asking how the PD was feeling, and after talking with the supporting cast leader, her face completely changed. She said it was the best costume she'd ever seen in her life? I wondered what she meant... Wow, look at those muscles on his arms and chest."

AD Kim Youngmin's mouth opened wide as he looked at the man's body.

"Kim Youngmin, but how do you call the costume team leader, who is much older than me, 'Unnie'?"

"Oh, we've been drinking together a few times before the crank-in. The costume, art, and makeup team people are probably more comfortable with me than with you, PD. So we just decided to call her 'Unnie.' She might look strict, but she's actually quite soft-hearted. After the shoot, she was almost in tears saying, 'Our youngest survived,' and it broke my heart."

"Huh, you're quite the smooth talker."

"But this scene, if it airs, the ratings will skyrocket. Instead of just the full shot, let's shoot it again from a different angle as a medium shot. Director supported the C team anyway, so this bit of extra schedule should be fine. But seriously, did Youngguk prepare for a physical education test instead of law school? Or are kids these days just growing better? Oh, wasn't there an orientation today?"

"He probably attended by now. And hey, Youngguk is only nine years younger than you. He's an adult. An adult. Though appearance-wise, you look older than me, Youngmin."

"What, I didn't know you thought of me like that, Senior Yoo. Then why don't you just call me 'Hyung'?"

"You little...!"

Despite the bickering, their eyes remain glued to the screen, focusing on the crown prince Lee Young's defined muscles.

They simultaneously exclaim at the following scene. The sweat glistening in the dawn light creates a picture-perfect image.

O.T

The campus already feels lively as if it's springtime due to the orientation for new university students.

Though the ink on their ID cards might not even be dry, they all seem to be trying hard to look mature, likely due to their pride in shedding their underage status. Some have already dyed their hair, and some have curly perms. It's a good time.

"It's a good time."

As the words inadvertently slip out, manager Lee Bongchun glances at the rearview mirror.

"Youngguk, sometimes you seem like an old man. All those students walking around are the same age as you. They all look like new students, walking around excitedly. But you..."

"What about me?"

"You look like a graduating student preparing for employment. There's no excitement on your face. Maybe it's because I didn't go to college, but just being on a college campus excites me. Even when I was selling hagfish at Jagalchi Market, it was the same. My younger sister pestered me, so I once visited Busan National University with her, and the students drinking soju and playing guitars on the lawn looked so romantic."

"Not because of campus couples?"

"What's a campus couple? This car is 2,000 cc, though."

The campus of Korea University is one of the largest in the country. Therefore, it's quite a distance from the front gate to the law school building.

Soon, the law school building comes into view through the car window. It's an old building showing signs of age. Ivy covers the thick walls, adding to the atmosphere.

Moreover, a fluttering banner proudly displays the names of last year's bar exam passers, proving the building's deep history.

The number of names is so many that it fills the entire front of the banner. No wonder, as only the best and brightest gather here.

"I'll be back."

"Okay, Youngguk. Have a good time!"

Manager Lee Bongchun waves his hand vigorously, as if seeing off a younger sibling going on a school trip. So vigorously that the van shakes. Despite his old-man demeanor, Youngguk is still just a newly minted adult.

However, due to his constant filming schedule, he probably hasn't had the chance to enjoy his youth like other students his age. So today, the manager hoped he would forget about the drama and fully enjoy the new student orientation.

"Room 107."

He repeats the room number where the orientation is held. The first-floor hallway is already deserted.

He had arrived precisely at the start time to avoid drawing attention.

Youngguk stops at room 107 and opens the door.

"Starting the orientation for Korea University's law school freshmen..."

But contrary to his thoughts, he draws even more attention. As the back door of the lecture hall opens, all the freshmen and upperclassmen at the podium turn to look at Youngguk. Moreover, their eyes widen as they recognize his face. At that moment,

"Why are you so slow even though you're late! Sit down quickly."

"Excuse me?"

"You're a law school freshman, right? No matter how handsome your classmate is, you shouldn't stare with your mouths open. How sad would the upperclassmen here feel? Now, everyone, focus!"

The bob-haired female student standing at the podium demands attention. Her voice is so assertive that the freshmen, who were surprised by Youngguk's face, quickly turn their heads back.

Soon, it becomes clear who the bob-haired female student is.

"Nice to meet you all. I'm Shin Jaehee, a third-year student and the president of the 51st law school student association at Korea University."

* * *

As with any freshmen, upperclassmen are like gods. In reality, they may be only a few years older, but to the rookies in the university's environment, they seem as tall as mountains.

"Hello, I'm Kim Manseok, a law school freshman!"

One by one, the freshmen go up to the podium to introduce themselves. The upperclassmen, including the student president, sit in the front row with their legs crossed, receiving the greetings.

In contrast, the freshmen on the podium all look nervous.

"Aren't you going to say your class year? And are you not going to do any talent shows? Just saying your name won't stick in our heads anyway. And why is your voice so small? Why are this year's freshmen so unspirited? Should I do an exorcism on the first day of orientation?"

Eventually, awkward dances and songs follow under pressure. The freshmen waiting for their turn look burdened.

The student president, unable to watch any longer, suggests ending the talent show here, but a mischievous upperclassman interrupts.

"Hey, Shin Jaehee. Are you ignoring your seniors just because you're the student president?"

"I'm suggesting we wrap up because the department head will be here soon. And if you want to see a talent show, you should lead by example. Do any of the freshmen here even know your name?"

"What!"

Just then, it's Youngguk's turn. As he steps onto the podium, attention once again focuses on him. After all, he's an actor and this year's top law school entrant.

After bowing and greeting the seniors and classmates, the upperclassman who had been arguing with the student president sneers.

"No special treatment for celebrities. We still expect a talent show."

‘It's like a childish prank.’

Oh, right, it is a childish prank. As Youngguk unintentionally chuckles, the upperclassman in the front row glares at him.

His nose as big as a hallabong and his cheeks full of greed, Youngguk remembers his face. At that moment,

"Are all the freshmen here?"

An elderly professor with white hair enters the lecture hall. He was one of the interviewers at the oral interview.

As soon as he enters, he sees Youngguk on the podium and smiles warmly.

After bowing to the professor, Youngguk returns to his seat, and the upperclassman, narrowing his eyes, gestures as if to say he's lucky.

The elderly professor at the podium begins to speak to the freshmen and upperclassmen.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Shin Jeonggil, the head of the law department at Korea University. You might think it's odd for an old man to be here on such a joyous day, but please understand. I couldn't wait to meet the students who will lead the Korea University law department."

Everyone focuses as the professor starts speaking.

"Students who applied through the regular admission process would have met me at the oral interview. As an interviewer, I wanted to understand the values of the incoming students. Although there were multiple interview questions, most answers regarding judicial justice were similar. Except for one student."

At that moment, the professor's gaze turns to one person.

"The phrase 'There is no solution due to the lack of self-reflection' has lingered in my mind. Jang Youngguk, do you still believe that?"

Instantly, all eyes in the lecture hall follow the professor's gaze to Youngguk. Even student president Shin Jaehee looks at him with surprise.

Despite the sudden attention, Youngguk calmly answers.

"Today confirmed it for me."

"What did?"

"That one bad apple spoils the whole barrel."

"Then we just need to remove that bad apple, don't we?"

"That's not what I'm concerned about."

"Then what is?"

Youngguk glances around the room. He then brushes past the upperclassman's face who had been bickering with the student president as if ignoring him.

The next answer makes the professor's eyes gleam.
