Inferiority complex (열등감).

"Youngguk, are you acquainted with actress Son Hwa-won?" 

I looked up at the question from CEO Kim Seong-hwan. It was after we had a conversation regarding an advertisement contract.

It seems like the agency contacted us just a few days after meeting Song Jeong-seok, striking while the iron is hot.

"Son Hwa-won contacted the agency saying she wants to meet you, Youngguk. She said she already talked with you."

"I heard it from Jeong-seok hyung when I met him before. Son Hwa-won wanted to meet me, so I agreed. I didn't know she would contact the agency again."

"The actor Song Jeong-seok from the indie film you did together? No wonder. Our manager Kim was surprised when Son Hwa-won suddenly contacted us. But it's a sign of respect. She contacted the agency again to make sure you weren't pressured by Jeong-seok hyung."

He's always been a straightforward person.

Indeed, even when an unknown supporting actor sought advice from the lead actor, he didn't hesitate to give acting tips.

- Don't be too anxious about being a supporting actor. Opportunities will come eventually. From what I've seen of you, Youngguk, you won't miss those opportunities. Don’t give up on acting. One day, you will surely stand where I am now.

He was the only friend and fellow actor who made me feel an inferiority complex.

But perhaps because of poor social skills, I distanced myself from him.

"By the way, isn't this Son Hwa-won an emerging star in Chungmuro? It seems like the actors I have my eye on always show interest in you, Youngguk."

"Was there another actor like that?"

"Do you know how many agencies are waiting for your exclusive contract period to end? Son Hwa-won might be one of them, subtly probing you after a hint from her agency."

"She's not like that. But which actor wanted to meet me? Now I'm curious."

"That's a business secret."

CEO Kim Seong-hwan made a playful gesture of zipping his mouth, causing Youngguk to suppress his laughter.

"That's great. Just tell her to come to the filming set. I'll be in Yongin for a while anyway."

* * *

Most of Chungmuro's emerging stars have something special.

A vivid sense of realism, humor and quick wit better than most comedians, and acting skills that evoke awe from the audience.

Among them, actress Son Hwa-won's specialty lies in her innocence.

"Thank you for your hard work today."

Though it might sound strange for a man to say "innocence," just look at how she bows and greets each and every staff member.

With her fair and delicate appearance and a naive smile like that of a country dog on her lips.

No wonder female fans call it a "pure love smile."

"Hwa-won, great job on the CF shoot today. And tomorrow, you'll need to visit the broadcasting station for a meeting about the next project. You'll stop by the shop, right?"

"No, there's no need to visit the shop just to meet the PD and writer. It's more genuine and better to go in my usual attire."

"You say that because you have a good base. Some picky actors can't leave the house without full makeup."

"By the way, hyung, have you contacted Songwon Entertainment?"

Son Hwa-won's eyes were filled with curiosity.

"I was about to tell you. Actor Jang is too busy to meet separately, but they said you could visit the set if you're free. I was going to tell you later because I thought you might be tired, but you can probably see him if you go to Yongin now."

"Really, the set?"

"Yes. But are you really going to ask actor Jang for advice? It seems pointless to me, but since you want it so much. Honestly, actor Jang just got lucky with a good project, and now that your face is known in Chungmuro, you can spread your wings once you move into dramas. As your manager, I don't think you have anything to envy compared to Jang Youngguk."

Son Hwa-won smiled at her manager's words, knowing he said it for her sake.

Objectively and subjectively, she knew she was far behind actor Jang Youngguk.

Though she was gaining popularity as Chungmuro's emerging star, it was an undeserved title.

Who could have known that her fair and delicate appearance, popular during her child actor days, would hold her back so much?

Her gentlemanly, delicate looks constantly led to similar roles and performances.

She feared her image would become fixed.

Crunch.

Her fist tightened unconsciously. While Son Hwa-won struggled with stereotypes, what caught her eye was none other than actor Jang Youngguk.

They were both in their early 20s and had been acting since childhood, but Jang Youngguk was on a completely different path.

'How can he act like that?'

His acting was so powerful that his charisma was palpable even through the screen. Every project in his filmography was unique.

From the nation's first love to a fiercely intense priest and a brief performance as the top playboy of Joseon in a theater festival.

It was unbelievable. How could someone in their early 20s continue to make such drastic transformations?

"Hwa-won, always remember what I say. The entertainment industry is a marathon, not a sprint. It doesn't matter who gets ahead first. I believe you'll soon become a big star. Since the title of 'nation's first love' is taken, how about 'nation's pure love boy'?"

In the car heading to the historical drama set in Yongin, the manager said.

But Son Hwa-won couldn't think of anything but one person as she gazed out the window.

* * *

According to unofficial history (야사), it is said that King Yeonsangun, the 10th king of Joseon, sometimes had civilian doctors instead of royal physicians examine him under the watchful eyes of the Queen Dowager.

According to the famous doctor Yoo Ik-jun of Hanyang who diagnosed him, Yeonsangun's body suffered from severe tuberculosis since his youth, and he wouldn't live past 30.

But no one knows whether his statement was true or not.

- Gyeol, you must gradually show yourself ascending to the throne in my stead. As your older brother, I wish to take care of you and officially register with the court, but it's regrettable that I cannot. During the week receiving treatment from a doctor in secret, wear the royal robe and stand in for me.

Baekjeong Yi Gyeol, attending the royal lecture (경연), was sweating profusely.

The unfamiliar royal robe seemed to weigh heavily on his shoulders, and the gazes of the officials were enough to suffocate him.

Of course, the only one who noticed his abnormality was the bodyguard Gwak San standing by his side.

"Your Majesty, as a king and the father of the people, you must not cancel the royal lecture to examine the lives of the people. According to Chapter 20 of the Doctrine of the Mean, there are nine virtues to rule the world and make the nation prosperous. One of them is to inspect and respect the ministers and listen to their intentions. How can you seek to cancel the royal lecture?"

The officials raised their voices in unison.

Naturally, it was because the king had suddenly announced the suspension of the three daily royal lectures for a week.

"Since the founding of the dynasty, there has never been a case where the royal lecture was suspended. The former king hosted the most royal lectures since King Sejong. Yet, to suddenly cancel the lectures is not the right course of action. Your Majesty, please reconsider!"

"Please reconsider, Your Majesty!"

"Please reconsider, Your Majesty!"

The voices of the officials sitting on either side echoed through the hall. Yi Gyeol's mind was so cluttered that it felt like it would burst.

Though he had learned palace etiquette with the help of bodyguard Gwak San, the Four Books and Five Classics, including the Doctrine of the Mean, the Great Learning, and the Book of Changes, were entirely different matters.

Having never studied them, how could he know?

When bodyguard Gwak San was about to speak, Yi Gyeol stood up, his royal robe fluttering.

"Do the ministers truly mean that the royal lecture is for the people?"

"Your Majesty, how could we utter falsehoods? By following the teachings of the sages, we aim to govern the country wisely..."

"Enough!"

Yi Gyeol's voice silenced the official from the Office of Special Advisors.

"The main content of the royal lecture I observed over the past two days was not about examining the lives of the people. It was about trying to teach me to represent the factions each of you belong to. To understand the people's starvation and reality, shouldn't we know how the country operates and what happens in the marketplace rather than just sitting here and listening to the teachings of the ancient sages?"

"Your Majesty, such matters are addressed through memorials from all over the country."

"A single sentence can deceive many people. How can I trust what I haven't seen? Bring me the memorials from Gamcheong-ri."

The memorials were handed to Yi Gyeol. He read them aloud.

"This is a memorial from the official Najutaek of Gamcheong-ri. It states that due to flood damage, the crops have failed, and he has opened the granaries to distribute food to the starving people. Thus, he asks if the tax rate for Gamcheong-ri could be lowered this year. If we only look at this memorial, Najutaek seems like an official deserving a great reward for lowering the tax rate and distributing food. But!"

Yi Gyeol's sharp gaze swept over the officials.

As a butcher from Gyeolsan Valley, hadn't he frequently visited Gamcheong-ri nearby?

Najutaek was a corrupt official who exploited the people's labor.

He did collect taxes despite the crop failure due to the flood, and he didn't open the granaries.

"This memorial cleverly mixes truth and lies. The crop failure is true, but he collected taxes from the people and didn't open the granaries. Moreover, he submitted a false memorial asking for a lower tax rate. How many more false memorials like this are there from all over Joseon!"

Yi Gyeol shouted at the officials.

"This is the king's order. Instead of holding royal lectures for a week, investigate the corruption of officials and the lives of the people without any falsehoods. This is the task I assign to you!"

Son Hwa-won stood idly in front of the vending machine located on one side of the set. She couldn't bear to watch the filming any longer.

The more she watched, the more an unknown emotion surged within her.

Though they were of similar age, Jang Youngguk's acting was captivating.

She moved away, clenching her trembling fist, unable to overcome the inferiority complex otherwise.

"Here you are."

How much time had passed? Youngguk, having finished his scene, found Son Hwa-won. She bowed her head involuntarily at his sudden appearance.

"Hello, I'm actress Son Hwa-won. I'm sorry for showing up at the set so abruptly. I just really wanted to meet you, Jang Youngguk."

"No, it's fine. I already heard from Jeong-seok hyung. And you're three years older than me, so please speak comfortably. By the way, isn't it funny? Just ten meters away, you can see the grand eaves of the palace, yet there's a vending machine right here."

He had come straight to see her after changing his costume.

Son Hwa-won had a mountain of questions for Youngguk, but she couldn't bring herself to ask.

After all, she felt such an inferiority complex watching his performance. Sensing this, Youngguk started the conversation.

"I heard you wanted to ask me something, likely about acting?"

"Yes. I can't shake the thought that my acting is too confined. Even after talking to other senior actors in my agency, I couldn't resolve it. Then I happened to watch your movies. I was speechless, wondering how someone my age could transform into a completely different person with each role."

‘Honest.’

Youngguk thought as he looked at Son Hwa-won. She was as genuine as she had been when advising him in his past life.

Most actors would be reluctant to reveal their vulnerabilities, yet here she was, laying her heart bare.

Moreover, Youngguk understood the problem she was struggling with.

‘It's probably the image issue that Hwa-won hyung is worried about.’

Though a male actor, he was ironically famous for his innocence. This had likely limited his roles.

Most of them were similar in nature.

Though it was a problem that would naturally resolve over time as his acting matured, it was a pressing issue for her.

Youngguk paused before giving her the advice she had once given him in his past life.

"I've actually watched all your movies, starting from 'Dawning of the Youth' to 'Ground' and 'Christmas in November.'"

"It's embarrassing. Though I have many films in my filmography for my age, all the roles are similar."

"What's there to be embarrassed about?"

"Excuse me?"

He didn't understand why she felt so ashamed.

"Many actors would give anything to play the roles you've had. If you feel ashamed of your roles, it's a great disrespect to other actors and directors."

"......"

Finally, Son Hwa-won realized that she was ruining herself with her own obsession.

And the next words from Youngguk felt like a splash of cold water on her head.

"Just like a caterpillar molts to become a butterfly, acting is the same. Don't be too bound by the limits you've set for yourself. From what I've seen, you're a much more valuable actor than you think. One day, you'll break through that shell."

At that moment, the assistant director signaled that the stand-by was complete.

Youngguk took a paper cup of beverage from the vending machine and handed it to her.

"Drink this and relax. Sorry if I was too harsh."

Oh, I don't drink coffee. Son Hwa-won almost said aloud.

But this warm cup of coffee felt more precious than ever.

As Youngguk walked away, he turned back and added.

"Next time we meet, speak comfortably, Hwa-won hyung."

Son Hwa-won widened her eyes and gave a short nod. She looked down at the fragrant paper cup.

It wasn't coffee but milky yulmu tea.

'How did he know?'

As she watched Youngguk's receding figure, Son Hwa-won was amazed. How did he know that she liked yulmu tea?
