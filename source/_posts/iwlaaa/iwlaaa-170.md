Prince.

Despite the hotel's name, both its interior and exterior were quite old. In reality, it could be called a motel rather than a hotel.

However, the view from the window was as good as any 5-star hotel. The blue waves unfolding under the drawbridge were reminiscent of Europe.

"This business trip ends today."

It had been a week since he stayed in Yeongdo for preliminary research. Leaving a place that had become almost like home felt more refreshing than sad.

"I feel like I’ve aged five years in just one week, listening to Writer Min's drunken ramblings. Ugh."

There's a saying, "Even the most beautiful scenery should be enjoyed after a meal." Due to the breathtaking views of the coastline and cliffs that are hard to find in Seoul, they drank several times a day. Writer Min's drunken antics were so bizarre that it was harder than dealing with a difficult company boss.

Kim Woo-hyung's hands, folding the clothes he had hand-washed last night, seemed lighter than ever. By the way...

"Jang Youngguk..."

Kim Woo-hyung recalled an incident from a few days ago. Hadn't he met an unexpected person at the location he visited for a preliminary survey? It was actor Jang Youngguk, who was not only famous in Korea but also mingled with world-renowned directors now.

The voice of Writer Min, still drunk, lingered in his mind.

-Kim PD, do you think Jang Youngguk will film with us?

Was this how naive children were?

-But still, Jang Youngguk won the acting award at MBS and is close to the CP, right? Can't we do something?

Drunk, Writer Min had insisted that Kim Woo-hyung somehow recruit Jang Youngguk. If she had been a man instead of a woman, Kim Woo-hyung might have hit her that day.

"You need to say something that makes sense. How are we supposed to recruit Jang Youngguk..."

Even the usually confident voice of Kim Woo-hyung lacked strength. Usually, when it came to drama casting, the broadcasting station was in the superior position.

That was because, for terrestrial dramas, the actors hoping to participate were piled up like mountains.

However, the position could change depending on the actor's fame. For instance, an actor like Jang Youngguk would be the superior among superiors.

"I heard he's close with CP Yoo."

The famous CP was already recognized for his abilities in the MBS drama department. Not only was he the youngest to become a CP, but it was also said that he was already guaranteed the director position in the future.

However, even with a famous CP stepping in, it was uncertain whether it would be possible to recruit an actor of Jang Youngguk's caliber.

"Lotto."

This was a common term floating around the broadcasting industry and Chungmuro these days. If in the past he was called a box-office guarantee, now catching Jang Youngguk was expressed as winning the lottery.

Broadcasting and Chungmuro were so desperate to get Jang Youngguk that it was not an exaggeration.

But would Jang Youngguk appear just because they offered more money?

No way, that wasn't it. Among broadcasting and Chungmuro insiders, Jang Youngguk was often selected as the most unreadable person.

Not only would he sometimes decline even when offered the highest pay, but he also appeared in independent films without accepting any fee at all. This meant he considered only the artistic value of the work.

Of course, some people said it was contradictory to judge a work's artistic value before filming started.

However, the surprising thing was his eye for projects. The works he chose were recognized not only for their commercial success but also for their artistic value. It was almost like he had the foresight to see the future.

As a result, from the perspective of production companies with ample funding, there was no more demanding actor than Jang Youngguk.

"It can't be."

Kim Woo-hyung shook his head vigorously. The saying "Don't even look at a tree you can't climb" wasn't there for nothing.

As a PD himself, he knew how great it would be to cast Jang Youngguk as the lead, but as a broadcasting station employee, he knew how unrealistic that was. Then it happened.

"Kim PD!"

The hotel door swung open without a knock. There stood Writer Min Sujin, panting.

"Writer Min! What if I was changing clothes when you barged in like that!"

"That's not important right now! He came!"

"Who came?"

Who would come all the way to Yeongdo, on the outskirts of Busan, not even Seoul? Just as his curiosity deepened, Writer Min Sujin hurriedly spoke.

"It's Jang Youngguk!"

* * *

"I want to do it."

"Sorry?"

PD Kim Woo-hyung doubted his ears. If his appearance had been caught on camera, the subject would surely be making a dumbfounded expression.

Sitting across from him, Youngguk smiled faintly and repeated his words.

"I want to appear in your project, PD."

Kim Woo-hyung felt his heart racing. The emotions surged more intensely than when he passed the PD selection exam.

Grabbing his trembling heart, he asked again.

"So, are you saying that actor Jang Youngguk wants to appear in the project we are preparing?"

"Yes, that's correct."

"Wow."

Kim Woo-hyung let out an involuntary exclamation. Sitting next to him, Writer Min Sujin was already hiccuping.

"But how did you know about our project?"

"The last time we met, Writer Min handed me the synopsis. When I read it at home, I felt drawn to it. My agency said they could confirm only after seeing the full script."

"So, if the script doesn't turn out well, you might pull out?"

"Sorry if it sounded that way. But I personally found the synopsis very intriguing and would love to be a part of it. If I need to audition, I will."

Audition?

Kim Woo-hyung almost waved his hand. It wasn't enough to bow and scrape to recruit him, but an audition? That was out of the question.

After all, Jang Youngguk's acting skills were already well-known throughout Korea. Even the most demanding critics assessed him as a pillar of the future Korean film industry.

Soon, a voice that woke Kim Woo-hyung from his thoughts was heard.

"Um... I have a favor to ask."

"A favor?"

Kim Woo-hyung wanted to say he could ask for anything. Initially, he considered Jang Youngguk an unattainable star, not even on their recruitment list.

But now that he was within reach, Kim Woo-hyung felt even more anxious. He was worried that Youngguk might change his mind.

"That's okay, feel free to ask. If it's related to your appearance, we will discuss it to meet your needs as much as possible."

Frankly, if they could secure Jang Youngguk, they could do anything. However, keeping his dignity as a public broadcasting PD meant he couldn't lay bare all his feelings.

What could he possibly ask for? Maybe a luxurious waiting room on set, or perhaps adjusting the shooting schedule to his own? Given how much he was in demand. But...

"Is the female lead still open?"

"Yes, we haven't confirmed any cast yet."

"Then..."

The following request was unexpected.

* * *

Incheon Airport.

Amidst the bustling crowd, a girl with a hat pulled down low was visible. She was about to go through the departure process, dragging a suitcase as big as herself.

"Whoo."

Yeonsu was still feeling unsettled, even though it was her departure day. The reason was simple. She had met Yeongguk in Busan.

When she was heading to Busan, she had decided to let go of her feelings for Yeongguk, but instead, her longing for him had only grown.

"Yeonsu?"

Seeing Yeonsu constantly looking back, her mother asked curiously. It was late, but the airport was still crowded.

"Is someone coming to see you off?"

"No, it's nothing like that..."

"You'll be living in the US from now on, and I'm worried. I want to tell you to change your mind, but you've decided so firmly..."

Her mother's face was full of concern. No matter how old a child gets, they still look like a baby to their parents.

It wasn’t a nearby country; she was going to the US to study film directing, so it was natural for her to worry.

"Did you call the CEO?"

"I just did."

"Yes, the CEO was very disappointed. There are a lot of offers for you right now, and you suddenly decided to study abroad..."

She was at the peak of her acting career. The CEO's concern was simple. The transition from a child actor to an adult was crucial.

Especially for a well-known child actor like Yeonsu, the roles she took on as an adult could determine her future success.

But taking a break from acting to study abroad had only two possible outcomes. Either she would make a spectacular comeback, or she would be completely forgotten by the public.

It was still uncertain whether she would receive as many offers after returning from studying abroad as she was getting now.

‘Actually, there’s someone else I want to contact.’

The only person Yeonsu wanted to hear from right now was one person.

However, she didn’t think he would contact her. After all, the kiss in Yeongdo was just a coincidence.

Moreover, she hadn't mentioned her departure date, so he wouldn't know.

"Yeonsu, we have to go through the process now."

At that moment.

Just as the mother and daughter were about to move, a hand was placed on Yeonsu's shoulder. When Yeonsu turned around, her eyes were fixed on one person.

"Oppa...?"

She couldn't believe it. Standing there, sweating, was Yeongguk. Although he wore a hat pulled down low and glasses, Yeonsu couldn't fail to recognize him.

Yeonsu rubbed her eyes with her sleeve and looked again, thinking it might be a dream. But the sight of the sweating Yeongguk only became clearer.

Yeongguk, catching his breath, smiled and said,

"Found you."

"What...?"

"I called your agency to find out when you were leaving. I almost missed you. By the way."

At that moment, Yeongguk knelt on one knee and tied Yeonsu's shoelace. When did it come undone? Although she had grown up, she was still clumsy.

Yeonsu, watching Yeongguk tie her shoelace, blushed unknowingly.

Once might be a coincidence, but twice, it becomes inevitable. Her heart raced.

Seeing the reunion, Yeonsu's mother quietly stepped aside with a grateful look.

"Yeonsu."

At that moment, Yeongguk, who had been kneeling, stood up and spoke. Despite the noise from the crowded airport, his voice reached Yeonsu's ears clearly.

"Can't you stay?"
