"Shoulder is acting up."

Sensitive musicians often suffer from one or two ailments.

Pianists usually suffer from tendonitis due to wrist strain and overwork, while orchestral conductors often suffer from degenerative arthritis from standing in one place for long periods.

In the case of Spencer, the heart of the London Symphony, it was his shoulder rather than his knee that was the problem. Every time he tried to lift the baton, it felt like someone was pressing down on his shoulder.

"Having worked as the maestro of the London Symphony for half a lifetime, it's only natural that your body can't take it anymore. Others call you an emotionless machine or a cold perfectionist, but I know you're more hardworking than anyone."

"Samuel, hearing such praise from you feels odd."

Prince Samuel of the UK and Maestro Spencer had been friends since childhood. Their bond, which began at the royal school, continued into their middle age.

Given their close friendship, it was no exaggeration to say that they knew each other's personalities better than anyone.

"Then, should we consider another orchestra for the royal performance?"

"That's out of the question!"

Wasn't it a celebratory performance to announce the new birth of the royal family? Following Samuel, it was the birth of the legitimate heir who would be responsible for the British royal family.

Since it was a performance held by the royal family, its significance was exceptional. It could never be taken by another orchestra.

"Spencer, are you thinking of a guest conductor?"

"Of course. I will select a conductor who passes my strict scrutiny."

"Strict scrutiny?"

Samuel knew how much of a perfectionist his friend was.

In Europe, it's rare to have an assistant conductor. Therefore, sometimes a guest conductor fills in for the conductor's absence. However, guest conductors who had passed through the London Symphony had all been left speechless.

"Was it last year? An American conductor took the stage in your place."

"Are you talking about the guy who fled back to America as soon as the performance ended?"

"Yes, didn't he book a ticket to America as soon as the London Symphony performance ended? He looked so gaunt, as if he had been through a war. Those who have guest-conducted the London Symphony have all said it felt like facing hell."

Spencer snorted. On days when his shoulder was bad, a guest conductor occasionally took the stage. That day, a guy from America had come.

The orchestras in America and Europe differ in nuances and symphony interpretations. Grasping and adapting to this in a short time was beyond effort; it was a matter of talent.

Moreover, who could relax under Spencer's intense guidance?

"There was one guy who wasn't nervous."

Spencer smiled faintly as he remembered someone.

* * *

"Hyun, aren't you nervous?"

Baek Junghoon looked puzzled. It was an invitation from Korea University College of Music. Chairwoman Im Hyera thought it was a good opportunity.

Among those majoring in music, Kang Hyun and Baek Junghoon had many fans. Moreover, the fact that Kang Hyun had given lectures at prestigious music colleges abroad was well-known among musicians. Shouldn't there be no discrimination between domestic and overseas activities?

"Is there a need to be nervous?"

"What?"

"Hyung, act boldly like when you play the piano. A lecture is nothing special. It's just a time to address the questions of the audience. The ones who should be nervous and excited are the people waiting for us."

In a way, he wasn't wrong.

Had Kang Hyun and Baek Junghoon ever moved together? The auditorium of Korea University College of Music was said to be packed with undergraduate students. But wasn't Kang Hyun someone who had passed through Moscow and Juilliard?

Moreover, with the added experience of his past life, he looked as relaxed as if he were going on an outing.

"It's been a while."

Kang Hyun was lost in thought, looking at the scenery outside the car window. Hadn't he attended Korea University School of Law in his past life?

Familiar campus scenery and buildings came into view. Surely, passing through the small side gate after the Engineering College building, there would be a snack shop known for its delicious pork stir-fry.

"Oh? Driver, you need to turn right here."

"The sign says this way."

"No, it's not."

Due to the vast campus of Korea University, one had to move around by car even within the campus. Sometimes the wooden signs were reversed, which was a prank played by upperclassmen to tease the freshmen.

Baek Junghoon felt the curious gaze directed at him. Kang Hyun, with a sly expression, said he had thoroughly read the 'pamphlet with the campus map.'

"By the way, Hyun, did you finish that score?"

"Which score are you talking about?"

"The one where you kept changing the musical ideas. The one where the forte subtly transitions into a pianissimo!"

Kang Hyun immediately understood which piece Baek Junghoon was talking about.

It was a piece with wildly fluctuating musical ideas, like watching a plot-twist movie. It was the piece he had composed with his grandfather in mind. Wasn't it the unfinished score because the musical ideas weren't complete?

But now, he could finally place a fermata on the double bar line.

"Hyun, have you thought about which university you'll attend?"

It was the same question his uncle had asked before. But he didn't feel the need to attend a university in Korea. After all, didn't Baek Junghoon also graduate from the Paris Conservatoire?

Just then, the car arrived at the building where the College of Music's auditorium was located.

"Hyun, come to think of it, you seem taller?"

"Really?"

"Yes, last year, you didn't even reach my shoulder."

Baek Junghoon walked side by side with Kang Hyun, measuring his height with his hand. Kang Hyun smiled with satisfaction. It seemed like his growth plates were starting to open up.

But the small talk didn't last long. As they arrived at the auditorium, they were greeted with a heated atmosphere.

"There are more people than I thought."

As Baek Junghoon said, the auditorium was packed with undergraduate students. Even the professors who had come out to greet them had taken seats, filling the spacious auditorium with no empty spots.

It turned out that music students from other universities had also come to hear the lecture.

"Hello, I'm violinist Kang Hyun."

Kang Hyun took the microphone first, replacing the nervous Baek Junghoon. He thought he had to break the ice first so Baek Junghoon could start.

The students' eyes were filled with curiosity. Looking back, even reporters with cameras were present.

To give Baek Junghoon time to relax, Kang Hyun asked the students if they had any questions.

"I'm Park Sooyeon, a 97th class student of the Department of Orchestral Instruments at Korea University. I'm a big fan of Kang Hyun. If it's not too personal, can I ask the first question?"

"It's fine, the lecture hasn't started yet."

Just as he was curious about what kind of musical question would come from the freshman's mouth,

"Do you have a girlfriend, Kang Hyun?"

A completely unexpected question came from the female student's mouth.

Grandfather's study had a unique scent. Should I call it the scent of time from old books and LP records? The worn-out bookshelf and sofa bore the traces of my grandfather's personality.

As I lay down on the old sofa, it sank in, wrapping around me like a sigh.

"You gave a lecture at Korea University?"

"Yes, Grandfather."

"How was it? Isn't it the place where the brightest minds in Korea gather?"

Indeed, there was a saying that if you want to see the future of Korea, look up at Korea University.

But didn't the first question make me sweat all over? In some ways, it was more flustering than Moscow or Juilliard.

Once I got past the first question, fortunately, I could breathe easier.

"Think of it more as an exchange than a lecture. I didn't know there were so many people in Korea who liked and studied classical music. It was only an hour, but it felt so short I didn't want to leave the podium."

It wasn't an exaggeration. Even Baek Junghoon, who had been highly tense, got so excited as the conversation with the students continued that he wouldn't put the microphone down.

Grandfather looked at me, raising his head from the documents he was checking.

"Hyun, what do you want to do in the future?"

It was an unexpected question. Hadn't Grandfather's wit successfully handled the matter at Dongju Chemical?

Before I could take any significant action, Grandfather had already bought up the shares of my small uncle and aunt, and even set a trap for my big uncle.

It seemed that the skyrocketing stock price of Barbara Mining would unintentionally fatten my wallet.

"Grandfather, I've been thinking a lot while lying down. I've heard from writer Im that famous professors and musicians abroad are looking for me."

Grandfather's eyes showed clear signs of concern. Understandably so, as his grandson had made contracts with a Jewish chairman in a far-off foreign land because of him.

To anyone else, it would sound like a series of unbelievable stories. Grandfather must have been convinced that I was bearing an enormous burden that no one else could easily handle.

"Grandfather, I know exactly what I want to do. So, you don't have to worry."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes, and don't I have to win the bet with Yooha's Grandfather?"

Grandfather looked into my eyes and smiled faintly.

Grab.

I held Grandfather's wrinkled hand. While Grandfather was bedridden, I became certain of one thing.

Just like in my past life, the flawed personalities of my uncles and aunt didn't change at all. If they saw even a tiny gap, they would try to devour Dongju, so I couldn't let my guard down.

I understood Grandfather's concerns, but there was still one person left to deal with. I couldn't give up on music either. To do that,

"Grandfather, I will protect Dongju until the end."

I had to become stronger.

Dmitri, the concertmaster of the London Symphony, was on a plane to Korea.

The reason he chose to go to Korea was simple. He had to meet someone in Korea to replace the maestro with a shoulder injury.

At that moment, a boy's image flowed through his cold eyes.

"Maestro Hyun."

It was strange to attach the title of maestro to a young violinist who wasn't even a virtuoso, but it didn't feel awkward. Perhaps because he had already experienced his conducting once.

Dmitri knew well what the royal celebration performance meant in the UK. In a way, it was like playing for the emperor at the Kremlin Palace in Moscow in the past.

"I wonder if he'll be the youngest, Hyun."

It was not a rehearsal but an official stage. Maestro Spencer had invited not only Kang Hyun but also selected one conductor from Europe, America, and China.

Eager not to miss the opportunity, they all eagerly boarded flights to England. Thus, it was very unusual for concertmaster Dmitri to come to Korea himself.

"Excuse me, can I have some ramen?"

Dmitri asked the flight attendant with a glimmer of hope. He still vividly remembered the taste of the ramen Hyun had cooked as a late-night snack. After all, wasn't this a Korean airline? The flight attendant brought the ramen with a bright smile.

"Blagodaryu vas (Thank you)!"

Dmitri unconsciously answered in his native language at the sight of the red broth. It was a dish that had been lingering in his mind for a while.

The flight attendant provided chopsticks and a fork, but Dmitri picked up the noodles with the chopsticks he had learned to use.

Meanwhile, a Korean woman sitting in the next business class seat smacked her lips, seeing a foreigner enjoy spicy ramen so much.

Dmitri, who had polished off the broth down to the last drop, wiped his lips with a tissue as if nothing had happened. Then he took out a notebook from his inside pocket.

It was his first time traveling to Korea alone without any interpreter. Fortunately, he already knew where Hyun's studio and mansion were located. Nevertheless, he planned to learn basic Korean.

"Hyunie oppa."

Dmitri kept repeating the Korean term of respect for Hyun that Maestro Spencer had written down.
