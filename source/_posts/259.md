"Old man, have you been secretly eating ginseng these days?"

Chairman Wang said while watching the golf ball fly in a perfect arc.

Time had passed, but somehow Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo seemed to be getting even stronger. They had been making rounds since the morning, but instead of getting tired, their competitive spirit only burned brighter with each hole.

"You're one to talk. Your drives easily exceed 300 yards. Have you been secretly taking long-distance lessons?"

"I barely have time to learn Go, let alone golf. Who would run the company?"

"Why are you learning Go anyway? I noticed you've improved a lot."

"I'm trying to beat my talented grandson-in-law!"

Chairman Yoo let out a chuckle. To beat his grandson Kang Hyun in Go, he would need at least a professional-level player.

Among amateurs, his skills were top-notch. Just then, Chairman Wang's swing sent the golf ball slicing through the air.

"That's a drop!"

Chairman Yoo shouted as the ball got sucked into the water hazard. But then, Chairman Wang took off his golf shoes and even his socks, much to the caddies' surprise.

"Mr. Son, are you trying to imitate Park Seri to avoid a penalty?"

It was reminiscent of Park Seri, who had taken off her socks and stepped into a pond to take a shot during the U.S. Women's Open.

The caddies looked unsure of what to do, but Chairman Yoo seemed to find it an amusing spectacle.

Chairman Wang was the same. His competitive spirit was as strong as a 20-year-old's, if not more so, compared to renowned golfers.

However…

Thunk!

The golf club missed the ball and tore into the grass instead. His swing was too stiff. The outcome was obvious.

Sizzle―!

After the golf game, lunch was always chicken galbi. Watching the chicken galbi cook to a golden brown on the grill, Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo raised their glasses to each other.

To a stranger, they might look like village grandpas enjoying soju after a hike. In reality, they were bigwigs in the business world.

"Mr. Son, when do you think would be a good time for Hyun and Yooha's engagement ceremony?"

"Old man, you had nothing to say when I was pushing for the engagement, so why the sudden change?"

"Now that the kids are running the companies well, I can relax. Before, even lying down at home was uncomfortable. If I hadn't met Kang, I would have regretted it forever."

Kang was practically running Dongju Chemical on behalf of Chairman Yoo. The progress of Dongju was so remarkable that it was hard to believe he once ran a humble neighborhood laundry.

Chairman Yoo attributed all this to his grandson. Meeting Kang Hyun had helped him reconcile with his estranged youngest daughter after many years.

Without Kang Hyun, his stubbornness would have kept him from seeing his youngest daughter Hyunja again before he died. Just then,

"Mr. Son."

Chairman Wang said, slamming his soju glass down.

"Do we really need an engagement ceremony?"

"Why the change of heart now?"

"That's not what I mean. Yooha will soon be an adult, won't she?"

Chairman Wang knew very well that many in the business and political spheres were eyeing Hyun as a potential son-in-law.

As Hyun's true value became more apparent, more people would approach him blatantly. He couldn't afford to just stand by and watch.

Why give them a respite with an engagement ceremony? Chairman Wang's next words nearly made Chairman Yoo spit out his soju.

"Mr. Son, why don't we skip the engagement and go straight to the wedding?"

Hotaru, a seventeen-year-old boy from Nagoya, Japan, was the youngest of the 12 violinists selected for the chapel.

Moreover, his small stature and youthful Asian appearance made him look even younger than his age.

"Hotaru, who do you think is the most likely winner of this chapel?"

At the producer's question, Hotaru gulped. It was his first time on a broadcast, and he was extremely nervous.

The producer smiled warmly, like a kind aunt. Hotaru was just too cute.

"Well, I don't think I'm skilled enough to evaluate others…."

"Oh, come on, you're being too modest."

"No, really. I think it was sheer luck that I made it into the twelve. Every violinist I've met at the chapel has been incredibly talented."

In truth, the most likely winners were probably Anna from Russia and Sabrina from the UK.

Hotaru knew this but refrained from saying it out loud out of consideration for the other violinists.

Moreover, objectively speaking, his skills were the lowest among the 12 violinists, so evaluating others felt uncomfortable.

"But there must be someone who stands out. Just name one person."

The producer secretly hoped Hotaru would point out a female violinist. Even though it was a documentary, hinting at a budding love line wouldn't hurt the ratings.

However, the answer that followed made the producer doubt his ears.

"Actually, there is one person."

"Who?"

"Violinist Hyun, who is a judge."

Hotaru's admiration for Kang Hyun was simple. He was the only judge who identified all the problems and strengths of the performances on the main stage.

His advice was given to both those who passed and those who didn't. Hotaru was in awe of Kang Hyun's insights.

It was as if he could see right into his heart and understand everything.

-Hotaru, your performance reminded me of the second movement of the Sibelius Concerto. It was calm, lyrical, yet filled with melancholy. I love such unconventional performances. There's no need to conform strictly to the composer's interpretation. As a musician, you must have a strong sense of self, as long as you can make the audience understand. In that regard, your bold performance was clear to me.

Hotaru had grown up being called a violin prodigy in Nagoya, Japan. Coincidentally, he was from the same hometown as the queen of violin, Hirose, and was often called the second Hirose.

But seeing Kang Hyun made him feel ashamed.

Kang Hyun had won the Queen Elisabeth Competition at a much younger age and was conducting for the British royal family at Hotaru's age. His talent was beyond imagination.

"What do you think of Judge Kang Hyun, Hotaru?"

At the producer's question, Hotaru fell silent. He couldn't dare to evaluate someone like Kang Hyun.

At that moment, the cameraman zoomed in on Hotaru's blushing face.

This is impossible.

Kang Hyun couldn't sleep properly. The spacious room, reminiscent of a suite, didn't help. The loud snoring of Viktor, like a ship's horn, echoed through the ceiling all night. He felt like pinching Viktor's hooked nose with a clothespin while he slept.

"Did you not sleep well?"

Whether Viktor knew his feelings or not, he teased Kang Hyun early in the morning. But Kang Hyun, too exhausted to respond, just nodded shortly and headed to the shower.

Damn it!

Had he known, he would have refused Yugo's proposal at all costs. The dark circles under his eyes were prominent.

After showering, Kang Hyun barely ate breakfast and tried to shake off his drowsiness with coffee.

"Kang Hyun, today is the day you teach the violinists, right?"

The producer, who had appeared out of nowhere with a camera, started filming Kang Hyun.

"Yes."

"How many do you think will come?"

"It's hard to judge since they choose based on the assigned piece, not the judge. I think a moderate number would be good."

The piece Kang Hyun was in charge of was a Paganini performance. Due to the nature of the piece, which required not only fast playing but also flashy techniques, the number of applicants would likely be small.

Kang Hyun headed to the practice room where the violinists were waiting. Two violinists were already waiting for him.

"Anna?"

And.

"Sabrina?"

It was unexpected, but both were violinists Kang Hyun knew.

Conscious of the cameras, Kang Hyun refrained from showing familiarity. Sabrina, too, didn't treat Kang Hyun as casually as she did at the Royal Academy of Music, aware that he was a judge.

"Let's get started."

Kang Hyun, momentarily forgetting his drowsiness, smiled.

Maria, the producer of Belgium's national broadcaster RTBF, couldn't wipe the satisfied smile off her face as she reviewed the footage.

She had been watching the footage for hours, forgetting she needed to edit it.

The Queen Elisabeth Competition.

An international competition that had become a national event in Belgium.

In the past, the semifinals were broadcast live, but for the past decade, the finals had been produced as a documentary and aired.

If you think documentaries are boring, you'd be mistaken.

This year's Queen Elisabeth Competition was so competitive that it had the highest number of applicants ever.

The skills of the new violinists had improved remarkably.

Moreover, the fact that the youngest winner of the Queen Elisabeth Competition seven years ago, violinist Hyun, was invited as a judge was a big topic.

"He's really amazing."

Kang Hyun was the only one who gave advice to participants, whether they passed or not, on the main stage.

Other judges also provided additional advice, but none did it as detailed as Kang Hyun.

"He's truly a genius."

The more she watched the recordings, the more Maria realized that Kang Hyun was a genius.

After seeing a performance just once, he could diagnose all the problems like a CT scan.

It wasn't just the participants who were surprised. The other judges, all renowned figures, couldn't hide their amazement either.

"This is perfect."

The final footage showed Kang Hyun mentoring young violinists at the chapel.

With platinum blonde and white-haired beauties around him, Kang Hyun mentoring looked like a scene from a movie.

Moreover, the mentoring content was top-notch. He was pinpointing and correcting the issues of already renowned young violinists like a magician.

When this scene aired, it was sure to stir up the classical music world again.
