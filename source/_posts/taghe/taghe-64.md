## Episode 64: The Condition of Completion

Kang Lim was unchanged from the time he impressed Gu Haeyoung during the entrance exam.

Even with countless works laid out, this kid always stood out. Because he shone alone.

Back then, when asked to draw spheres representing art, politics, society, science... and various fields.

While other students focused on one problem, this kid always read the big picture.

One work that encompassed and penetrated all issues.

Hence, an aura that felt like truth...

Kang Lim was not lacking to be presented to the world.

'A work that depicts a world where love has disappeared...'

Gu Haeyoung was just overwhelmed with mixed emotions, not knowing how to express them.

A new format that combines paintings, sculptures, and stories.

At the end of the story, a question is posed, involving the audience in completing the work.

The audience goes beyond passive appreciation and becomes involved in creating the work itself.

In other words, it is a work of interactive communication, not one-way.

Who could create such a genre?

This was a unique field that combined Kang Lim's strengths.

"Uh, Professor, are you feeling unwell?"

Kang Lim was puzzled, seeing Gu Haeyoung standing silently with his back turned for ten minutes since entering the lab.

Usually, he looked so vigorous that it was hard to believe his old age...

But today, his usually firm shoulders somehow seemed fragile.

"No, that's not it. I was just amazed by your work."

Gu Haeyoung spoke in a trembling voice, unable to calm down.

His voice cracked under the weight of his emotions.

Meanwhile, Kang Lim was inwardly touched by Gu Haeyoung's changed tone.

'There's a rumor that the professor only speaks informally to students he truly acknowledges as artists...'

Gu Haeyoung used honorifics with students to maintain distance.

Because there were too many people wanting to flatter him to open exhibitions.

As expected, Gu Haeyoung spoke again.

It was what Kang Lim had longed to hear.

"You are already an artist."

Gu Haeyoung turned around and approached Kang Lim.

Exchanging meaningful glances with someone who had moved him.

It was something he always did after seeing a good work.

After taking a breath, Gu Haeyoung said,

"You are not a raw gem. You are already a finished diamond."

"Thank you. But hearing something like that from you all of a sudden, I don't know how to respond..."

"No, it's true. I'm not just saying it to compliment you. You are different from other artists. This is because you've created a new genre. There has never been an artist who uses stories to involve the audience directly in their work like you. It's modern yet made for the public to engage with."

"But..."

"No, this is amazing. I'll recommend you for the Venice Biennale with this work. This is a work that the world needs to see. Imagine everyone giving different answers and sharing their reasons. You intended to display all the collected answers, right?"

"Ah, yes. I planned to gather everyone's opinions and display them on the wall later. But... the Biennale...?"

"It will be incredible. This is a hundred percent a controversial work. You'll become greater than me."

"What?"

Kang Lim was a bit flustered.

Despite everything, could a young, green artist like him really surpass a renowned master...? It felt presumptuous... He was embarrassed.

And what was this about the Venice Biennale?

Even after a lifetime of work, it's hard to be selected as a representative of Korea, but to do so at twenty...

Kang Lim was at a loss for words, his previously composed demeanor slightly faltering.

Gu Haeyoung smirked as he watched Kang Lim.

How could someone so genius be so pure, how adorable.

Even when the world notices him later, with wealth and fame following him, could he maintain such purity and passion?

Gu Haeyoung believed Kang Lim could, because he loved art.

Without love, one couldn't work until they were so pale and exhausted.

He must have stayed up several nights, driven by the sole desire to communicate with many people.

With a slight smile, Gu Haeyoung said,

"This year’s theme for the Korean Pavilion is 'Love.' Your work, which sings of a world where love has vanished, fits perfectly. Quite paradoxically, of course."

"......"

"You always aimed to communicate with the public, hence this unique genre was created. The audience will share different opinions and reflect on your work, pondering what went wrong."

"But weren't the artists for next year already decided? The Biennale is held every two years..."

"Coincidentally, one person dropped out of the group exhibition, so they need another artist. You must fill that spot."

Kang Lim cleared his throat and spoke, swallowing nervously to hide his surprise.

"...Honestly, I also wanted to meet many people with this work. Different answers and reasons will emerge based on gender, age, race, nationality, and religion.

I wanted to gather as many opinions as possible, and the Biennale would satisfy that. Truly, it's a heaven-sent opportunity for me. Frankly, I'm thrilled even though it's not confirmed yet."

Receiving such an honor.

The price of his work soaring.

These were not the reasons; Kang Lim expressed his goal of meeting many people worldwide.

Gu Haeyoung particularly liked that aspect.

So, he decided to ask the question he was curious about.

"Kang Lim."

"Yes, Professor."

"I'm curious about one thing. What is your answer to the final question left in your work? You must have decided it when you created the piece."

Kang Lim was taken aback by the unexpected question.

He never anticipated the professor would ask such a thing.

Kang Lim's works were characterized by having questions but no answers.

Their mystery lay in never converging on one meaning.

That's where the aura emanated.

As Kang Lim hesitated, Gu Haeyoung laughed and said,

"Haha, I'm an artist before I'm a professor. How could I not understand your mind? Artists are cautious even when titling their works. A specific title limits its meaning. So, it must be hard for you to give an answer."

"...Yes, that's why I even changed the title of the work. It wasn't originally <The Woman's Bag>."

"You changed the title?"

"Yes, the original title was <The Truth Silently Flaunts Itself Today>. Hypocrisy and lies are always upfront, but the truth hides. That's the state of the world."

"Indeed."

"But titling the work like that seemed to overly emphasize the keyword 'truth.' It felt like my intended answer would be too obvious. However, in this work, the audience's answers matter, not my opinion or theme. I just depicted a world where even love could become a lie. Because what's lacking in the world is love."

"What hidden answer is so delicately set like that? I thought the previous title was good too."

"No. Instead of including any explicit meaning in the title, I wanted to evoke curiosity. Like, 'So what's in the bag?'"

"So it ended up being <The Woman's Bag>."

"Yes, I hope this work morphs into thousands of pieces when seen by thousands of viewers. Creating a space to share the answers and reasons people provide. That's the ultimate goal and theme of the work. To discuss what's false and what's wrong with each other. Then, we can encounter all the world's problems. The reason love has vanished."

Gu Haeyoung understood Kang Lim's intent.

Good works give rise to infinite interpretations and meanings.

"Of course, there will be people who think exactly like me. But there's a huge difference between me stating the answer and the audience saying it. The moment the artist speaks, it’s perceived almost as truth. Because I'm the creator... I dislike that."

"I understand. Once a work leaves the artist's hands, it’s no longer the artist's. It’s reborn through the audience's interpretation."

"But why..."

"I wanted to understand how deep your thoughts go. I promise I won't tell anyone, I'll take it to my grave."

"Really?"

"Haha, yes. I promise."

"Fine."

Maybe he was making too much of a fuss today, was it really necessary?

Kang Lim reflected on himself, feeling a bit embarrassed, and said,

"Ahem, sorry if I seemed overly dramatic."

"Haha, it's fine. It's natural. I felt the same when I made my most cherished work."

"Yes, in fact... There's nothing false in that story. God, the scales, and love in the bag were all true. That's why I allowed 'Other Opinions' to be written below the three options. So people could share thoughts beyond the given choices. My answer is also an 'Other Opinion.'"

"Why is that?"

"Professor, look closely at the beginning of the story. The scales were tilted, but God never said it was a scale measuring something valuable. It could have been a scale measuring the weight of evil. No one knew the criteria.

But people naturally looked at the lowered side and thought it was something God valued most."

"......"

"Afterward, people placed what they valued most and felt disappointed. Doubt spread after the woman's bag incident. Then groups divided, hatred grew, and even murders occurred. Eventually, love itself was doubted."

Gu Haeyoung shook his head at Kang Lim's ingenious thought.

It was so ridiculous he almost couldn't laugh.

"But, as I said earlier, my answer is not the correct one. It's just the creator's story. I'm a twenty-year-old Korean who’s never been betrayed by love."

"Haha, indeed."

"This work is about the various factors in people's environments that create lies. For example, in some countries, people die every year from ritual circumcision practices. Scholars studying that culture might say the scale's standard was wrong. And if someone was abused, they might say the claim that love was in the bag was false, because they distrust human words. Displaying these different answers and reasons together will reveal all the world's problems."

"Yes... you're right..."

"People see the world through their experiences. And when everyone's thoughts and experiences are shared, that’s when this work is finally complete. It’s still unfinished, as people haven't participated yet."

"Your work always includes people. Even though it's modern art. It's something I've never seen before. It will be the first."

Seeing Gu Haeyoung nod quietly, Kang Lim exhaled deeply.

He felt like the hard work he had put in was coming to a conclusion.

His physical condition was also extremely exhausted...

He wanted to go home and rest a bit now.

Gu Haeyoung also knew that Kang Lim looked like he could collapse with a push.

As if he was on the verge of dying from overwork.

"Now, you should go home and rest."

"Yes, I have a solo exhibition opening the day after tomorrow, and I don't want to meet people looking like this."

"Yes, I saw the brochure you left. That work was also excellent. The exhibition theme <24 Seasonal Emotions> was really good."

"Thank you. But... Professor, will you come? It's better to see it in person."

"Puhaha... Sorry, but I can't attend the opening. Maybe next week."

"It's a month-long exhibition, so just coming is enough. I'll be at the gallery often."

"Alright. I'll let you know once the Biennale participation is confirmed. There will be good news."

"Thank you."

Gu Haeyoung was already preparing a presentation in his mind to explain the artist Kang Lim. A story to block any objections from the Biennale planning team.

Of course, Kang Lim was thinking about his upcoming solo exhibition.

To him, meeting many people worldwide was just as important as meeting people in Korea.
