## Episode 31: Issue Maker

"Americano is ready."

"Thank you."

Kang Lim skimmed through the file while sipping the Americano handed to him by the clerk.

Upon seeing the artworks, it was clear that Sensation Agency simply enjoyed stirring up controversy.

Their works were all about creating provocative and sexual imagery, under the guise of seemingly convincing arguments like, "The taboo culture around sex needs to change. Sexual instincts of human beings should be respected."

The explanations of the works were shoddy, the form was unappealing, and the painting was a mess...

It was utterly pathetic.

If they were well-made, I wouldn't have said anything.

"So? Think you can do something like that? Something a bit innovative and radical. When I was at Goldsmiths, I saw a lot of those. You know the school where Damien Hirst came from, right? I graduated from there. We want something shocking like that. Since you’re in fine arts, I assume you have an open mind."

"......"

As Kang Lim flipped through the pages, Hong Yunki tapped his fingers on the desk.

Every time the luxury watch on his wrist gleamed, Kang Lim's curiosity grew.

‘Come to think of it, both of them are strange.’

Lee Hyerim studied in Cranbrook, USA, and Hong Yunki in Goldsmiths, UK.

Both schools require hefty tuition fees.

‘While many European universities hardly charge tuition, studying in the US and UK costs a fortune. Why are they running this kind of business then? Looking at the recommended works, it doesn’t seem like they are trying to do something for the public, nor are they new artists like me trying to build a career…’

Eventually, Kang Lim put down his Americano and opened his mouth.

"Why are you two participating in this business? The participation fee for artists is only 1 million won. The budget for this project is small, so I don’t understand why a large agency is involved."

Each team selected for this street art exhibition project receives a budget of 6 million won.

In an era where even making a proper sign costs over 2 million won, creating an outdoor sculpture with 6 million won was not an easy task.

In short, the budget was tight.

“Oh, Kang Lim, you’re so naive. Is it because you’re twenty?”

Lee Hyerim seemed a bit surprised by Kang Lim's question.

Hong Yunki paused for a moment before bursting into loud laughter.

His laugh was so loud that it shook the coffee cup Kang Lim was holding.

“Hahaha. Do you think we are participating just for the 1 million won artist support fee?”

“Then what’s the real reason?”

“Our goal is to keep winning these public projects set up by local governments. Building up such a track record makes it easier to win contracts for sculptures in front of buildings.”

Ah, now I get it. Their true intentions...

Kang Lim listened while savoring the bitter aftertaste of the coffee on his tongue.

“You may not know this because you’re still young, but you’ve seen sculptures in front of large buildings, right?”

He wanted to say, ‘Of course,’ but instead, he nodded.

Hong Yunki's sarcastic expression was fascinating to observe.

How could his eyebrows dance like that?

“That’s because of the public art installation law enacted in the 1980s. Buildings with a total floor area of more than 10,000 square meters are required by law to install art. If constructing a building costs 15 billion won, 150 million won must be spent on artwork. That’s 1% of the building cost.”

“I know.”

Fed up, Kang Lim retorted coldly, startling Hong Yunki.

“Oh, um? You know. Anyway, building a good track record in these Seoul city support projects makes it easier to win those contracts. If you land five of those, just imagine the money. Let’s do well this time so you can earn a share too. I think you have enough skill.”

“But isn’t the purpose of that law to help people encounter art on the streets and introduce works by unknown sculptors? Isn’t it far from the intention for design firms to monopolize it?”

“Pfft. Are you doing volunteer work? Of course. Do you know how much brokers who introduce artists to building owners make? In reality, who installs works by emerging artists? It’s either famous artists or firms monopolizing the market.

We just need to make good pitches for brokers. ‘This firm has won the Seoul outdoor sculpture installation project. So, building owner, you should choose this firm.’ That kind of stuff.”

Damn. So that’s why there are so many ridiculously crude statues on the streets...

Kang Lim shook his head.

It was a pity for building owners too.

Having to pay a fortune to install a hideous artwork because of the law.

Moreover, large installations are hard to remove once installed.

It costs an enormous amount of money to dismantle, so they often end up with artworks they don’t like, which frequently become dirty due to poor maintenance.

“Filling dreary streets with culture and art to turn the city into a museum... That goal is completely far-fetched. A total failure.”

“Ha, Kang Lim? You’re so naive. You’re amazed at the obvious. But honestly, it’s not just the art world that’s like this. Laws have always been like this. Minimum moral standards? Correcting societal disorder? Justice is always good.

But in reality, laws are there to reduce sentences for criminals and create loopholes for the wealthy. That’s how the world works! You’re still young, so you don’t know.”

‘This guy keeps calling me young without even knowing how old I am.’

Kang Lim found Hong Yunki, who was munching on quiche while making nonsensical self-justifications, utterly repulsive.

He hated the way he justified himself while stuffing his face.

Now, even the cafe with air conditioning on the outdoor terrace seemed absurd.

Cold wind mixed with sweltering heat, creating a fishy and contradictory atmosphere.

“Not all people in the art world are like that. Please don’t generalize. Anyway, if you want works similar to those in this file, I can’t work with you.”

As Kang Lim stood up abruptly, both Hong Yunki and Lee Hyerim flinched.

They couldn’t understand why he would walk away from a clear opportunity to make a lot of money.

"Kang Lim, please sit down."

Lee Hyerim grabbed Kang Lim’s wrist and spoke.

"The professor insisted that we work together and come up with ideas. If you drop out like this, it would be really problematic for us."

"No, I don’t want to do this kind of work."

Hong Yunki grumbled, trying to hide his surprised expression.

"Aren’t you being too narrow-minded for an artist? There are people who exhibit animals cut open and paint while naked. Stirring up controversy is also a trend in the art world."

Kang Lim sighed at Hong Yunki’s ignorance.

Studying abroad doesn’t mean you understand art.

"You’re speaking without considering the historical context at all. And those kinds of works have already been done in the 1960s. Doing that now? It would just be a poor imitation."

"…Tch."

Hong Yunki puffed his cheeks in frustration, while Lee Hyerim tried to soothe Kang Lim.

"Actually, since we joined the agency, we haven’t achieved much and are at risk of being kicked out. Please understand, Kang Lim. What Yunki said is just his own opinion. The professor wanted you to lead this project."

Of course. There’s no reason Han Jungpil would support such a fool.

Being older doesn’t make one a veteran; the mistake was mine from the start...

Kang Lim sighed slightly and looked at Lee Hyerim.

"Kang Lim, we have our reasons too. The winning works in this competition have all been sexual and provocative. You saw the works from Sensation Agency..."

"That’s why it’s strange. Is there corruption among the judges?"

"No. You know the evaluation is 50% public vote."

"Exactly. There’s no way people voted for stuff like that."

"Uh, it works like this."

Lee Hyerim turned on her phone and clicked on a random portal article on the main page.

"Look at the comments selected as best."

"Yes, I saw."

"No, the number of likes and dislikes."

"Yes, I saw."

"If there are many antis, there are also many fans... The comments with the most dislikes have the most likes. In short, creating an issue increases the chances of getting more votes. The competition votes can only like on the website."

"Ah..."

Now, Kang Lim understood the ridiculous winning results.

It was simply a matter of exposure difference.

"So, you’re saying we should make something like that too?"

"Then what else can we do? We need to create an issue to win..."

"No, there are various kinds of people. Even famous programs for selecting singers have only a few dedicated voters... Who would vote in such an unknown exhibition with poor publicity? Because of the opinions of just a few hundred people, the majority of citizens suffer visual pollution."

"Yes, we know..."

Seeing Lee Hyerim shrink suddenly, Kang Lim swallowed his frustration.

He was utterly suffocated.

"And I don’t do such vulgar and crude works. I don’t want to either."

"......"

That was true.

Just as actors carefully select good works to build a perfect filmography, artists must also be cautious in building their exhibition careers.

Becoming an artist who sold out their conscience would mean no sponsorship from major companies later on.

You don’t do art to make money.

Money follows art naturally.

There are no companies in Korea supporting artists who have reversed their priorities to go global.

"The image of Pilseung Agency will also suffer. Even if I try to think along those lines, nothing comes to mind. Therefore, trying to win with such works is just a loss. You can’t win against people who specialize in vulgarity."

At Kang Lim’s firm tone, Lee Hyerim clasped her hands and spoke.

"But we really have to win this time..."

Listening quietly, Hong Yunki also opened his mouth.

Unlike earlier, his expression now seemed quite deflated.

"Then what are you going to make... How will you beat that issue maker?"

Why are you asking me that?

Seeing the two deflated people, Kang Lim was at a loss for words.

They were all bluster but lacked confidence.

I thought I came to learn and gain experience from veterans like in the previous group exhibitions...

But no. This was another group project assigned by Han Jungpil.

And I had to carry the team again...

"Let’s do the opposite. It’s public art, so let’s make something truly for the public. Fair and square. Maybe then we’ll have a chance."

We couldn’t turn the vibrant street of Hongdae into a place people don’t want to walk on.

The aim was to revitalize the young street and enjoy the festive scene... We couldn’t defile it.

"How! Tell me how!"

Hong Yunki shouted so loudly that people in the cafe started to stare.

His voice and expression were equally exasperating.

"......"

Kang Lim stared coldly at Hong Yunki.

"Next time, instead of meeting in a cool place like this, let’s walk around the streets where we can actually install things. Let’s mingle with people and find out what’s really needed."

In a calm tone, Hong Yunki fell silent.

‘Why does this twenty-year-old feel like my senior...’

The more he saw Kang Lim, the more trust he felt.

Especially his deep eyes and trustworthy low voice.

"At least, let’s avoid hearing, ‘It’s better to plant a tree than to erect such a sculpture.’"
