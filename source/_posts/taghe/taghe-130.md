## Episode 130 Festival

"I have completed the painting project that I usually work on. Whatever the project, it's my 'freedom.'"

A presentation given with a blank expression in front of numerous canvases.

Kang Lim and Baudouin burst into laughter seeing Shin Taemin's face.

It was just so typical of Shin Taemin.

‘Well, he has his pride. Just because the assignment has a theme, he's not the type to create something unrelated to his usual work and give it meaning.'

Kang Lim watched the students critiquing.

Perhaps thanks to the honest presentation and lively paintings, everyone was giving good reviews.

"Setting himself as a primitive avatar and unfolding a new world is unique."

"The primal landscape where one must survive in the wild seems to resemble our society. In the end, only the strong survive here too."

"The rapid strokes, which seem to scratch away, are very sensory. Thanks to that, the obsessive character for survival is well depicted."

Alfonso nodded as he listened to the students.

To see so many unique works... 

It's clear that they have excellent talents this year.

‘Kang Lim and Shin Taemin came from the same school. Oriental students usually have some mental blocks at first, but looking at the two of them, it's not always the case. They are completely open.’

Alfonso smiled at Kang Lim.

He thought that Kang Lim, who was already famous as an excellent artist, must have helped his peers grow together.

The influence of someone who can break norms is powerful.

After a while, once all the students' opinions were shared, Alfonso spoke up.

It was time to wrap up the class.

"You all created various works based on the themes of 'time' and 'freedom.' These two words are abstract and do not exist in any form. Because everyone feels differently, unique works were born. It was really good.

Continue to explore things that cannot be expressed in words, things that are invisible to the eye.

Make people feel the parts of life that they are forgetting. This is why art exists.

I hope you opened your thoughts and hearts wide during this semester. You don't need to come for the remaining classes. Go out and enjoy the exhibition. We'll substitute it with a report."

When Alfonso's lecture ended, the students cheered.

After all, a canceled class is universally good.

‘Even his last words are so professor-like... Everything is OK. It shows that you can include whatever you want.’

Kang Lim smiled as he watched the students excitedly leave the classroom.

It was a good time to experience and express what they saw, heard, and felt.

"Kang Lim-ssi, your work was really great. Thank you for praising my work too. Thanks to the suggestion you gave me to think about, I came up with a good idea."

In the empty classroom, Baudouin approached a bit shyly.

Kang Lim warmly accepted the handshake he offered.

"Ah, thank you. There are only a few weeks left until the end of the semester, so let's do well."

Shin Taemin, who was appreciating the work next to Kang Lim, smirked at Baudouin.

It seemed awkward to greet each other now.

"What are you laughing at from behind?"

Baudouin, feeling embarrassed for having bad-mouthed Kang Lim, grumbled for no reason.

He felt like Shin Taemin had caught onto his weakness.

"No, just. But, hyung, what kind of job did your parents want you to have that you have so much resentment in your work?"

"It's all in the past, so don't worry about it. Why do you have those primitive eyes? Do you have some kind of obsession?"

"I'm not doing it because my parents made me. I originally liked art. It turned out like this because I wanted to do well."

"Why do you keep bringing up your parents? Stop picking a fight. Who asked you?"

They can't seem to communicate… They fight at the drop of a hat. Are roommates always like this?

Kang Lim shook his head as he watched the two.

"Kang Lim-ssi, let's leave Taemin here and go for lunch. By the way, what is that?"

"Ah… It's the floor plan of the Barbara Gallery. I need to order additional clocks when the work is moved to a larger exhibition hall. I also need more wood to make shelves."

"Ah, I see! You should get plenty then."

"Yes, I should. But… lunch might be difficult."

"Why?"

Kang Lim turned on his phone to check the email.

It was a message from his editor-in-charge, Kim Jinseok.

"The Bologna Book Fair opens tomorrow, and I have to attend the award ceremony. I'm taking a train to Italy later today and plan to stay there tonight."

"What? Bologna? Isn't that a children's book contest?"

"Yes, I won the Ragazzi Award."

As Baudouin's eyes widened, Shin Taemin spoke loudly.

He was just as surprised.

"You wrote another children's book? If it's an overseas book fair, you must have already signed a contract?"

"Yes. Are you curious? You like children's books. After I come back, I'll bring you one."

"...You and I are the same age, you know?"

* * *

The next morning, Kang Lim woke up in Bologna.

He took out a clean shirt and opened the window, letting the cool breeze tickle his hair.

The sparkling early summer sunlight and the air were certainly fresh and crisp.

It was thanks to the Apennine Mountains spread out under the sky.

Kang Lim took a breath and looked down at the city.

All the roofs in the town were red, well-matched with the turquoise river flowing through the city.

‘I heard the University of Bologna is the oldest university in the world.’

As befits a city with many historical relics, it was excellently preserved.

Naturally, it reminded him of Florence, the cultural center of the 16th century.

One could call it the cultural capital of Europe.

After finishing his preparations to go out, Kang Lim walked around the city.

It wasn't long before he met Kim Jinseok and the pickup driver.

Seeing the two people he hadn't seen in a while, they greeted each other warmly and headed to the exhibition hall.

"The book fair has been held since 1963. Along with the book fairs in London, Beijing, and Frankfurt, it's called one of the world's four largest book fairs! Of course, it's the largest for children's books!"

"Wow… It's really huge."

Kang Lim looked up at the flags densely hung at the entrance of the exhibition hall.

The flags of the participating countries fluttered in the strong wind.

It was so grand that it reminded him of the opening ceremony of the Olympics.

"Isn't it impressive? What's even more amazing is that you're the star today. Hahaha. I'm really proud! It feels like yesterday when we signed the contract for your first book, and now it's almost been a year."

"Right. It's amazing to me too."

"Follow me. It takes a while to get to the booth. This place is huge. Many people stay for 1-2 days to appreciate it."

"Right… At this scale, there's a lot to learn. I'll be able to see all the illustrations of the year."

As he walked with Kim Jinseok, Kang Lim looked around.

There were many people with lanyards around their necks.

Most of them were illustrators, book designers, and publishing editors.

"I don't see general readers. No children. I thought they might come with their parents."

"Ah, this place is for negotiating publishing licenses. The entry process is strict, and the tickets are expensive, so readers don't usually come. They only come on the last day when they can buy books. The award-winning works are exhibited separately by the organizers, so there's no need to come."

"I see. But aren't the authors already signed with publishers? The publishers are the ones exhibiting."

"Occasionally, individuals participate. And sending it overseas is another matter."

"Ah, I see. They are negotiating exports with foreign buyers."

"Yes! Exactly. We already finished ours."

As they went inside, as Kim Jinseok said, he could hear people trying to persuade each other.

They say a good book gets love calls from everywhere, and the publishers were eager to secure licensing deals.

Many artists were holding their portfolios close.

They hadn't won any awards but wanted to promote their books directly.

They were looking for publishers with discerning eyes to recognize their work.

"Wow. They're really passionate. The exhibition interior is cute, but… the people's state is like a battlefield."

"Haha. Of course! The weight of the award you're receiving is like that. It's the dream of new authors. The children's book market is no joke."

"Indeed. I must work hard."

Kang Lim entered the Korean booth with Kim Jinseok.

The Korean booth was very popular at the fair because it had many excellent illustrators.

In fact, there's a saying to check out the Korean booth first when you come to the Bologna Book Fair.

Kim Jinseok squeezed through the crowded crowd and went under the booth.

He struggled to bring out Kang Lim's translated book.

"Haa. If people knew who Kang Lim-ssi was, there would be a line for autographs, I bet? The Korean booth is already popular, and with a Ragazzi Award winner here…."

Kim Jinseok caught his breath and handed the book to Kang Lim.

Contrary to his tired expression, Kang Lim received the book with an excited face.

As he opened the brand-new book, it made a crisp sound.

"Wow! It looks amazing."

Kang Lim's story and dialogue were written in French.

The fabrics and patches he had carefully selected were attached in colorful patterns.

"It's really well-made! It's even better than I imagined. You can see that it's made with high-quality materials."

The unique texture of the fabric and the dreamy colors were captured exactly as Kang Lim had envisioned.

There was nothing more to add or take away.

"I'm glad you like it."

Kim Jinseok smiled broadly at the happy Kang Lim.

It's different from just handing over the manuscript and receiving the actual book.

Kang Lim was enjoying the happiness that an author could have.

"I want to tear open the CD on the last page and listen to it right away. Thank you so much."

"No problem. We just made it exactly as you created it."

"Is it only translated into French?"

"You live in France, so we signed there first. The English version will be out soon."

"What about the Korean version?"

"That was the first one to come out! We have plenty of copies, so take as many as you want."

Kang Lim put the books he would give to Erlyn in his bag.

He packed generously, considering the books he would give to the residency people and friends.

One shoulder felt heavier, but his heart was light.

"I want to see the books from other countries too. This is really fun."

"Sure. I heard the competition was really fierce this time. Since illustrators from all over the world challenged it, there must have been many excellent works. The judging took several months."

"Wow. I'm looking forward to it."

The booths were grouped by country, but many were also exhibited according to the book's theme.

Kang Lim walked around various stands, appreciating the works.

There were pop-up books where a splendid castle sprang up when opened, fairy tales made in relay by grandmothers who recently learned to read, and even educational books explaining scientific knowledge.

Among them, Kang Lim picked up a book that explained coding in an easy way.

"Wow… Foreign countries are indeed quick with coding education."

"Yes. The country you're in, France, is like that. Finland and the UK have already included it in their regular education."

"Right, I learned computers while I was an exchange student. It seemed difficult, but computer language was fun."

"Exactly. It's important to make it familiar to children in advance."

"This book delivers educational content with fun characters. It was well summarized and clear."

"Haha. That's the grand prize winner in the non-fiction category this time. It's true that an author recognizes another author. Your eyes are really good…."

"Oh, really?"

As they were talking, someone naturally joined the conversation.

"Yes, that's right. The Bologna Award is divided into fiction and non-fiction. Of course, I prefer fiction, where you can imagine freely."

At the unfamiliar voice, Kang Lim turned his head.

Nami Nonoka was offering him a handshake.

"Wow. Hello, author!"

Recognizing her, Kim Jinseok greeted first.

Kang Lim also recognized Nami Nonoka.

He had seen her while researching children's book materials.

‘She's famous as a linguistics professor who won the Carnegie Medal consecutively… She's also a judge for this Bologna fair.’

Kang Lim gently shook hands with Nami Nonoka.

Warmth was conveyed through her hand.

"Kang Lim-ssi! I'm really a fan. Both as a children's author and an artist. You look even more amazing in person. Nice to meet you."

"I'm honored to meet you too. Thank you for recognizing me."

"It’s Italy next to France; how could I not know! I also stayed here for a few months and saw your exhibition."

"Oh, really?"

"Yes. It was an amazing imagination. It gave me chills. That's why you probably write good children's books too!"

Nami Nonoka smiled slightly and pointed to the Korean booth.

"Korean illustrations are very popular these days. Japan too, but there are many good authors in the East."

"Yes. I really like author Sano Yoko's <The Cat That Lived a Million Times>."

"Haha. That's a good one. But I like your <Special Adventure> more."

"Wow! You even know my first work."

"Yes. I read it right away. It was really touching! Please translate it into Japanese too."

Nami Nonoka guided Kang Lim and Kim Jinseok to the award ceremony hall.

She was delighted, saying that the judges were all waiting in the banquet hall.

Recalling the moment when they decided on the grand prize in the final judging, she said,

"We were really surprised when we confirmed the winner. Wow… we wondered if this author was really that author. But your name is unique, so we were sure!"

"Thank you. I will continue to show you good work."

"I read a few articles and heard that you're also participating in the Venice Biennale this time."

Nami Nonoka seemed to be a real fan of Kang Lim.

Talking with her, it turned out she knew all the exhibitions and schedules he had planned so far.

"Yes. Next time I come to Italy, I'll be representing Korea."

"I'm envious. Korea will also make a name in the art world from now on. In fact, the fine arts world is dominated by Europe and America, so it's rare for Eastern countries to win awards."

"Ah, right. Many citizens don't even know about national exhibitions. I don't expect to win either."

Nami Nonoka shook her head as she looked at the calm Kang Lim.

She was very curious about the work he would present, but his nonchalant attitude was slightly annoying.

"There are vested interests both within the country and globally. If you break through the system and work for everyone, I believe you'll win."

Kang Lim nodded quietly at Nami Nonoka.

Her confident gaze gave him positive energy.
