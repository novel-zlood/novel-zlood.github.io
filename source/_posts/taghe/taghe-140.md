## Episode 140: The Unexpected

In front of the main building of the Arsenale at the Venice Biennale.

A blue poster fluttered against the building's exterior wall, embodying the vividness that symbolizes the underwater city of Venice.

A grand parade was taking place in the square.

Street musicians played impromptu music alongside dancing people.

All the villagers ran outside, holding Sangria in one hand, enjoying the leisure of the day.

The festival was as passionate as the scorching sun.

After the opening ceremony, the mayor of Venice stepped onto the podium.

He delivered a welcome speech for the Biennale, the largest event in Italy.

He proudly recounted the history of the world's most prestigious international art exhibition.

Following his address, the Minister of Culture gave a congratulatory speech, and Cecilia, the general director of the Biennale, appeared.

As the award ceremony began, reporters rushed to capture the moment with their cameras.

Who would be the artist to become the protagonist on this glorious day?

An air of solemnity filled the venue.

"...The special award in the national pavilion category goes to Russia!"

The winners were announced one by one.

Kang Lim applauded as he saw the Russian team ascend the podium.

The Russian pavilion was the first exhibition he had visited with Seoyeon.

"Wow, it's the one we said we liked?"

"Yeah, they did well."

Russia had depicted the Chernobyl nuclear explosion through a documentary and installation format.

In the center of the exhibition hall stood a giant figure wearing a gas mask, with a projector inside its eyes.

The documentary screen illuminated the vast exhibition space, tracing events from the explosion to the present.

Visitors watched the video amidst the hazy smoke emerging from the corners of the exhibition hall.

After Russia's acceptance speech, other award-winning works were announced.

Now, only the Golden Lion for the best national pavilion remained.

Hong Aram clenched her hands tightly and closed her eyes.

Ahn Seungjae, the commissioner of the Korean pavilion, and his team began to feel the same tension.

As sweat trickled down their backs, general director Cecilia began to speak.

"In contemporary society, the logic of capitalism has made deep contemplation difficult. However, we humans constantly need self-reflection.

Thus, art highlights the issues of the international community, making people uncomfortable.

The jury and I focused on finding where the truth lies amidst this struggle, as we toured the national pavilions."

Cecilia opened the tightly sealed card and confirmed the winner.

For the first time, the decision was unanimous.

With a faint smile, she announced.

"The Golden Lion for the best national pavilion at the 58th Venice Biennale goes to... Korea!"

At the announcement, Ryu Junhee let out a shout.

Hong Aram's hands trembled with emotion.

Kang Lim hugged his team members, and Seoyeon captured the moment on camera.

Even representatives from other countries stood up and applauded.

As Ahn Seungjae and the Korean pavilion members ascended the podium, the jury's comments were broadcasted.

"The Korean pavilion reflects on the history of its homeland, addressing individuals sacrificed by politics, war, environmental issues, and further, all discrimination and disparities stemming from humanity's selfish nature dividing groups.

The exhibition format includes sculptures, paintings, installations, and participatory art, providing visual delight through various genres of contemporary art.

The exhibition, which traverses a world devoid of love, creates a space for communication, aiming to garner global empathy beyond race and nationality."

Ahn Seungjae received the trophy, and the team members embraced lavish bouquets.

Seoyeon held her camera, undeterred by the reporters' flashing lights.

Ahn Seungjae composed himself before speaking into the microphone.

"The theme of the Korean pavilion is 'Peace for Peace.' This targets the superficial hypocrisy of peace, not peace for love. The peace we maintain now is determined by calculative conditions and can be threatened at any time.

Without the excellent artists, it would have been difficult to create an exhibition that seeks truth amidst the tense atmosphere of the international community. We are truly delighted to receive such a prestigious award..."

Domestic media at the scene reported Ahn Seungjae's acceptance speech in real-time.

The shocking news spread quickly, as the Korean art community, previously considered on the fringes of the Giardini, made a triumphant impact.

Keywords like Kang Lim, Biennale, and Golden Lion swiftly filled the real-time search rankings on portal sites.

[Korea Wins Art Olympics!]

[Korean Pavilion Wins Golden Lion at Venice Biennale]

[Korean Pavilion's Message to the World]

Seoyeon checked the comments as she clicked through various articles.

The scroll moved quickly.

- Wow, Korea winning the Golden Lion at the Biennale... I can't believe I lived to see this.

└ So, there's an Olympics for art too, huh?

└ It's like winning the top prize at the Academy Awards. This is unbelievable lol.

└ We've won many international awards in music and sports, but this is the first for art ㄷㄷ.

└ Truly a powerhouse in arts and sports ㅎㅎ.

- Is this thanks to Kang Lim? There was a lot of buzz in the foreign media even before the preview exhibition.

└ This work is amazing. Check out my blog post for more details.

└ Ryu Junhee's work has also improved a lot. She painted endangered flora and fauna in the DMZ, and it's really dreamy.

└ Her art style seems to have evolved from interacting with great artists? Still, she draws a lot of flowers.

└ Talented genius artists ㅠㅠ Truly proud.

"Congratulations! Domestic fans are thrilled too!"

Seoyeon beamed as she looked at the team members coming down from the podium.

Ahn Seungjae held the hefty Golden Lion trophy, and Hong Aram wept tears of joy.

Having dedicated her life to exhibition planning, it was natural for her to be overwhelmed with emotion.

After a brief commemorative photo session, the main exhibition awards continued.

As the main exhibition organized by the Biennale was separate from the national pavilion, Kang Lim watched the awards ceremony with ease.

"The Silver Lion for the 58th Venice Biennale goes to...”

The Silver Lion was awarded exclusively to artists under 35.

Implicitly, it was the highest award a newcomer could receive.

Kang Lim thought of the artists who had showcased their individual works in the main exhibition.

He had a mental shortlist of potential winners.

But then...

"It's Kang Lim!"

His own name was announced.

* * *

A few days later, in Seoul.

Not only online articles but also various newspaper front pages featured Kang Lim's image.

Foreign media focused on the news of the youngest ever Silver Lion winner at the Biennale.

Kang Lim's fashion also drew significant attention, as he had declared his role as the official muse for Alexander McQueen that day.

"Honey, look at this! It's a sensation."

"I'm looking at it! What in the world..."

Kang Lim's parents checked the newspaper they received on the subway after work.

Their son's dapper appearance in a summer suit seemed unfamiliar.

One side of the jacket was made of light cotton, while the other side was shiny satin.

The shirt had a pleated skirt-like long length, giving a unique feel as it protruded from the jacket.

It was a garment with a geometric pattern intertwined with different materials.

"Oh my, he's getting better at dressing. What's going on?"

"They say he's become a muse for the luxury fashion brand Alexander McQueen. I guess they provide him with clothes."

As the couple gathered information, the anchor's voice came from the TV.

The news was also about the Venice Biennale.

"Korea has won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale, a prestigious festival known as the Olympics of the art world. Young artist Kang Lim also won the Silver Lion, achieving a double victory. Here's the detailed report."

The screen showed Kang Lim amid a flurry of camera flashes.

Reporters demanded explanations about his work.

Particularly, they pressed him for answers to the final question.

Questions about personal religious views or political issues in the international community were also raised.

These were sensitive matters that couldn't be answered lightly.

The host from the organizing committee scolded the gathered reporters to maintain silence.

At first, Kang Lim seemed taken aback as if he hadn't anticipated winning, but he gradually became composed.

Seeing the chaotic crowd, he became even calmer.

He spoke in a clear voice.

"There is no definitive answer in art. My opinion is just one person's thought. I depicted a world where even love can become false, and I hope the audience finds various meanings within it.

I agree with Adorno's statement that 'art should ultimately liberate from all kinds of oppression by reproducing and criticizing society,' and I hope that the public consciousness buried under power structures does not end in silence. Whatever it may be."

Im Yujin nodded as she read the translated acceptance speech.

She didn't know when he had matured so much.

There were times when she saw him as just a young boy, but that was a mistaken thought.

The TV screen switched to the SBC newsroom, featuring Ahn Seungjae, the commissioner responsible for the Korean pavilion.

He was invited for an interview after returning to the country to provide vivid insights.

Ahn Seungjae detailed the exhibition layout and the artists' works.

The anchor was amazed by the coherent flow derived from a consistent theme.

The direction and display needed for exhibition planning were intriguing.

"The final circular exhibition hall featuring Kang Lim's work was a masterstroke! It encompassed all issues!"

"Yes. The circular exhibition hall had a large area, so we were struggling to fill it when one artist dropped out. Kang Lim resolved this for us. And in a genre we've never seen before."

"It's an interactive work combining sculpture, painting, and storytelling. Kang Lim is also famous as a fairy tale writer, which must be related, right?"

"That's correct. Kang Lim's unique world resembles literature full of imagination."

The anchor displayed an image of Kang Lim holding the Silver Lion on the screen.

It was a highly unusual event.

"Not only is he the youngest ever to win the Silver Lion, but it's also the first time it's been awarded to an artist from a national pavilion."

"Yes. This was unexpected for us as well."

Ahn Seungjae explained the operating principles of the Venice Biennale.

He described the differences between the main exhibition located at the Arsenale and the national pavilions at the Giardini.

"The main exhibition is where the organizers directly invite artists. Last year, artists from 50 countries were selected. Mainly, artists who have held exhibitions in national pavilions or already have worldwide fame are invited. Just participating is an honor."

"The Silver Lion was originally awarded to an individual artist in the main exhibition."

"Yes. Awarding the Silver Lion to Kang Lim, who participated in the national pavilion group exhibition, signifies high recognition of his artistic value. He's made a definite mark on the global stage."

The anchor displayed past Korean artists who participated in the main exhibition.

Prominent figures like Nam June Paik and Go Haeyoung appeared.

"What if Kang Lim participates in the main exhibition? Could he become the first Korean to win the individual Golden Lion?"

The anchor's question made Ahn Seungjae smile.

His eyes reflected a certain degree of confidence.

"The main exhibition is much larger in scale than the Korean pavilion. It's an opportunity to showcase an individual's free creative capabilities. If Kang Lim is invited to the Venice Biennale in two years, we might see his new masterpiece. I'm really looking forward to it."

Such remarks could burden a new artist who had just finished a major event.

Normally, Ahn Seungjae would never make such statements, but he couldn't help but express his expectations.

It was thanks to the last sight of Kang Lim before leaving the country.

He had never seen such a bold young man.

* * *

A few days ago, the Korean pavilion team enjoyed a meal with Ahn Seungjae.

It was a farewell party before returning home.

Enjoying the aftermath of the Venice Biennale, which would run for five months, was also nice.

"We're staying here. You go ahead."

"Sorry we can't return home gloriously together."

Ryu Junhee and Hong Aram decided to stay in Italy.

They were curious about Kang Lim's work ahead of his solo exhibition.

"Barbara Gallery is going to exhibit Kang Lim's work at Art Basel in Switzerland!"

"There are many notable exhibitions in Europe during the summer. We can't miss them!"

Unlike the excited two, Ahn Seungjae looked worried.

Even without creating works, it was exhausting, and now he had to hold a solo exhibition here...

He couldn't even imagine Kang Lim's state.

"Artists really have an extreme job. Will Kang Lim be okay? He must be tired with back-to-back big events..."

Understandably so, considering the Venice Biennale, Art Basel in Switzerland, and Documenta in Kassel, Germany.

He was the first 20-year-old artist to participate in two of the three major international art exhibitions consecutively.

'Just as celebrities experience post-concert depression, artists might face a slump after a major exhibition...'

As if reading Ahn Seungjae's mind, Ryu Junhee burst into laughter.

"Haha. I know what you're thinking. Don't worry, we're here!"

Ryu Junhee placed a hand on Kang Lim's shoulder, and Seoyeon also stuck close to him.

Warmth was transmitted through Kang Lim's right hand.

"That's right. He has many friends. The people helping with this solo exhibition are already waiting in Germany."

Ahn Seungjae smiled at Kang Lim.

Knowing he had many colleagues was somewhat reassuring.

"Still, if you're worried, can you help with one thing?"

"Sure. I'll do anything."

Kang Lim handed a letter to Ahn Seungjae, who was about to leave.

"What's this?"

"It's a message to the mayor of Venice. Please deliver it."

"..."

The firm voice and resolute eyes made Ahn Seungjae flinch.

This wasn't like Nam June Paik writing to the mayor of Venice.

"If I send it through the address, it might get delayed."

"May I check the contents?"

"Of course."

Ahn Seungjae opened the envelope and took out the letter.

Summarized in elegant italics, the content was simple.

[Please lend me the sea of Venice for just one day.]
