## Episode 99: Angel

A clear sky without a single cloud.

Kang Lim left his accommodation and walked to the subway station.

In front of famous landmarks like the Louvre, Notre Dame, and the Eiffel Tower, there were always tourist buses parked, but the area around his accommodation was quiet.

Maybe it was because it was a late morning. There weren't many people in the subway either.

'Wow. It's been a really long time.'

Kang Lim fiddled with the subway ticket he had purchased.

In Korea, he was used to tapping a card, so this felt like a foreign object to him.

"Even that feels new."

"Haha... yes."

The one who had asked the question next to him was none other than Shin Hansoo.

Kang Lim looked at him with a polite smile.

Although he wanted to say that the professor felt unfamiliar, he held back.

The professor claimed it was educational to walk around, but he stayed quietly by his side like a No-Face, leaving Kang Lim with nothing to say.

'Well, he did come to Paris because of me, so he might feel bored... But surely he won't keep following me around like this, right?'

As he was thinking that, a train came into the long tunnel.

There were no screen doors, and without a display board showing the train's arrival, a cold wind blew fiercely.

The train felt just as chilly. Even though it had stopped, the door didn't open.

'What's this? Is it just passing by? Or is it broken?'

As Kang Lim looked flustered, Shin Hansoo spoke.

"It's manual. You have to open it by hand."

Shin Hansoo grabbed the handle and pushed the door to the side.

"Wow... I didn't know because I've been taking buses all this time."

As they stepped inside, they saw people of various ethnicities who looked like locals.

Most people were either looking at their phones, reading books, or newspapers.

Kang Lim was the only one looking around like a tourist.

'It's probably not good to stare too much.'

Kang Lim closed his eyes and listened to the faint voices of people on their phones.

He heard accents mixed with Arabic or Vietnamese. It didn't quite sound like native French.

'They say there are many immigrants from West Africa, but it doesn't seem like that. The accents are incredibly diverse...'

The voices of the people spread out rhythmically like colors on a palette.

Kang Lim enjoyed following that rhythm.

Because this was also a unique experience he could only feel here.

Shin Hansoo observed Kang Lim from the side.

It was his job to closely observe the attitude of artists to write critiques.

He was particularly curious about the process of an artist like Kang Lim who did such interesting work.

Shin Hansoo spoke in a low voice.

"A landscape with various elements mixed... It looks like the piece you showed this time. Are you going to add more to it in Paris, like those who write 'étranger'?"

What is this person? Is he analyzing my thoughts?

Kang Lim opened his eyes at the sudden Korean.

"Yes, that's right. How did you know?"

"I just had a feeling."

"But the word 'étranger' is funny. It's strange that the French language spoken by foreigners isn't called French but étranger..."

"They have pride in their language, and Quebec French is quite different. Also, étranger means foreigner."

"Well, that's true. But I like étranger. It's fun to hear the mix of various voices. Just because it's dissonant doesn't mean it's not beautiful."

"I like what you just said."

Shin Hansoo scribbled a few words in his notebook.

Seeing him jot down his words, Kang Lim felt a bit eerie.

Is this what it takes to be a critic? Seoyeon should learn from this.

Various thoughts crossed his mind, but on the other hand, he felt a bit sorry for Shintaemin.

The place they arrived at was not Montmartre Hill, but a flea market at the foot of the hill.

Although the Saint-Honoré Street filled with luxury jewelry boutiques and high-fashion shops was impressive, Kang Lim wanted to feel the local atmosphere.

Items that could only be purchased at traditional markets... things that people actually used in their daily lives were abundant.

Of course, to Kang Lim, they all looked like materials.

"Wow... this is a treasure trove. It's no joke."

Kang Lim's eyes sparkled as he looked at the lined-up antiques.

Accessories, tableware, shoes, paintings, clothes, and more... It was a place that had gathered all sorts of items, big and small.

The vendors were dressed neatly, proudly showing off their products to passersby.

The lively street excited him.

Kang Lim first went to a store displaying second-hand dolls.

Pointing at a cute alpaca doll with black eyes and a round, curled-up mouth, he asked.

"How much is this?"

"1 euro."

"Wow. That's cheap. Are all the dolls here 1 euro?"

"Yes, except for the big ones."

At the affordable price, Kang Lim picked several animal dolls.

An alpaca, a sheep, a llama, a wolf, a badger, and even a doll with braided hair...

The vendor seemed puzzled as to why a young man was buying such dolls.

Shin Hansoo also tilted his head in confusion.

What on earth does he plan to do with those things? He quickly followed Kang Lim down the alley.

Kang Lim was so absorbed in his shopping spree that he seemed like he might get buried in the store at any moment.

He bought old coins, rough wooden floorboards, fake crocodile skin bags, belts, and shoes... Items with no commonality at all.

'Is he planning to create an installation work using second-hand items used by the masses?'

As he was enthusiastically shopping, Kang Lim suddenly stopped.

It was in front of a large shop that reminded him of a fabric store.

There were many clothes, but what caught his eye in particular were the fabrics and decorations for gypsy costumes piled up in a corner.

Kang Lim admired the unique and beautiful patterns. They looked like something a wizard would use for casting spells.

He immediately picked out the colors he wanted and asked the owner.

"How much for this?"

"We don't price them individually. It's 2 euros per kilogram."

The shop owner pointed to a scale in front of the store.

He meant that the old clothes would be sold by weight.

"Oh, really? Just a moment."

Kang Lim picked various fabrics of different thicknesses. He also touched the textures and chose a good mix.

He didn't forget to buy cotton for stuffing, buttons, and zippers to connect the fabrics.

They were rustic but stylish items.

Watching Kang Lim, Shin Hansoo finally couldn't hold back his curiosity and spoke.

"What kind of work are you planning to do with all this?"

Kang Lim laughed and said.

"I'm going to make a fairy tale book. The protagonist has a keen interest in fashion, so there's a lot to buy."

A fairy tale book! So I came along just to see him do that.

Shin Hansoo let out a sigh of frustration at the unexpected answer.

"Ha... Did you really come all the way here just to make a fairy tale book?"

"Just a fairy tale book? I'm going to submit it to the upcoming International Book Fair. Fairy tale illustrations are art too."

"...It's a futile task."

"Why is it futile? Children will like my book more than the ones you write, Professor. Haha."

Kang Lim also bought a bracelet with an angel charm for the vendor and put it on Shin Hansoo's wrist.

"Try to open your mind a bit more."

"......"

* * *

Leaving all the materials he had purchased at the accommodation, Kang Lim went out again.

Passing through Rue de l'Essonne, he came to a large intersection where there was a restaurant called 'Mild Winter.'

It was a popular place where Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir discussed philosophy, and literary figures like Rimbaud and Hemingway interacted.

In the past, it even received high ratings from gourmets, so Kang Lim was curious about the restaurant.

"Thanks to you, Professor, I get to try something good. People are always lining up, and I've been wanting to come here. Thank you."

"Experiencing unfamiliar sensations is important. That includes taste. The best cuisine has that much value."

"If we're talking about unfamiliar things... the flea market was quite shocking for you, wasn't it?"

"...Yes. But it's most important for an artist to meet the highest-level artists. You need to interact with high-level people in any field."

Shin Hansoo scratched his wrist where the angel bracelet was, and his skin was already turning red as they went inside.

"Wow... it's beautiful."

Kang Lim looked around the interior as he sat down.

White tables and colorful chairs caught his eye.

With such a unique interior, the food was likely to be beautifully decorated as well.

Shin Hansoo ordered a course meal and drank water from a transparent wine glass as he spoke.

"I heard you'll be working under a pseudonym for the time being."

"Yes, that's right."

"I think it's a good choice. The art world here isn't very open to foreigners."

"I'm not sure yet, but secrets do make people curious."

"Yes. Anyway, I hope you build a good career here and have an exhibition in Germany. The audience there really loves artists. Many people come to see the exhibitions."

"Well, I've heard Berlin is popular these days."

"Exactly. If you get recognized in Europe, you'll gain a refined image. People often find it more thoughtful and philosophical than achieving success directly in the U.S."

"Haha. That's funny. Maybe it's because the image of pop art is so strongly ingrained in the U.S."

While they were chatting, a waiter came in and handed them an aperitif.

It was a drink served before the appetizer to stimulate the appetite.

The orange-colored drink was in a glass smaller than a wine glass.

Kang Lim watched as Shin Hansoo took a sip of the drink.

As he was about to follow suit, Shin Hansoo made a face and stopped him.

"Why? Does it taste bad?"

"It seems like a mistake. An aperitif shouldn't be this bitter."

Out of curiosity, Kang Lim took a sip of the drink.

The taste burned his throat, causing him to grimace involuntarily.

"Ugh. This is too strong."

"They prepare a digestif to aid digestion after a meal, usually using strong cognac. It seems they mistook it for an aperitif."

"Wow. This is too strong to drink on an empty stomach."

Kang Lim grimaced as he swallowed some water.

This level of alcohol was something only a Russian could handle.

Shin Hansoo felt a bit angry that he had brought Kang Lim here only to be treated this way.

France, the country that established the course meal order, making such a mistake was unbelievable to him.

Maybe they were too busy because it was crowded...

He calmed himself and said.

"I heard you're going to put a piece up for auction at Christie's. I'm curious about that work."

"Oh! It's an oriental piece. It's a new technique I developed while preparing for a competition, and I'm planning to apply it."

"Is it like the ink wash painting you put up for auction in Korea? I'm sorry, but such works are shunned here. Traditional art is not mainstream. Western culture can't fully appreciate its value. It might be different if you become a world-renowned artist."

"No, no! It's a colored painting. I'll show it to you when it's finished."

"Alright. That sounds good."

Once again, the waiter came in and served the appetizers.

It was pan-seared scallops and snails.

Kang Lim licked his lips at the sight of the golden brown food.

"Oh. It's beautiful. The decorating."

"Hmm..."

Shin Hansoo slightly furrowed his eyebrows again.

The warm appetizer should have been served before the main course, but it was already out, which was strange.

Noticing that Shin Hansoo's expression wasn't good, Kang Lim asked.

"Why? Don't you like the food?"

"Usually, they serve a cold appetizer first. Something light like a salmon salad."

"Hmm... Let me try it first."

Kang Lim had a feeling something was off.

He took a bite of the snail with his knife.

Sure enough, it was extremely salty. Way too salty for human consumption.

He had heard of wasabi attacks in Japan, but this was the first time experiencing a salt attack.

"Professor, I don't think the food is going to be normal from now on."

As soon as he finished speaking, the waiter kept bringing out more dishes.

Clear consommé, grilled lamb ragoût, chicken fricassee in cream sauce, seasoned lobster thermidor, melted chocolate and cheeses...

The waiter seemed unconcerned about the order and layout of the dishes, spreading them all out on the table.

Shin Hansoo spoke with a bewildered expression.

"We ordered a course meal. It's uncomfortable to have everything spread out like this."

The waiter frowned and said.

"Our restaurant is usually very busy, so even with a course meal, we serve everything at once."

Lies. French dining culture is known for its long meal times.

They value tasting the food and conversing with others.

Most places, even if rushed, follow the appetizer-main-dessert course order, especially in a famous restaurant like this... There was only one explanation.

"The food tastes strange too."

"Are you insulting the chef?"

"Ha."

Kang Lim looked around.

There were no other tables with as much food spread out as theirs.

It felt like blatant discrimination.

But there wasn't much they could do. He had only heard about such situations but never imagined experiencing it firsthand.

What good was it if philosophers had discussions here? The descendants are like this...

Kang Lim spoke in a calm voice.

If he lost his temper here, it would only embarrass the professor who had invited him.

"Professor, it's okay. You said experiencing unfamiliar situations was important. This is also good material."

"...I don't understand what you're trying to say."

"Drawing this experience would be nice too. I was wondering what to draw for the auction, but now I have my answer. Thanks to you, Professor."

Kang Lim smiled brightly at Shin Hansoo.

Shin Hansoo was a bit taken aback, but seeing his bright smile, his unpleasant feelings slowly subsided.

Unconsciously, one corner of his mouth lifted as well.

What is he thinking?

Kang Lim was unpredictable.
