## Episode 124: The End of the Story

Seoyeon entered Degas' studio with Kang Lim.

As her shiny enamel shoes touched the wooden floor, they made a creaking sound.

The set was so delicately built that it almost startled her.

"Wow... Even an old room like this can be recreated."

Kang Lim quietly smiled and followed Seoyeon.

Inside the atelier, there were oil-stained water containers and art supplies that hadn't been cleaned for a long time.

Dust had settled by the windows, and in the middle of the studio stood a young ballerina.

The bronze sculpture shone brightly among the cracked clay and wax.

The ballerina had her arms clasped behind her back, eyes closed.

Bright light fell on her outstretched neck and thick eyelids.

As the wind came through the window, the skirt made of nylon fabric fluttered.

"...This is actually finished with bronze, right? Degas worked like this, attaching ballet costumes directly to the sculpture."

Kang Lim nodded at Seoyeon's words.

"That's right. Isn't it cool? The art team helped a lot, so it didn't take long to make."

"Of course, you're good at three-dimensional modeling too. It looks just like the one at the Orsay. It's so atmospheric."

Seoyeon appreciated the piece, recalling the final scenario of the film.

Feelings of sadness and empathy for the characters naturally arose.

"...Lim, what if the protagonist Christian had told the countess the truth from the beginning? If he had said that he had the same face as her son, she would have felt less betrayed."

"Well, he hid it because he loved her too much and didn't want to be abandoned. It would be too shocking to have the same face as her son. It's not like the Oedipus myth; no one would like that."

"But he wasn't actually her son."

"True..."

Christian gathered artists to create a residency.

He persuaded many American art investors to support them and hold successful exhibitions.

He used all the future knowledge he had to constantly stimulate the painters.

Their desire to succeed quickly brought their prime time forward.

However, focusing on pretending to be the count's son, Christian missed one crucial fact.

He didn't realize that there was a division among the painters he was nurturing.

The young Van Gogh, whom he had persuaded to bring in early, couldn't get along with others.

This was because Van Gogh's painting skills were significantly inferior to other painters.

Sisley, Renoir, Monet, and others...

Not all the painters distorted forms because they lacked drawing skills.

They were also formally trained at the atelier.

Especially Degas, who had entered the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts at the top of his class but quit because he found nothing to learn there, despised Van Gogh even more.

It's not that drawing well is the most important thing, but young Van Gogh was still a painter without his own individuality.

Because he started painting too early due to the protagonist, Van Gogh continuously faced disdain and began to show a peculiar personality that couldn't accept others' critiques.

Eventually, Van Gogh became a drunkard who mingled with prostitutes, just like in his original life.

Degas hated Van Gogh, who had all the conditions he disliked.

He continued to exclude Van Gogh, and the other painters tacitly accepted this.

Painters like Monet, who had a sickly wife and children, wanted a successful exhibition because they had families to support.

What they all wanted was for Van Gogh, who hadn't yet become a painter, not to participate in the exhibition.

'Everyone has their circumstances. Everyone moves according to their desires. The protagonist's dream of letting the respected Van Gogh paint freely fades away...'

As Kang Lim thought, Christian couldn't understand the increasingly twisted Van Gogh.

One day, when he caught Van Gogh trying to set fire to the atelier, he got angry and kicked him out.

He cursed, saying, "I supported you, so why did it come to this? You were born like this."

A few years later, on the day the exhibition ended successfully,

Christian heard the news that Van Gogh had committed suicide.

Where Van Gogh had stayed was filled with works that Christian loved.

Sunflowers as radiant as the sun, burning trees... Pure yellow wheat fields wriggled.

They were paintings Van Gogh had fiercely painted, driven by a desire for recognition.

Christian shed tears as he looked at the frenzied touch of the paintings.

Realizing the truth among the painters, he understood that it was he who had twisted that time.

Van Gogh died much earlier and lonelier than in his original life.

Because he brought him in before he could form any bonds with other painters.

Christian, who wanted to support the painters and make them happy,

Ran to the countess with guilt and regret.

He wanted to leave immediately, saying he no longer wanted to be involved with paintings and exhibitions.

However, the countess was already cold.

She had also known the truth for a long time.

"Still, when Christian cries out in agony, saying 'You are my son,' that line is too cruel. With a face telling him to disappear immediately..."

At Seoyeon's words, Kang Lim responded.

"Well, it's ultimately a tragedy. He couldn't keep his love or his dream... In the end, he tries to burn all the paintings he collected, just like Van Gogh did to him."

"But that fails too... Christian, who tries to set a fire, gets caught by the count and is dragged out, and the film ends with an old Degas' flashback scene?"

Seoyeon had a slightly discontented expression about the ending.

Seeing her a bit aggrieved, Kang Lim smirked.

She hadn't even seen the movie yet, but her empathy was quite strong.

"It's a sad ending."

"Yeah... I wonder how the last scene was directed... The scene where Christian’s whereabouts are unknown."

"Who knows?"

The movie ends with a flashback scene of an aged Degas.

Degas, nearly blind due to poor eyesight, starts sculpting because he can no longer paint.

Thus, the studio set is filled with clay and wax.

In the movie, Degas is depicted as being punished for persistently tormenting Van Gogh, as if he went blind as retribution.

Monet, who suffered from cataracts due to constant exposure to sunlight outdoors, is also depicted similarly.

It feels like they are being punished for failing to embrace someone.

They talk, reminiscing about Christian.

From the first moment they saw the radiant young man to the rumors of him being mad.

It's unclear whether the mad person was the count's mentally disabled son or Christian.

The audience is left not knowing whether the protagonist was killed for betraying the count.

The open ending is conveyed only through the words of the two painters.

Recalling the scenario, Kang Lim spoke.

"Director Frazer would probably end it similarly to the first scene. With a cyclical structure."

"How?"

"The protagonist Christian's previous studio is similar to Degas' studio. Both were sculptors, so the materials they used were similar."

"Oh, right."

"The symbolism of being abandoned by his mother also makes them similar characters... He would shoot it in the same composition. The camera movement would be the same. But the final scene will have much lonelier lighting."

"Lonelier lighting?"

"This movie talks about individual fate and choices. The painters ultimately live lives similar to the ones they lived."

Seoyeon nodded as she listened to Kang Lim.

At first, it seemed like the painters' lives changed significantly due to Christian's intervention, but the fundamental outcome was the same as their original lives.

"It details the backgrounds of the characters. The protagonist's narrative is the same... The characters here each have their circumstances, leading them to make regrettable choices. You can't distinguish whether fate or choice comes first."

"...That's a bit complex. Do you mean personal choices are determined by social environments?"

"Something like that. Van Gogh's peculiar personality also comes from the lack of love he experienced in childhood. Especially since his father raised him strictly."

"Right. He was obsessively educated to become a righteous clergyman in place of his dead older brother."

"Yeah. So, ultimately, a character's choices reflect the life they've lived. The movie talks about the unfortunate choices of various characters."

Kang Lim spoke slowly as he walked towards the window.

If the camera moved, it would approach slowly like this.

"Fate can be influenced by choices, and choices can be influenced by fate."

"That makes sense..."

"There are many things in the world that can't be helped. The director would express this situation ambiguously. So, in the end, he won't show the character clearly and will capture only the silhouette. Filming against the sunset with backlighting. The dialogue scene between the two will transition with a dissolve cut."

Seoyeon envisioned the scene Kang Lim described.

A scene where the front shot and the back shot gradually change, depicting the passage of time in an emotional atmosphere.

She thought it would be an amazing scene if shown with great movie music.

Just then, breaking the silence, applause was heard.

When she turned around, Charlotte stood there, looking touched.

"Correct! You nailed how Director Frazer shot it. You really read his mind? Even I don't understand my husband sometimes... You're really impressive."

"Oh, you're here?"

Kang Lim greeted with a slightly flustered expression.

He regretted rambling on.

But Charlotte knowing French was even more impressive.

"Hello! The set is amazing."

Seoyeon greeted Charlotte.

Charlotte smiled at the polite two.

"Thank you for the compliment."

"No, I was really surprised by how detailed it is."

"Haha. Then I'll give a gift to both of you who guessed the movie's ending!"

"Huh?"

* * *

A gift? Kang Lim and Seoyeon followed Charlotte with bewildered expressions.

They arrived at a set with a special camera.

"Wow! Isn't this a Daguerreotype camera? Where did you get this?"

Kang Lim ran up to the small wooden box.

A single lens protruded like a mini cannon.

Charlotte shrugged and said.

"It came up at an antique auction. I bought it for a billion. The scene where Christian takes a family photo is significant."

"Oh. It's really cool. Does it work?"

"Of course. I'll take a picture of you two now. It's a rare experience."

"We'd appreciate it."

Seoyeon's eyes sparkled as she looked at Charlotte.

She was as surprised as Kang Lim.

"Wow... But how do you develop it?"

"You fix the lens cap on a silver plate and develop it with mercury vapor. It takes a bit of time, but I'll give it to you as a gift."

"Wow... Thank you."

"Then pose for me! Over there."

Seoyeon and Kang Lim stood where Charlotte pointed.

Standing in front of the unique camera, they felt a strange sensation.

Charlotte looked at the two standing far apart and said.

"Get closer. You don't look close."

Seoyeon slowly moved next to Kang Lim.

She felt like a crab. Kang Lim found Seoyeon's sudden shyness amusing.

"What! Why are you laughing?"

"Nothing, just get closer."

Taking the opportunity, Kang Lim grabbed Seoyeon's shoulder and pulled her closer.

Seoyeon's eyes widened in surprise.

Kang Lim didn't turn his head, but he felt everything.

Her blushing cheeks, the hands that momentarily clenched and released.

"This is a new Daguerreotype, so it takes just one minute! I'll count 60 seconds. Try not to blink."

"Okay..."

Kang Lim smiled as he heard Seoyeon's small voice.

'Old Daguerreotypes required standing still for 20 minutes to form an image... that's a shame.'

In old black-and-white photos, people always looked expressionless.

Standing with a smiling face for 20 minutes would cause muscle spasms.

The new Daguerreotype was revolutionary.

Since then, painters' works have also changed. With realistic photos becoming widespread, Impressionism emerged as art reflecting the times.

Unique compositions, like those in snap photos, were influenced by camera technology.

'Just as tube paints became popular, allowing outdoor painting. Various factors aligned to create unique art styles. Art always reflects the era we live in...'

While Kang Lim pondered, Charlotte shouted.

"Alright, let's begin! 60 seconds!"

Kang Lim stared at the lens.

Focused, he gripped his hands tightly.

Seoyeon, feeling the closing distance, was tense.

"59!"

"58!"

"57!"

"56!"

.

.

.

One minute felt so long.

Seoyeon was acutely aware of her racing heartbeat.

It felt like something was swelling inside her chest.

She wanted to cover her face or lips with her hands, but she had to hold her position.

"30!"

"29!"

"28!"

.

.

.

Kang Lim also felt the presence beside him while looking forward.

The soft movements, the lovely breathing.

He felt warmth from the close intimacy.

.

.

.

"3!"

"2!"

"1!"

"It's done!"

As soon as the shooting ended, Kang Lim met Seoyeon's eyes.

He swallowed unconsciously and spoke.

"Let's create works that can only be made in our time. Something so amazing that future generations will see it as a record."

Seoyeon pouted at the sudden comment.

She turned away, but a smile lingered on her lips.

"What are you talking about... Always about art."

* * *

The next day, Kang Lim visited the meeting room at Heyum Art Museum as promised.

He sat calmly, sipping the tea Ryu Miyeon had prepared.

In front of him was Franz Weber, the director of the Barbara Gallery.

Franz was a striking figure with a bald head revealing his scalp.

It was shaved so closely... His elongated face and sharp nose stood out.

'He really is a man of distinct features.'

Through his lightly worn glasses, he looked at Kang Lim.

His head was round, but his gaze was quite sharp.

"I was deeply moved by Kang Lim's profound contemplation and artistic perspective. Truly remarkable."

"Thank you. I also saw the exhibition you curated. It was impressive just from the photos."

Franz raised his eyebrows slightly at Kang Lim's German.

"Wow. You speak German very well."

"As you know, I have a good memory, so I learned languages quickly."

"Haha. Fascinating."

Franz laughed heartily. When wrinkles formed around his eyes, his cold impression softened.

Kang Lim also smiled back at him.

'He's really an important guest. Franz has extensive connections in the art world. Exhibiting at the Barbara Gallery will open up many opportunities.'

Just as musicians dream of performing with a world-class orchestra or at Carnegie Hall, artists are the same.

Artists dream of exhibiting at places like the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York or the Tate Modern in London.

These are the centers of the art world, where they can meet the most visitors.

Of course, to exhibit at famous museums requires extensive experience.

One crucial career milestone is exhibiting at key galleries in various countries.

The Barbara Gallery, located in Berlin, Germany, was an influential gallery and a great opportunity.

It was as large as a national museum.

"This exhibition will also be submitted to the Sweet Art Basel. Although it's a world-scale art fair, we expect that Kang Lim might win the Baloise Art Prize."

Franz sent a trusting gaze.

'Ah. That's a bit of pressure... Awards are subjective after all.'

Kang Lim sighed lightly but already held the file Franz handed him.

"This is the content of our exhibition. There are no restrictions on work conditions, so please match the theme and do as you wish. You may be busy with student work, but your coursework will be as excellent as your main work. You're a professional."

Kang Lim meticulously reviewed Franz's exhibition plan.

Just as the German art scene favored, the content was philosophical and challenging to prepare quickly.
