## Episode 56: Into the Wider World

Gerald finished his class and rushed into Go Haeyoung's lab.

It was time for dinner, but this portfolio was much more important.

He couldn't wait to show Go Haeyoung the portfolio filled with hundreds of drawings submitted by Kang Lim.

During class, he found Kang Lim's calm demeanor somewhat annoying and tried to hide his surprise...

But this was beyond his imagination.

"Haeyoung! This is huge!"

Gerald's booming voice echoed.

Seeing Gerald burst through the door, Go Haeyoung raised an eyebrow.

She was just about to leave, so she looked slightly annoyed.

As she put on the jacket that was draped over her chair, she said,

"Are you here because of Junhee? I know he just came back to Korea. I also know he's hosting a seminar with his juniors next week."

Gerald shouted in response to Go Haeyoung's incorrect guess.

"No, that's not it! Junhee isn't the problem right now!"

"Then what is?"

"I told the students to bring the drawings they've done so far to class, right?"

"And?"

"But Ga... Kang Lim submitted a portfolio with 200 pieces! And he has ten times more at home! Isn't that insane?"

"...What?"

Go Haeyoung looked as if to ask if it was true.

Seeing her disbelief, Gerald shouted even louder.

"I'm telling you! I didn't believe it at first either! Honestly, I thought there would be a few hundred pieces at most, but not this many! And it's not just the quantity, you have to see the quality. Look at this right now!"

Gerald shoved four thick binders into Go Haeyoung's chest.

Caught off guard, she took the binders and sat back down in her chair.

As she cautiously turned the cover, her hands began to tremble.

* * *

As Go Haeyoung turned the pages for a long time, her eyes sank into darkness.

She couldn't help but nod slowly at the endless depth of the drawings.

Her usually erect posture began to falter.

Gerald, impatient with her slow perusal, bustled around noisily.

He was always talkative, but today he was even more so, and his eyebrows remained raised in excitement.

Finally, unable to bear it any longer, Gerald shouted.

"Ah! You've seen enough, right? Why are you so slow!"

"Yes, it's really surprising. There are many pieces better than the ones you bought..."

Gerald nodded vigorously with a bright smile.

"Right? Let's get him exempted from military service first."

"That's nonsense."

Seeing that Go Haeyoung didn't catch on quickly, Gerald shook his head.

"Our country is great, but it's sad that young men have to serve in the military at their prime... If he could hold an exhibition in a famous overseas art museum at such a young age, he'd bring great honor to the country... It's such a waste!"

"It's strange to hear you say 'our country.'"

Gerald's Korean was excessively patched.

"I've lived here too long!"

"Hmm..."

"Anyway! If he wins the grand prize at the Korean Art Contest, he'll be exempt from military service. I'll tell Kang Lim to enter as soon as the announcement is made. You should recommend him for next year's Biennale. He needs to be known to many people; he needs to go out into the wider world."

"...The Biennale is held every two years. Next year's participants are already decided; the earliest he could be recommended for is the one three years from now."

"Damn it!"

"And I believe the military exemption for the Korean Art Contest is only valid until this year; they're planning to abolish it next year."

"Why?"

"Because of too much corruption, obviously."

In fields like music, dance, sports, and art, those who demonstrate clear talent are given exemptions according to the Military Service Act.

For example, the Yun Isang Competition in Tongyeong sees fierce competition among musicians every year.

However, in the field of art, there are few competitions, and it's difficult to quantify scores.

Thus, the country granted an exemption only to the one person who won the grand prize in the Korean Art Contest.

The problem, as expected, was the rampant lobbying.

With only one person in the entire country receiving the exemption, the competition was fierce.

People began offering millions of won to the judges to win the prize.

Especially since the executives running the Korean Art Contest started sharing the prize among their students, family, and relatives...

Talented artists didn't get the benefits, and many didn't even know such a system existed.

As a result, the quality of winning works declined, and the state decided to abolish this special military service exemption.

This year is the last.

Go Haeyoung clasped her hands together and spoke seriously.

"Of course, Kang Lim could participate in the Korean Art Contest, but winning the grand prize is impossible. It's already decided; it can't be changed."

"Damn it! That's nonsense! If he doesn't win the grand prize, who does?"

"It's true. I didn't win the grand prize either."

"No! That's because you were young and not good enough! Kang Lim can do it now."

"..."

"And Junhee was exempted too! He won the grand prize with his talent. There's no way he offered money, considering his cool personality."

"Junhee himself is a kind of lobbying. How many people want to impress Jeil Group?"

"Argh!"

Ignoring Gerald's frantic outburst, Go Haeyoung turned her body slightly and looked out the window, reminiscing about the past.

The early twenties when she enlisted...

With eyes closed in deep thought, she said,

"On the contrary, going might be good. It could add depth to his work. There are various human experiences there, and he'll think deeply about the relationship between individuals and groups. And if Kang Lim goes, he'll be loved for his good drawings."

"What nonsense!"

"What do you know, as a foreigner? Every man should serve in the military; it's a noble duty to protect the country."

"Old fart!"

"..."

"Get out of my lab!"

"...This is my lab. I wish you'd leave now."

"Even if you say that, I'll make sure Kang Lim participates in the Korean Art Contest when the announcement is made! Just wait and see."

Annoyed by Go Haeyoung's indifferent response, Gerald stomped out of the lab.

After Gerald left, Go Haeyoung continued to look through the portfolio Kang Lim had submitted.

Savoring each piece of artwork...

She leaned back and looked up at the ceiling.

With her eyes closed again, she thought of a new challenge.

A challenge that could bring out Kang Lim's masterpiece...

* * *

The next day.

Getting off at Gangnam Station, Kang Lim took a deep breath.

Cars passed by quickly, and tall buildings rose high.

Banks, corporate offices, and college prep academiesâ€”this was a place where people of all ages gathered.

When he recently held an exhibition in Insadong, he hadn't expected to have a solo exhibition so soon...

Things went better than expected, and he felt good about it.

Kang Lim quickly passed a large intersection and arrived at the Baekyeon Gallery.

The geometric building stood prominently on the main street.

Its striking design made it clear that it was an exhibition hall, even without entering.

'It really looks more like a museum than a gallery...'

Entering the building, he saw the paintings of the artist currently on exhibit.

A fantastical world painted in cool magenta and ultramarine hues.

In the painting filled with poisonous mushrooms, endangered animals were happily playing.

It was a beautiful yet eerie landscape.

'Oh, what an imaginative artist... The theme looks very intuitive...'

Kang Lim slowly admired the paintings.

In the quiet exhibition hall, the sound of his footsteps echoed, and then another set of footsteps joined.

Turning around, he saw Ha Baekyeon smiling brightly.

"Are you Kang Lim?"

"Oh, are you the curator?"

"Yes, I'm the curator and also the director here! I'm Ha Baekyeon. Nice to meet you."

"Oh! Nice to meet you too. How did you recognize me right away? I didn't attach a photo to my portfolio."

Kang Lim was surprised that she recognized him, as he could have easily been mistaken for a regular visitor.

Ha Baekyeon laughed and said,

"Oh, I did some searching. You have quite a unique life story. Didn't you win the grand prize at Korial Fresh? Your face looked exactly like it did in the newspaper. You look great in person too."

"Oh, you saw it there. Haha, thank you."

This feels similar to when I met the publishing editor...

Without realizing it, Kang Lim was gaining fame here and there.

It made sense since his occasional exhibitions and competitions were all reported in the news.

"Let's go into the meeting room and talk."

* * *

Entering the curatorial office, he saw the piled-up portfolios submitted for the competition.

Seeing the overwhelming amount, Kang Lim realized how precious this opportunity was for him.

But Ha Baekyeon's thoughts were the opposite.

She thought it was a stroke of luck that Kang Lim had come.

With sparkling eyes, she said,

"Kang Lim, thank you so much for applying to our gallery competition. It's been a long time since I've met an artist who made my heart race."

"Thank you. Baekyeon Gallery is an amazing place."

"Really, your work perfectly matches our exhibition theme, and your work is fantastic, not to mention your personal story is so intriguing. You're definitely someone destined for greatness."

"Thank you very much."

"I mean it. Now, let me explain the exhibition details!"

"Okay."

"The paintings in the current exhibition you saw earlier will be taken down in two weeks. After the paintings are removed, the solo exhibition for this competition will start the week after that. So, we have four weeks."

"I see. How many participants are there in this relay solo exhibition?"

"We selected five artists. You'll be the first to open the exhibition. The image for the relay exhibition is the initial artist's work, so this is the time with the highest attention. That's why we always send the best image first."

"Oh..."

"That's why your series of 24 pieces is already being made into a catalog. It will be provided on the opening day of the exhibition. And we'll handle the transportation, so just text me the address of your studio, and we'll bring it in."

"Thank you."

"And how should we set the price for your works?"

As expected, Kang Lim shook his head at the question.

His eyes were firm.

"Ah, these are pieces I really cherish, so I don't want to sell them. We don't have to sell them, right?"

"Of course not! There's no rule requiring it. It's just something we have to ask for the exhibition."

The paintings Kang Lim mentioned yesterday from Picasso's Blue Period are closely tied to his life and rare, making them expensive.

Similarly, Kang Lim's current works reflect his life and are a series of only 24 pieces, so selling them cheaply like his previous group exhibition would be foolish.

It would be like selling the paintings for a pittance.

Moreover, for Kang Lim, it wasn't about the money; he cherished the series itself.

He didn't want this exhibition to be the end for these works.

'I want to hold exhibitions in other places and share my work with as many people as possible. These paintings are the starting point of my artistic career and hold great significance...'

Reading Kang Lim's mind, Ha Baekyeon smiled.

She liked him even more for knowing his worth.

"I also think it would be ridiculous to sell these paintings at the price of a college student's work. It would be better to hold onto them until your name becomes well-known and then put them up for auction."

In fact, Ha Baekyeon wanted to offer Kang Lim an exclusive contract.

Having such an artist and splitting the proceeds 50-50 would make the gallery a lot of money.

However, her love for art didn't allow her to tie him down.

She knew better than anyone that he needed to go out into the wider world.

Looking through Kang Lim's portfolio, Ha Baekyeon spoke.

"Ah! Lastly, I have a question about the exhibition planning. Why are there 24 pieces in the series?"

Kang Lim was surprised by Ha Baekyeon's keen question.

He had hidden significant meaning in the number itself.

"Wow, you noticed that I deliberately made 24 pieces!"

"No, I don't know the meaning, but it seemed like an odd number, so I wondered if there was a significance."

"Yes! There is. These paintings contain the emotions of human joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. Simply put, it's four emotions. Even joy alone can branch into joy, hope, satisfaction, peace... many different forms, right? And it can mix with opposite emotions like sorrow.

Humans experience multiple emotions simultaneously, and I thought these complex stories were similar to weather. Even on a sunny day, a sudden shower can come."

"Yes, that's true."

"The landscapes outside the windows in these paintings actually depict Korea's 24 seasonal divisions. I chose scenes that best matched my mother's emotional state. That's why there are 24 pieces."

Ha Baekyeon was surprised by the unexpected content.

"Wow, that's amazing. So you painted the 24 seasonal emotions?"

"Oh, I like how that sounds."

Listening to Kang Lim, Ha Baekyeon began to think of what to write for the exhibition preface and the planning concept.

"Good thing I asked. I'll refer to your portfolio content and make sure to set it up well."

"Thank you. So I just need to handle the transportation?"

"Yes! Since you're here, let's have dinner together."

Kang Lim looked at his phone with a troubled expression.

It was a bit tight to get to Pyeongchang-dong.

"Ah, I'm sorry. I have an appointment for dinner today."

"Oh, that's unfortunate. Then let's talk again when the paintings are transported."

"Yes, thank you. See you then."

Bidding farewell, Kang Lim stood up.

Ha Baekyeon could only watch as he left the gallery.

Seeing the broad shoulders of a twenty-year-old student, she wondered how much he could grow in the future.

She felt a bit of regret at not being able to keep such an artist.
