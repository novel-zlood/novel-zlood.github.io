## Episode 56: Into the Wide World

Gerald finished his class and rushed into Koo Haeyoung's lab huffing and puffing.

It was time to eat dinner, but something much more important was this portfolio.

He wanted to show Koo Haeyoung the portfolio containing hundreds of drawings submitted by Kang Lim as soon as possible.

During class, he found Kang Lim's calm demeanor somewhat annoying and tried to hide his surprise.

But no matter how hard he thought about it, it was beyond his imagination.

"Haeyoung! This is huge!"

A booming voice echoed.

Koo Haeyoung raised an eyebrow at the sight of Gerald barging in.

He was about to leave work, and Gerald's intrusion seemed bothersome.

As Koo Haeyoung put on the jacket draped over his chair, he spoke.

"Did you come because of Junhee? I know he came to Korea recently. I also know that he is planning a seminar with juniors next week."

Gerald shouted, having guessed wrongly.

"No, it's not that! Junhee isn't the issue right now!"

"Then what?"

"I told the kids to bring the drawings they had done during class, right?"

"So you did."

"But Kang Lim submitted a portfolio with 200 pieces! And he said he has ten times more at home! Isn't that insane?"

"...What?"

Koo Haeyoung's expression seemed to ask if it was true.

Seeing his disbelief, Gerald shouted even louder.

"That's what I'm saying! I couldn't believe it at first either! I honestly thought there would be a few hundred pieces, but I had no idea it would be this much! And it's not just the quantity; you have to see the quality of the drawings. Look at these right now!"

Gerald pushed four thick binders into Koo Haeyoung's chest.

Koo Haeyoung, taken aback, received the binders and sat back down in his chair.

As he cautiously turned the cover, his hands began to tremble.

* * *

After flipping through the pages for a long time, Koo Haeyoung's eyes sank into darkness.

He couldn't help but nod slowly at the endless depth of the drawings.

His usually upright posture started to falter.

Gerald, irritated by the slow pace, hovered around restlessly.

Already talkative, he was even noisier and his eyebrows were arched up more than usual.

Finally, unable to bear it any longer, Gerald shouted.

"Agh! You've seen everything, right? Why are you so slow!"

"Yeah, it's really surprising. There are many works here better than the ones you've bought."

Gerald nodded brightly with a big smile.

"Right? First, let's exempt him from the military."

"What nonsense is that?"

Seeing that Koo Haeyoung didn't catch on quickly, Gerald shook his head.

"Our country is great, but we have to go to the military during the best and youngest years. It's so sad... If he could hold an exhibition at a famous overseas museum at that young age, he could bring great honor to our country. It's such a waste!"

"It's strange to hear you call our country 'ours.'"

Gerald's Korean was excessively patched.

"I've lived here too long!"

"Hmph..."

"Anyway! If he wins the grand prize at the Korea Art Exhibition, he'll be exempt from the military. I’ll tell Kang Lim to participate when the announcement comes out. You should recommend him for next year's biennale. He needs to be known to many people and go out into the wide world."

"...The biennale is held every two years. Next year's participants are probably already decided. Even if I recommend him, it would be for the biennale three years from now."

"Damn it!"

"And I think this year is the last year the Korea Art Exhibition offers military exemptions. They're planning to abolish it next year."

"Why?"

"Because of too much corruption."

Music, dance, sports, and fine arts - fields that show distinct talent - are given exemption benefits under the Military Service Act.

For example, the Yun I-sang Competition held in Tongyeong sees fierce competition among musicians every year.

However, in the case of art, there are few competitive contests, and it’s an ambiguous field where it's hard to score points.

So the government gave exemption benefits to only one person who won the grand prize at the Korea Art Exhibition.

The problem was that, as expected, there was a lot of lobbying.

Since only one person across the country could receive it, the competition was fierce.

People started giving millions of won to the judges to win the prize.

Especially, the disciples, family, and relatives of the executives running the Korea Art Exhibition began to share the prizes among themselves.

As a result, truly talented artists didn't receive benefits, and many didn't even know such a system existed.

Because of this, the quality of prize-winning works in the contest declined, and the government decided to abolish this military exemption.

This year is the last year.

Koo Haeyoung intertwined his fingers and spoke with a serious expression.

"Of course, Kang Lim can participate in the Korea Art Exhibition, but winning the grand prize is impossible. It's already decided, and it can't be changed."

"Damn it! That's nonsense! Who else but him deserves the grand prize."

"It's true. I couldn't win the grand prize either."

"No! That was because young you were less skilled! Kang Lim can do it now."

"..."

"And Junhee was exempted too! He won the grand prize with his skill. There's no way he would have bribed anyone; he's too cool for that."

"Junhee himself is a lobby. There are so many people who want to be in the good graces of Jeil Group."

"Argh!"

Ignoring Gerald's frantic shouting, Koo Haeyoung turned his body slightly to look out the window.

He stared blankly outside, recalling his early twenties when he was enlisted.

With his eyes closed, he spoke as if deeply immersed in thought.

"Actually, it might be good if he goes. It could add depth to his work. There, he will encounter a wide variety of human types and deeply contemplate the relationship between individuals and groups. And if Kang Lim goes, he'll draw well and be loved by people."

"What nonsense!"

"What do you know, as a foreigner? All men should serve in the military. It's a noble duty to protect the country."

"You old fogey!"

"..."

"Get out of my lab!"

"...This is my lab. I wish you would leave now."

"Even if you say that, I'll make sure Kang Lim participates when the Korea Art Exhibition announcement comes out! Just wait and see."

Ignoring Koo Haeyoung's indifferent reaction, Gerald stormed out, huffing.

After Gerald left, Koo Haeyoung continued to look through the portfolio submitted by Kang Lim.

As he pondered over each piece of artwork...

He tilted his head back and looked up at the ceiling.

With his eyes closed again, he began to think of a new task.

A problem that could draw out Kang Lim's masterpiece...

* * *

The next day.

After getting off at Gangnam Station, Kang Lim took a deep breath.

Cars sped by, and tall skyscrapers loomed.

Banks, corporate offices, and college prep academies made it a good location to meet people of all ages.

When he had an exhibition in Insadong recently, he didn't expect to hold a solo exhibition so soon...

Things had gone better than he thought, making him feel good.

Kang Lim walked past a large intersection and quickly arrived at Baekyeon Gallery.

The geometric building stood right on the main road.

The eye-catching design made it clear it was an exhibition hall even without entering.

'It's too big to be called a gallery; it feels more like a museum...'

Inside, he saw the works of the current exhibition artist.

A fantasy world painted in cold magenta and ultramarine hues.

In the pictures where poisonous mushrooms bloomed, endangered animals frolicked happily.

It was a beautiful yet eerie landscape.

'Oh, this artist has a good imagination... The theme looks very intuitive...'

Kang Lim slowly admired the paintings.

The quiet exhibition hall echoed with the sound of footsteps, and then another set of footsteps overlapped.

When he turned around, Ha Baekyeon was smiling brightly.

"Are you Kang Lim?"

"Oh, are you the curator?"

"Yes, I'm the curator and the director here! I'm Ha Baekyeon. Nice to meet you."

"Oh! Nice to meet you. How did you recognize me right away? I didn't attach a photo to the portfolio."

Kang Lim was surprised that she recognized him, even though he could have been mistaken for a regular visitor.

Ha Baekyeon smiled and said.

"Oh, of course, I searched this and that. You have such a unique life story. I saw you also won the grand prize at Corial Fresh? You look just like the face I saw in the newspaper. You look great in person too."

"Oh, you saw that. Haha, thank you."

This feels similar to when I met the editor from the publishing house...

Unknowingly, Kang Lim was gaining fame here and there.

That was because his occasional exhibitions and contest participations were all reported in the news.

"Let's go into the meeting room and talk."

* * *

When they entered the curator's office, there were stacks of portfolios submitted for this competition.

Seeing the amount that would be difficult to go through all, Kang Lim realized how precious this opportunity was.

But Ha Baekyeon thought the opposite.

She felt it was a stroke of luck that Kang Lim came.

With sparkling eyes, she said.

"Thank you so much for applying to our gallery competition, Kang Lim. It's been a long time since I've met an artist who makes my heart race."

"Thank you too. Baekyeon Gallery is a great place."

"Really, your work fits perfectly with the theme of our exhibition, and the quality of your work is excellent. Plus, your personal story is so intriguing. You are definitely someone who will make it big."

"Oh, thank you very much."

"I'm serious. Now, let me explain the exhibition details!"

"Yes."

"The exhibition you saw earlier will end in two weeks. Once the paintings are taken down, the solo exhibitions from this competition will start the week after. So you have four weeks left."

"Ah, how many people are participating in this relay solo exhibition?"

"We selected five people. You'll be the first one to open the exhibition. The first artist's work sets the tone for the relay exhibition, so it gets the most attention. That's why we send the best image first."

"Oh..."

"So the series of 24 pieces you've created is already being made into a catalog. It will be available at the exhibition opening. We'll take care of the transportation, so just text me your studio address, and we'll pick them up."

"Yes, thank you."

"And how about the pricing for your works?"

At the expected question, Kang Lim shook his head firmly.

His eyes were resolute.

"Oh, I really don't want to sell these works. It's not mandatory to sell them, right?"

"Of course not! There's no such rule. It's just a requirement to ask during the exhibition."

The paintings from the "Blue Period" of Picasso that Kang Lim mentioned yesterday are closely related to the artist's life and are rare, making them expensive.

Similarly, Kang Lim's current series reflects his life and consists of only 24 pieces, so selling them cheaply like his previous group exhibition works would be foolish.

That would be selling them at a giveaway price.

Moreover, for Kang Lim, it wasn't about the money; he cherished this series itself.

He didn't want to end with just one exhibition here.

'I want to hold exhibitions elsewhere and share my work with as many people as possible. These paintings mark the beginning of my artistic journey and hold great significance...'

Sensing Kang Lim’s thoughts, Ha Baekyeon smiled.

She was more pleased with Kang Lim, who seemed to understand his worth.

"I also think it would be ridiculous to sell these paintings at a price suitable for a college student. I hope you hold onto them and auction them when your name becomes more known."

In fact, Ha Baekyeon wanted to offer Kang Lim a contract as an exclusive artist.

With such an artist, the gallery could make a lot of money by splitting the artwork's value 50/50.

However, her conscience as a lover of art didn't allow her to tie him down.

She knew better than anyone that he needed to go out into the wider world.

Ha Baekyeon checked Kang Lim’s portfolio as she spoke.

"Oh! Lastly, I have one question about the exhibition planning. Why is the series exactly 24 pieces?"

Surprised by Ha Baekyeon's sharp question, Kang Lim was taken aback.

The number itself held hidden meaning.

"Wow, you noticed that I made it 24 pieces on purpose!"

"No, I don’t know the meaning, but it’s an odd number, so I wondered if it had significance."

"Yes, it does. These paintings capture the human emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. These emotions are simply four basic ones, but even joy alone can branch into various feelings like euphoria, hope, satisfaction, and peace. They can also mix with opposite emotions like sorrow.

This way, humans experience multiple emotions at once, and I thought those complex stories resembled the weather. The weather can be sunny, then suddenly there’s a rain shower.

The landscapes outside the window in these paintings portray the unpredictable 24 seasonal divisions we experience in Korea. I chose scenes that best matched my mother's emotional states. That’s why it's 24 pieces."

Ha Baekyeon, astonished by the unexpected explanation, said.

"Wow, I see. So you painted the 24 seasonal emotions?"

"Oh, I like how you put it."

Listening to Kang Lim, Ha Baekyeon began to think of the words for the exhibition preface and the planning concept.

"I’m glad I asked. I’ll refer to your portfolio content and set up the exhibition accordingly."

"Thank you. Then, I just need to handle the transportation?"

"Yes! Since you're here, how about joining us for dinner?"

With a troubled look, Kang Lim checked his phone.

It would be tight to get to Pyeongchang-dong on time.

"Oh, I'm sorry. I have another appointment for dinner tonight."

"Oh, that's too bad. Let's talk again when we transport the paintings."

"Yes, thank you. See you next time."

Saying goodbye, Kang Lim stood up.

Ha Baekyeon could only watch him leave the gallery.

How could a twenty-year-old student look so broad-shouldered? How much more could he grow?

Feeling a bit regretful about not being able to keep such a promising artist, she sighed.
