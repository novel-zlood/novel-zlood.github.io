## Episode 82: Omen

A Fairy Pitta, known as "gin-kkori-ddak-sae" in Korean. True to its name, it boasts a tail longer than its body and has a blue band around its eyes.

This bird, beautiful enough to remind one of paradise, is unfortunately an endangered species.

In Korea, it can occasionally be spotted in valleys or bamboo groves between May and June.

'After enduring the long winter, the bamboo grove, which will nurture countless lives again when summer comes... Is it a wish to keep its greenness till the end...?'

The association president could not forget the moment he saw the bird take flight.

It was more poignant because it was drawn in shadows.

The president had always been criticized for his lack of discernment, but a good piece of artwork awakened him.

Although he liked all oriental paintings, this was the first time he had seen such a beautiful piece.

'Moreover... considering what the Korean painting professor said, it's not just a magnificent painting.'

The president recalled the professor who shook his head in disbelief.

A gaping mouth.

When asked how it was painted, the professor said he didn't know either.

[In oriental painting pigments, to create a thick texture, clam powder like "hobun" or seaweed is often used.

But it's just applied thicker compared to regular powder pigments... This kind of protruding painting is impossible. It's at the level of a relief sculpture.

As you know, a lot of time has passed since the first submission of the contest.

Despite this, this piece has not cracked or peeled at all.

If hobun is applied this thickly in a dry season, it can't withstand it.

This means... the artist knows a golden ratio that I don't know. It's a secret that comes from long research.]

The president, looking frustrated, slammed the desk.

He bit his lower lip and said.

"We must purchase this. Let's buy it with the contest prize money!"

Here we go again, making things difficult.

The secretary sighed internally.

She didn't know how many times she had to explain that it was impossible.

"President, we can't do that. Due to the difficulty of managing the awarded works we have collected so far, we decided to reduce the prize money and not purchase any works from this year. All works except the ones purchased by corporations are to be returned after the exhibition."

"Most of the artists will think we always purchase the works! We can just pretend it didn't happen!"

"Impossible. One of the reasons why there are so many applicants this year is because there's no purchase prize. We even wrote it in the contest guidelines."

"Ugh! No!"

The president's chest ached.

His shoulders slumped...

He couldn't muster strength in his joints.

"Let's just sneakily change the contest poster."

"The Korean Art Competition is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. It's the biggest contest in Korea, no matter what anyone says. We can't just change things recklessly. We've had many inquiries about this."

"The president wants to do it, can't we?"

"That's like telling a writer who won a literary contest that the prize money isn't pure prize money but an advance payment. It's like giving and then taking back."

Indeed. Such changes were like a thug's behavior.

The president knew this too.

He just didn't want to admit it.

That he had dug his own grave...

The secretary smiled unnecessarily.

To the president, it looked a bit annoying.

"President, won't Kang Lim's work come up for auction someday? You can buy it then."

"How can I win an auction! There are so many people crazy about collecting oriental paintings!"

"Really… But if it has value, shouldn't you make a big investment?"

"......"

Faces of various corporate presidents flashed through the president's mind.

These old geezers...

Their tastes are all similar.

A few days later, during the final presentation.

Kang Lim was listening to Lee Sora's presentation.

It was Gerald's assignment to draw what artists need.

‘Is that her sister's house?’

A room painted on a small canvas.

The small one-room, like an examination dormitory, was filled with items left behind by people who had used them.

It was a work that depicted the warmth and traces of someone who had stayed there.

"I drew my parents' guesthouse, which is now closed, remembering the days when they ran a lodging business. While drawing, it felt like breathing new life into it. Artists need the eye to look again at objects left behind, which someone might just pass by, don't you think?"

Gerald burst out laughing.

Pleasant wrinkles formed beside his eyes.

"Ha ha, so the first year is over now... The little ones have improved a lot. Then next week..."

The students swallowed nervously, looking at Gerald.

Their eyes reflected anxiety.

With only a week left before the end of the term, why finish the assignment presentation so vaguely?

Surely, he's not going to give another assignment...

"Next week, the end of term class will be at Heyum Art Museum! No reports, just viewing, and that's it!"

"Wow—!"

The students whistled as they looked at Kang Lim.

A fervent cheer. He was their savior.

‘...What is this again?’

Kang Lim felt a bit embarrassed that his solo exhibition would become a class.

Well, he'd be very grateful if everyone came...

After Gerald's class, Kang Lim and Seo Yeon chose the food for the opening catering.

Kang Lim chose purely based on what he wanted to eat.

"By the way, is it okay to choose so freely? Isn't it too late?"

"It's a fixed company we've been working with, so it's fine. Whenever we send the menu, it comes out like a set."

"Oh... that's cool. I also like that it's far from the exhibition space."

"Yeah, Heyum originally has the catering booth separated from the exhibition space. No food allowed inside."

"Probably because it's hard to clean a large art museum."

"Haha, no. It's to maintain the mystery your paintings give."

"I know, I'm joking."

Buzzz—

Kang Lim's phone rang.

"Oh, just a moment. It's Mr. Joo Young."

With the solo exhibition approaching, there were many things to check.

[Kim Joo Young: Are you satisfied with the sculpture delivery?]

[Kang Lim: Of course, whose work do you think it is? The display is already finished.]

[Kim Joo Young: Oh my, I'm benefiting from having connections with a famous artist!]

[Kang Lim: I might need to enter overseas museums soon.]

[Kim Joo Young: Haha. I like your ambition! But, won't it look less like a rock with just the sheet attached... Is it okay? There are limits even if the texture is rocky.]

[Kang Lim: The sheet is the basic background, and I mixed it with gel stone to describe parts.]

[Kim Joo Young: Then won't it be too rough to sit on?]

[Kang Lim: Haha. The sitting part is obviously just painted. Don't worry.]

[Kim Joo Young: Well, of course, you would do it well! I'll come to see the exhibition.]

[Kang Lim: Thank you!]

After confirming the message, the vibration continued.

But... it wasn't the phone's vibration.

It was the students running, causing the classroom floor to vibrate.

Lee Hyunseong shouted from the front.

"Hey, man! You should have told us if you did something like this!"

The classmates hit Kang Lim with rolled-up magazines.

On the cover was a focused image of Kang Lim working.

A keen look measuring precise proportions.

To think that making a half-mold could look this cool...

Admiring inwardly, Kang Lim took the magazine.

"Wow, the person who took this for Campus Tomorrow must become a celebrity."

"Kang Lim will probably become something like a semi-celebrity too."

"I'm jealous. Doing a cover model."

Lee Hyunseong said in a loud voice.

"Read it quickly!"

[Cover Model! Kang Lim from the Sculpture Department of Korea National University of Arts.]

(Photo)

- White skin and jet-black eyes.

Kang Lim, who reminds one of winter, fits perfectly as the December cover model.

(Photo)

- Working on the base of an oriental painting at Heyum Residency. Even the editor, who majored in oriental painting, was impressed by the professionalism. How can a professor be seen in a twenty-year-old student...

A series that has been drawn since he was six years old!

Debuting with the solo exhibition <24 Solar Terms of Emotions> and causing a stir on the internet.

The protagonist of a very busy schedule, we managed to meet Kang Lim.

His words seem to contain very precise meanings.

From light questions to profound views on art!

How does a genius art student live?

Campus Tomorrow has an in-depth interview.

Q: What is the charm of the Sculpture Department at Korea National University of Arts? It's such an elite school that readers must be very curious. Also, are you popular, Kang Lim?

- We learn a lot of different things. It's like combining all the art departments of other schools... It's hard because of the many assignments, and my classmates are really skilled. They have good personalities too. Does saying this make me popular?

Q: Haha. It seems so. Recently, you seem to be living a busier life than anyone else. Is it hard?

- I am grateful to be busy. My body is a bit tired from working late almost every day, but my mind is happy.

Q: It's the same for other art students to not avoid night work. (Laughs)

I heard that your recent solo exhibition attracted the most visitors in the shortest time in the history of Korean galleries. What do you think is the key to its success?

- I think it's because my life story was published here and there, which stirred curiosity.

Also, the keyword 'emotion' seems to have formed a consensus.

The paintings are about my mother, but the audience must have found their own emotions and memories in them.

Everyone tries to appear rational on the surface, but there's often a lot of contradictions and chaos underneath.

Q: You have received very good reviews in the industry. You are recognized for establishing your own painting world through 15 years of intense effort.

In contemporary art, where installation art, video art, and experimental art styles are prevalent, why did you debut with the most traditional 'painting' work?

- Because it is the work that marked the starting point of my art life. Although I like painting work, I plan to work in various genres.

Q: People are really curious about what kind of contemporary art Kang Lim, who is loved by many, will do. What kind of work will you do in the future?

- Actually, I like the concept of contemporary art. The scope of art expands infinitely as it uses everything in the world as material.

When journalists write provocative articles that become internet memes, people often think of expensive, incomprehensible works sold at auctions when they think of contemporary art...

But if you actually go to contemporary art museums, there are really many diverse and good works.

If artists try to communicate with the audience, and the audience tries to understand the artists a bit, wouldn't great art genres be born?

Unseen new attempts... work that communicates with people and shares meaning...

If I could be a bit greedier, I want to create works that feel different every time you see them.

So that their value does not diminish even as time passes.

Q: Indeed... you are ambitious! But it seems like you can do it, Kang Lim. In that sense, do you have any exhibitions you recommend to the readers?

- If you want to meet young contemporary artists, I recommend the exhibitions at alternative spaces that are increasing these days.

When asked to give advice to fellow art students, Kang Lim, who said he was a lucky person,

He ended the interview by saying that he wants to help struggling artists as much as he has been helped.

How deep and humble he is...

It's just a pity that we couldn't capture his unique worldview in a short interview!

If you want to know more about him, why not visit his solo exhibition at Heyum Art Museum on December 12?

After the solo exhibition, he will be working at a residency in Paris and participating in the Venice Biennale next summer...

If you're a domestic fan, you must visit this exhibition!

* * *

After reading the article, the students rubbed their eyes.

They knew their classmate was a genius, but his career was too far ahead.

To think he would go this far.

"What is this? What's this last part?"

"Kang Lim, are you participating in the Venice Biennale...?"

"Truly another level, have you gone to Andromeda."

Kang Lim rubbed the back of his neck and said.

"Yeah, it turned out that way."

"No! You should tell us about these things... This is more shocking than being a cover model."

Shin Tae Min showed Kang Lim the screen of the portal site.

"No wonder... you reclaimed the top search query. Look at this."

Buzzz—

The phone continued to ring incessantly.

They said the news would spread as soon as the magazine was released...

It was exactly as the editor said.

Kang Lim scrolled down to check the most important messages first.

[Ryu Miyeon: Shall we meet at the planning office tomorrow? I have something to say.]
