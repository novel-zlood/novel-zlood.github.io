## Episode 66: Solo Exhibition

[Kang Lim's First Solo Exhibition, A Series of Works Painted Since He Was Six - 24 Solar Terms of Emotions]

Kang Lim (19) will hold his first solo exhibition on Saturday, November 11, at Baekyeon Gallery.

This series of 24 works was created in a unique way, relying solely on memory without referencing photographic materials. These paintings, completed over 15 years since Kang Lim began his artistic journey, are the closest to the artist's life.

Who could be the subject that Kang Lim, who said 'human emotions resemble the weather,' has continuously observed?

The special behind-the-scenes stories of the artist can be found at Baekyeon Gallery's solo exhibition.

Baekyeon Gallery Director Ha Baekyeon (44) mentioned that this solo exhibition will allow visitors to truly feel the process of Kang Lim's 15-year development, mature brushstrokes, and sculptural sense.

Below is one of the series painted by Kang Lim at the age of six.

Industry experts mentioned that Kang Lim is not a rookie who appeared like a comet but has already made a mark since the group exhibition at Insadong Ian Gallery and created special works that communicate with the audience through Seoul's public sculptures.

Moreover, Director Ha Baekyeon, who planned the Venice Biennale in 1995 and brought a special award to Korea, expressed high expectations, stating that the best artist and planner have met.

If there is an exhibition you must see this year, wouldn't it be Kang Lim's first solo exhibition?

Below is the map to Baekyeon Gallery. Admission is free.

- Best Comments

- ……? Is that really painted when he was six? LOL Did I read the article wrong?
└ This guy is just a genius… Where did all those who said it was an advertorial go?
└ They all disappeared LOL.
└ No, he drew the person like they're alive;;
└ He painted the person realistically, but the background is semi-abstract, which adds more feeling. The atmosphere is quite unique.
└ And he's the same person who made the sculpture at Hongdae ㄷㄷ.

- What does it mean to paint solely from memory… To draw such a realistic painting without photo references……?
└ But if he painted that at six, what level is his current work ㄷㄷ.
└ Is it something like hyperthymesia or savant syndrome?
└ What's that?
└ It's the ability to remember everything without forgetting.
└ ㅁㅊ;;

- By the way, who is the woman in the painting with that scary expression?
└ Right, they should have added a description! The thing Koreans hate the most is stopping mid-sentence, the second thing is……
└ The article makes it impossible not to go.
└ It's free, should I check it out? I've never gone to see an exhibition, but I really want to see this LOL.

Gerald checked the article posted yesterday and replied to the last best comment.

└ I'm on my way now. See you later~, hehe.

‘As expected, Ha Baekyeon is amazing. Typical exhibition promotion articles are posted at least 2 to 3 weeks in advance to draw a crowd, but posting it just two days before is a complete gamble.’

It showed how well she understood the industry.

People curious after reading Heeyum's article naturally flocked to related articles, and even after 24 hours, Kang Lim was still at the top of search rankings.

Her prediction was spot on.

Moreover, the article only piqued curiosity.

It was written so that one could only get detailed information by visiting the exhibition.

‘I especially like the part where they included a map at the end and mentioned that admission is free…….’

Galleries usually don't charge admission.

However, people often think of museums with high admission fees or believe only art buyers are allowed entry, feeling uncomfortable.

Considering that, it appealed to a broader audience.

Even those uninterested in art would find it worth seeing.

One step, two steps. Rhythmic footsteps.

Gerald hummed a tune as he headed to Baekyeon Gallery.

He couldn't express how happy he was when he found the brochure announcing Kang Lim's solo exhibition in his professor's office mailbox.

Since receiving the solo exhibition invitation, he had been eagerly waiting for the opening ceremony.

The opening ceremony was at 4 PM, but it was currently 10 AM.

Gerald wanted to be the first to see the paintings before anyone else.

‘Typically, hotels or art fairs open first to VIPs. If you want to get good artists' paintings, you have to go before the opening ceremony. They're all mine! Haha!’

For Gerald, who was passionate about collecting paintings, Kang Lim's series was very important.

It marked the beginning of the genius artist's career.

The more he thought about it, the more Kang Lim's series lingered in his mind.

‘The opening ceremony hasn't even started yet, but I hope they're not already sold.’

As soon as Gerald spotted Baekyeon Gallery, he hurriedly opened the door and rushed in.

“Excuse me, is the curator here?”

Seeing a foreigner looking for someone as soon as he entered, Ha Baekyeon was a bit flustered.

Upon closer inspection, the face seemed familiar; he was someone she knew.

Gerald Moore was also a famous superstar in the art world.

“Yes, I am the gallery director. What brings you here? The opening is still 6 hours away.”

“Haha, I came early out of urgency.”

Just then, the door burst open, and Ryu Myeon entered.

Seeing another familiar face, Ha Baekyeon was surprised again.

Coming so early before the opening ceremony, how much must they care for Kang Lim to do this?

And not just anyone, but the professor from Korea's top art university and the director of the top art museum……

Ha Baekyeon alternated her gaze between the two panting individuals.

Ryu Myeon, trying not to reveal how out of breath she was from running, slowly calmed herself and spoke.

“…Baekyeon, it's been a while.”

As Ryu Myeon greeted Ha Baekyeon elegantly, Gerald widened his eyes and asked.

“Oh! Aren't you Ryu Myeon?”

Ryu Myeon also spotted Gerald and widened her eyes.

“Professor Gerald? What brings you here?”

“Well, I'm here to see my student's exhibition. I did the same for Junhee!”

“Oh, right… It's been a long time. Nice to see you.”

The two exchanged awkward greetings.

Ha Baekyeon could see they weren't particularly close.

Rather, there was a strange tension between the famous collectors.

Trying to ease the awkward atmosphere, Ha Baekyeon asked.

“But what brings you both here? The opening ceremony is still 6 hours away.”

Gerald glanced at Ryu Myeon.

If she was here to buy the paintings, it would be bad……

She was someone he couldn't outbid.

In the end, Gerald, worried, spoke urgently.

“I want to buy all 24 paintings here. I said it first! I was first!”

Hearing Gerald's childish tone, Ryu Myeon chuckled in disbelief.

“Ha, Professor… You should love your students equally. Coming to a solo exhibition to buy everything out?”

“Why not? I like the paintings! Equal love, what nonsense… You must think a professor is an elementary school teacher.”

“……”

“And, I'm the king of favoritism. I did the same for Junhee.”

Realizing that elegant persuasion wouldn't work on Gerald, Ryu Myeon made a proposal to Ha Baekyeon.

“Professor, will you buy at the artist's set price? I'll buy at double whatever price the professor offers.”

Ha Baekyeon was at a loss for words, watching the sparks fly between their eyes.

…But she had to say it.

“I'm sorry to tell you both, but……”

They were unaware of an important fact.

“These works are not for sale. The artist did not wish to sell them.”

Gerald and Ryu Myeon stared at each other, dumbfounded.

Disappointment slowly filled their empty gaze.

Kang Lim had outdone them.

* * *

“Kang Lim! It's time to eat. Get up now.”

Kang Lim opened his eyes to his father's voice, shaking him awake.

Sleepily glancing at the clock on the wall, it was 12 PM.

He must have slept until noon.

“Oh… I slept a lot. I must be crazy.”

“Yeah, you slept like someone knocked out. You looked exhausted, so I left you alone.”

“Really… But I feel completely rested.”

Kang Lim stretched his arms and said.

“Dad, you'll come to the solo exhibition opening tomorrow, right? It's Saturday.”

“Of course, I'll go. But it's today, not tomorrow.”

“What?”

“You slept for over a day.”

Is it possible for someone to sleep that much……

Blinking in disbelief, his father showed him the date on his phone.

No matter how much he rubbed his eyes, it was indeed Saturday, November 11th.

Realizing it, he felt ravenously hungry.

A loud growl echoed.

“Are you very hungry?”

“Yes, I am. It feels like a day has been deleted, and my body doesn't lie.”

“We'll be heading to the exhibition soon, so eat up. You should have brunch.”

“I was planning to eat lightly since there'd be catering with lots of good food, but I'm too hungry for that.”

Kang Lim got up and went to the kitchen.

A hearty meal of soybean paste stew, sweet anchovy stir-fry, and fried eggs… A neat home-cooked meal awaited.

Honestly, in his current state, anything would taste good.

Im Yujin smiled brightly as she approached Kang Lim.

“Kang Lim, look at this before you eat!”

“Can't I look while eating……”

“Oh, fine. Keep eating.”

Im Yujin busily walked to the bedroom and brought out a black jacket and pants.

“Isn't it nice? I bought this for you to wear today.”

“Why bother with clothes? I can just wear anything.”

“That's why I bought it. It's your first solo exhibition, and you should look presentable. Journalists will take photos, and you'll have talks with the artist.”

“True, but there won't be that many journalists. Maybe one? And many artists don't dress up much.”

“No, even if there aren't journalists, many people will come. The place will be packed.”

“No way, not many people come to art exhibitions. Especially not galleries. People rarely visit galleries.”

“Really?”

“Yes, it's true. Don't get your hopes up.”

Kang Lim glanced at the jacket set his mother was holding.

It looked much larger than his usual size.

It was deliberately oversized.

‘That style will be a big trend in Hongdae in a few years… Mom sure has a good sense of fashion.’

Im Yujin stroked the clothes and said.

“Anyway, you like it, right? The fabric is good… You'll wear it, right?”

“Yes, I don't care what I wear. I'll just wear a white tee inside.”

“Fine, you'll look great!”

“……”

Kang Lim worriedly looked at his slightly excited mother.

“But Mom, aren't you going to cry when you see the paintings?”

“Why? Because I painted them?”

“Yes.”

“Why would I cry over the past? And I’ve seen those paintings before.”

“There are many recent additions to the series. And paintings feel completely different when displayed in an exhibition. That's why curators exist.”

“Then that's even better! Why cry on a happy day? You’re saying nonsense.”

His father laughed, watching the two.

“Yes, your mom isn't that weak.”

“Right! I'm very strong.”

Kang Lim shook his head, looking at his father.

His mom had a tender heart……

How did she even date… I shouldn't be like that……

* * *

After finishing their meal, Kang Lim and his parents took a taxi.

Though Kang Lim suggested taking the subway to save money and for convenience, his father insisted on treating the artist today, smiling slyly.

Seeing his parents more excited than himself made Kang Lim happy too.

‘If only my phone battery were charged, it would be perfect…….’

A perfect day.

The only downside was discovering his phone was dead when leaving the house. That was frustrating.

Connecting it to a low-quality power bank, it was now barely at 1%.

‘I’ll wait a bit…….’

Kang Lim watched the scenery pass by through the window, lost in thought.

The year was nearly over. Living a busy life made the already fast time fly by even quicker.

* * *

The taxi stopped right in front of Baekyeon Gallery.

A large gallery at the major intersection of Gangnam Station, as expected.

However, Kang Lim reacted unexpectedly upon seeing Baekyeon Gallery.

‘Why… Why is it like that……?’

The gallery's front glass wall was entirely covered with blackout curtains, making it look like it was closed.

‘The main hall paintings attract people inside, but blocking it like that…….’

Museums often keep the lobby empty and start the exhibition on upper floors.

Otherwise, they make a long distance between the exhibition hall and the ticket counter.

It’s like adding a blank page before the title page of a book.

It provides a buffer before immersing into a new world.

However, galleries, unlike museums, are mostly designed with transparent glass walls to allow visibility inside.

Partly due to their smaller size, but also because they lack the fame of renowned museums like Heeyum or DDP.

They need to attract passersby by displaying artworks through the glass to increase visitor numbers.

That’s why the visible space on the first floor plays a crucial role in promotion.

But the curator, who even planned the Biennale, blocked that passage……

Kang Lim couldn’t understand it.

It wasn't favorable for the artist, and even more so for the gallery.

They don’t charge admission, and since it’s a solo exhibition held through an open call, they don’t get a hefty rental fee from the artist.

The gallery's gains from the exhibition are limited to catalog sales and the reputation of having organized a good project.

‘Without promotion, there’s nothing to gain. Why did they cover it…….’

Turning on his phone, now charged to about 15%, Kang Lim entered the gallery.

The moment he stepped in, he understood Ha Baekyeon’s decision.

And his phone started buzzing with notifications like crazy.
