## Episode 35: The Helper

“No way... This isn’t just any feature!”

Kim Jooyoung was amazed as he read through the materials Kang Lim had brought.

As someone who always enjoyed visiting exhibitions and had a keen interest in the art world, his surprise was doubled, even tripled.

“To be featured in the rookie section of Art Magazine K, which is famous for its picky editor. If you had brought just this, I would have given you a discount right away...”

Kim Jooyoung read the magazine article and said, “It’s filled with rave reviews. There are usually a few critical lines in the rookie section articles, but this one is all praise.”

He had planned to buy the magazine after work today.

But it was more than just a gift; someone he knew was featured in it.

“Take a look at this too.”

Kang Lim handed over the latest issue of Tomorrow’s Art University magazine, which featured his high school joint exam artwork.

Kim Jooyoung’s eyes, which seemed like they couldn’t get any wider, grew even larger.

It looked like they might pop out if someone hit him.

“Wow... What is this? Professor Park Pyeongsik never gives compliments. You’ve stood out since high school? Well, I had a feeling when you handled modeling tools so well.”

It was the first time he had seen a student draw entrance exam artwork in such a unique way.

Kang Lim seemed to think entirely differently from others.

[Breaking the set hierarchy, a student who stands out], [A student with a challenging experimental spirit against the existing authority], [A promising talent expected to hold solo exhibitions], [An artwork that captivates the audience to the point of breathlessness]...

The descriptions of Kang Lim varied across the two magazines.

He had never seen a twenty-year-old with so many accolades.

“Haha.”

Kim Jooyoung looked at Kang Lim with disbelief.

He hadn’t realized he was such a precious guest.

“Mister, I also did the illustrations for these anatomy books. My name is listed on the last page. I worked on them with my professor.”

“...”

Aren’t anatomy books specialized texts that require not only artistic skills but also medical knowledge?

Could a student really work on such books with a professor?

What exactly can’t this guy do?

Kim Jooyoung was at a loss for words as he kept uncovering more of Kang Lim’s achievements.

“This will also be included in the next curriculum textbook.”

“...”

Kim Jooyoung looked at the high school art textbook that Kang Lim handed over last.

“This isn’t just a brief feature of a student’s work... You’re featured alongside Albrecht Dürer? He’s the most famous printmaker in Germany.”

Kang Lim’s drypoint artwork was featured in comparison with Albrecht Dürer’s work.

It was used as an example to compare a print following Western chiaroscuro techniques and a unique print using Eastern atmospheric perspective.

In other words, it wasn’t just a passing ‘practice problem 1’ in a math book but a properly examined example.

“Ha... Everything about this is so unique.”

Kim Jooyoung felt an inexplicable lump in his throat.

Although his life had been relatively short, he could feel how hard this student had worked through his artworks.

Even though the photos of the works were much smaller and less moving than seeing them in person...

This was undoubtedly the condensed result of Kang Lim’s prepared and hardworking life so far.

“Student, tell me how much budget you need. I’ll match it no matter what.”

“What...?”

Kang Lim was a bit surprised since students who had received discounts before mostly got around a 10% discount.

Kim Jooyoung’s eyes were burning with determination.

“One is a wooden staircase, and the other is an acrylic sculpture, right? I know a good place that provides raw materials for wood. I’ll take care of everything.”

“Wow, really?”

“Of course. I have a friend who runs a 1,300-pyeong lumber distribution business. They handle everything from manufacturing to wholesale and retail, so we can get it cheap without middleman fees. Leave the woodwork to them, and I’ll handle the acrylic with care.”

“...”

Kang Lim couldn’t respond quickly.

‘I used to envy artists who got discounts here... Now, can I also be trusted just as a person?’

Was it because he knew this man from his past life... He felt an unexpected surge of emotion.

In this new life, it seemed he had gained a reliable helper.

“Mister... Thank you. I was planning to use the cheapest plastic if I couldn’t get a quote.”

“Don’t worry. We’ll use good acrylic. Let’s make it the best.”

“Thank you so much. I feel frustrated that all I can say is thank you.”

“It’s fine. Just don’t pretend you don’t know me when you become famous.”

“Haha. Of course.”

The laughter of the two filled Jooyoung’s workshop.

* * *

Since he had handed over the 3D blueprints to Jooyoung’s workshop, the work was almost done.

Now, it was at the stage where machines would handle everything.

Kang Lim felt a bit relieved.

In such large-scale projects, the company usually comes to assemble and produce the work.

‘But there’s one more crucial thing.’

There was a reason for making a sculpture with a transparent acrylic box.

It was to fill the sculpture with trash.

Bzzz-

Kang Lim quickly answered his vibrating cellphone.

It was Hong Yoonki.

“Where are you! I’m exhausted.”

“I’m almost there. I can see you now.”

Kang Lim hung up and waved enthusiastically at Hong Yoonki, who was standing in front of the art studio.

“Gosh! I’m so tired.”

Hong Yoonki had already moved all the materials Kang Lim needed and was waiting.

‘No wonder he's tired. He must have been constantly picking up, washing, drying trash, and moving stuff.’

Kang Lim couldn’t help but chuckle.

He felt a bit sorry for Lee Hyunseong when he had a hard time... But for this hyung, it felt somewhat satisfying.

“Hey... Stop laughing! I’m dead tired.”

“Haha. Thank you for your hard work.”

“Can we even work here? I’m an outsider.”

“What does it matter if I’m a student here? It’s vacation time.”

“Phew... Thank goodness. I’ve laid out plastic sheets all over the floor.”

“Great.”

“Are we opening the paint now?”

“Wait a moment. Can you give me the receipt?”

Hong Yoonki rummaged through the plastic bag filled with materials bought from the art store and pulled out a crumpled receipt from his pocket.

“Ah, here it is.”

“...”

“Why do you need this?”

“Hyung, this isn’t the first time we’ve done a city-funded project.”

“True.”

“Then we need to take photos. The Seoul city official will evaluate if the budget was spent correctly... Let’s lay out the art store receipts in order, bundle them, and spread them on the floor. We need to attach all the photos later for the final report.”

“Gosh... I know. But there aren’t many officials who are that meticulous.”

“Let’s still do it. It’s all taxpayer money.”

“Okay... Got it.”

Hong Yoonki and Kang Lim lined up various paint cans, large basins, flat brushes, and gilding wax in a row.

‘I remember someone who had a hard time when the official suddenly became meticulous after slacking off on such things before.’

This was also part of Kang Lim’s long experience in the professional world.

Having worked in the industry as a designer for a long time, he knew better.

Hong Yoonki looked at Kang Lim, who was handling things skillfully, with amazement.

“Do we need to take pictures of the trash too?”

“Since the trash isn’t a budget item, it’s not necessary to report it. But it’s good to upload comparison photos showing how much trash was used. So let’s take pictures.”

“Okay.”

Click. Click.

The two took pictures of the purchased materials, receipt details, and 20 bags of trash with their phones.

“Let’s start working then.”

* * *

Installation Day.

Lee Hyerim was waiting for Kang Lim at the site.

‘Kang Lim said he would arrive by 2 PM in a van, so he should be almost here.’

Lee Hyerim had been watching the workers install the wooden stairs and assemble the transparent acrylic canopy since yesterday.

Although there shouldn’t be any discrepancies because everything was cut using computer designs, Lee Hyerim, being quite meticulous, double-checked the design to ensure it matched the dimensions Kang Lim had advised and checked the finishing details.

‘I don’t know where he found the company, but they seem experienced with outdoor sculptures. How do they install it so quickly?’

Now, all that was left was for the project planner, the star of this artwork, to arrive.

Deciding to admire the canopy designed by Kang Lim while she waited, Lee Hyerim stepped inside.

‘Wow... It’s really beautiful. They’re going to fill this with trash? It’s perfect as it is.’

The roof was an elegant aerodynamic shape. The underside was lightly tinted green, while the top and pillars were transparent.

It was sturdy enough to block rain and snow but still graceful with a moderate thickness.

‘This is on a different level compared to ordinary canopies.’

Good acrylic felt clean and pure, like glass.

There was no doubt that this was a beautiful sculpture by itself.

Lee Hyerim stepped inside the canopy.

They say just blocking the sunlight makes a hot summer day feel cooler, and the shade indeed felt like it lowered the temperature significantly.

‘It blocks the sunlight while not obstructing the performer’s view. The height of the roof is perfectly adjusted. The slightly raised edge at the end of the curve is so beautiful...’

Everything was designed with the people who would be inside in mind.

The more she looked, the more she admired the details.

Moreover, the more curves a piece has, the more expensive the CNC costs. How did Kang Lim manage to stay within budget?

Even though he was a young student, his skills were remarkable.

Lee Hyerim was sure that he must have a regular shop he frequented.

Honk honk!

Just then, a van carrying Kang Lim arrived and stopped.

“I’m here!”

Seeing Kang Lim greet her from the window, Lee Hyerim smiled brightly.

“Welcome! Where’s Yoonki?”

“Hyung is lying down. He’s exhausted. He stayed up for several nights painting.”

“Haha. He must be worn out from picking up trash and painting. You must be tired too, Kang Lim.”

“I’m fine. I made him do most of the work.”

With a laugh, Kang Lim unloaded the bags filled with painted recyclable trash.

They had been painted according to the color ratios Kang Lim had prepared.

For most of the time, Hong Yoonki had been a robot picking up trash and painting it.

“Good luck, Kang Lim! The work looks great. I’ll come to see it with my daughter later when we visit Hongdae!”

“Thank you, Mister.”

Since there weren’t many bags of plastic, they were quickly moved, and the van driver left for his next appointment.

“Ah, is this the piece? Hmm... What to name it.”

Kang Lim pondered over the name tag for the artwork that stood in front of the canopy.

Only his name was written on it for now.

“For now, I left the artwork title blank as you asked, so if you write it with a marker, I’ll later type it out and attach it.”

“Sure. Thank you.”

Lee Hyerim looked curiously at the bags that Kang Lim had moved.

“But the amount of trash seems less than I expected?”

“Well, it was about 20 bags originally. But we compressed and reshaped it using a machine. After all, this is a sculpture, and visual beauty comes first.”

“Ah... I see.”

Hearing this, Lee Hyerim’s heart raced.

To think an even more beautiful piece would be created.

She couldn’t wait to see what was inside those bags.

“I also took before-and-after photos of the volume comparison, and I’ll place them next to the stairs. When the voting period opens on the website, I’ll upload them again.”

“Wow, that sounds great! People will be amazed.”

“That would be nice.”

“But... who should take photos of the completed work? Since it’s going on the website, I think we need to use a good camera. Should I call someone I know?”

“Don’t worry about that. I also have a good photographer.”

Bzzz-

As his phone vibrated, Kang Lim answered with an expression as if he had the whole world.

“Hello.”

A voice as beautiful as the canopy Kang Lim had created came from nearby.

A transparent and clear voice.

“The photographer has arrived~! Look behind you!”

“Wow, you’re already here.”

Turning around, he saw Seoyeon smiling brightly.
