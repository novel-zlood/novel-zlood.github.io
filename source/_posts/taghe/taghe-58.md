## Episode 58: Potential

There was a swing where they followed Seoyeon.

Interestingly, it was the same type as the one installed at the playground.

Kang Lim spoke with a curious expression.

“Who installs something like this at home?”

“Isn’t it cute? We made it because Seohui wouldn’t come home, always playing at the playground when she was little.”

“Haha, that’s funny. Seohui must have been just as lively when she was young.”

The two sat on the swing, enjoying the night air.

Kang Lim felt excited as he got on the swing for the first time in a long while and started kicking his feet.

He remembered how he used to lie on his stomach on the swing and spin around like a screw bar when he was little...

In contrast, Seoyeon spoke with a somewhat calmer expression than the excited Kang Lim.

She looked up at the dark night sky, her expression mirroring it.

“But Seohui wasn’t like she is now when she was little... she was really fragile...”

“Really?”

“Yeah, I always feel sorry for not being able to protect her.”

“Why? Did she get hurt at the playground?”

“No...”

“Then?”

“There was something I failed to do as an unnie.”

“What was that? It seems like Seohui should be the one protecting you.”

“...No.”

Seoyeon dragged her feet on the ground, barely swinging.

Kang Lim sensed that pressing further would not yield any answers.

Seoyeon had these occasional moments of inexplicable melancholy.

But he didn’t want to push her.

She would tell him everything later... once she opened up a bit more.

Kang Lim had observed people’s emotions deeply while observing his mother.

Human emotions are indeed complex.

They want someone to understand them completely, yet want no one to know them at all.

They want to be together, yet also want to be alone.

“Seoyeon, you don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to. We haven’t known each other for that long. Don’t feel pressured to tell me how you’ve lived.”

“...Thank you. But I have something I’m curious about!”

Suddenly, Seoyeon kicked off the ground and soared into the air.

“Why did you start painting Oriental art? Do you like the Korean aesthetic?”

“Well, that’s part of it. But I was just fascinated by the materials. You can just squeeze out paint for Western art, but for Oriental art, you have to prepare the pigments to suit the paper. Learning to use traditional materials was fun.”

“No wonder, it wasn’t just tube paint. I saw it was traditional powdered pigments... what did you study from?”

“I read Professor Kim Soonsik’s papers and slowly followed along. He’s really famous for Oriental art materials science.”

“Did you do that when you were like thirteen?”

“Yeah.”

Seoyeon burst into laughter, finding it absurd.

It was hard to believe it was true.

“By the way, Kang Lim, we need to transport your works as soon as possible. I’ll call a professional transport company, so let me know when you’re free. The works on hanji might get damaged if they catch wind before being mounted.”

“Wow, you know a lot too. The way you talk.”

“Of course, I do!”

Kang Lim smiled at Seoyeon, whose expression had brightened.

“But it’s fine to transport them tomorrow since my mom’s always at home.”

“Oh, really?”

“Yeah, she writes novels. I’ll let her know in advance that someone will come to pick them up.”

“Wow! She writes novels? No wonder you won an award for a children’s book! Must be in your genes.”

“No, I’m not that good at writing.”

“Oh, come on, don’t be modest...”

“Haha.”

“Alright then! I’ll send the transport tomorrow. Once the studio is organized, you can come anytime to use it.”

“Sure, thanks. I think I’ll be able to use it once school classes settle down.”

Seoyeon, imagining the moment Kang Lim debuts at Heyum, spoke.

“I’m really looking forward to the exhibition we’ll create at Heyum! It’ll probably be around the end of the semester, right after Professor Gu Haeyoung’s class ends?”

“Well, yes. I don’t know much about planning, so please help a lot. This is my first time with such a big art gallery. Baekyeon Gallery is big, but Heyum is on another level.”

Seoyeon looked at Kang Lim intently before speaking.

It seemed she was about to say something important.

“Kang Lim, think of me as just your assistant. You’ll be busy with your artwork, so I’ll handle things like catalogs and posters, and I’ll write the foreword and reviews as the curator. But I believe you’re the best at staging your paintings.”

Seoyeon knew that Kang Lim was not someone who would be confined to just a canvas.

She sensed that his potential was so great that he would soon dominate the space.

Heyum might even seem small to him.

“Uh, but I’m not a curator?”

“Think of a famous singer. Those who sing well write better lyrics because they’ve experienced their own voice. They understand their image and song well, so they set the concept well. Some even produce better than producers. Just like how I applied to the practical arts department to better understand artists.”

“Hmm, but I don’t have the experience. I’ve never planned an exhibition.”

“No, you’ll definitely do it better than I would. I’ll only get involved in planning when you have important overlapping exhibition schedules and can’t participate in another exhibition at the same time.”

“...”

“First, I’ll organize your past works chronologically before you come into the studio. Later, take your time to think about the solo exhibition you want to create.”

“Okay, got it.”

Listening to Seoyeon’s words, Kang Lim fell into thought.

How should he fill the vast Heyum art gallery?

What paintings should he hang after presenting the series dedicated to his mother, which feels like his beginning?

In an instant, images of the paintings he had drawn so far flashed through his mind.

His eyes naturally closed.

* * *

The next day, all the students of the Department of Plastic Arts gathered in the auditorium.

The news that Ryu Junhee was coming had everyone excited.

In the piano department, famous pianists come to give master classes to the students.

Similarly, in art, famous artists come to the school to talk about their life and work, and today was that day.

Unlike music, in art, they don’t give advice and teach by looking at individual works.

They just convey what they felt over their long career.

That’s because there are many aspects of painting that can’t be taught by others.

“Hello.”

As Ryu Junhee entered, the students cheered.

A successful alumnus and an expensive artist are always their role models.

Kang Lim was sitting next to Seoyeon, looking at Ryu Junhee.

He felt a bit strange, seeing him more as Seoyeon’s uncle than as a famous painting artist.

Ryu Junhee also looked at Kang Lim as soon as he entered.

Maybe because he knew him or had seen his works, but Kang Lim stood out in a peculiar way.

Especially his clear eyes, which he liked.

Though he didn’t like him sticking close to Seoyeon.

Ryu Junhee alternated looking at Kang Lim and Seoyeon before opening his mouth.

“When I come to give a lecture like this, many professors spend hours talking only about their own work, so I will briefly talk about the key points using someone else’s work. I’ll take questions about my work later.”

The students laughed at Ryu Junhee’s characteristic cocky tone.

“Yes! Sounds great!”

“Cool!”

As the students answered energetically, the presentation screen came down.

On the screen was a sculpture made by attaching photos together.

A Siamese twin human with two heads.

Kang Lim already knew the artist’s work.

“This is a work by artist Kwon Ohsang. The title is <420 Statements on Twins>. I’m not sure if it was actually made by attaching 420 photos, but the idea of making a three-dimensional sculpture from flat photos was shocking. That’s why it became famous. How do you think such an idea comes about? The key point I want to talk about today is how this work was born. Does anyone know?”

Kang Lim raised his hand, feeling a sense of familiarity.

“Yes, Kang Lim, go ahead.”

Kang Lim was a bit surprised that Ryu Junhee already knew his name and face, but he spoke about what he knew.

“I understand that the idea came from the inconvenience of transporting heavy sculptures made of marble or wood, leading to the creation of photo sculptures. The basic framework inside the photos is made of iso-pink, which is light.”

“Correct. So what’s the important point here?”

“The idea came during the process of working.”

When Kang Lim pointed out exactly what he wanted to say, Ryu Junhee flinched.

He didn’t expect it to come out so directly.

Indeed, a student who has worked for a long time is different...

His favorability towards Kang Lim increased a bit more.

“Oh, a knowledgeable student. That’s exactly what I want to emphasize to you guys, to work. Ideas don’t strike like lightning. They often come from changing, modifying, or fixing something uncomfortable. Don’t just doodle idea sketches and esquisses all day. Get into the actual work. You’ll discover a lot there.”

The students, who had always thought of Ryu Junhee as a genius artist who just roams around, looked surprised.

Of course.

Seeing their reactions, Ryu Junhee spoke as if he had expected it.

“I often get misunderstood as someone who just smokes weed and plays around, but in reality, I’m not. I use my studio like an office. I go to my studio every morning to paint, that’s how I feel like my day has started. I hardly ever go a day without holding a brush, except when I take time out for root touch-ups. Because I have to look good.”

While the students laughed at Ryu Junhee’s added joke, Kang Lim understood there was a deeper meaning to his words.

Ryu Junhee was warning against the media-created image of a genius artist who becomes famous overnight.

In reality, famous artists are very diligent and follow a set routine.

“Of course, it’s good to package it as if you didn’t make much effort. Work hard inside but act like you didn’t do anything outside. Just pretend you did it effortlessly. Because many people want something special from artists. Like how the story of Jang Seung-up, the greatest painter of the late Joseon dynasty, is popular because he painted amazing works when drunk.”

While the students laughed again, Ryu Junhee looked at Kang Lim with a serious expression.

Having a special ability itself already gives an aura of mystery that people desire.

How many artists act to seem unique?

He had lived a life so genuine that no such act was needed. When the media spotlighted him, it was clear he would become much more famous than himself.

* * *

As soon as the seminar ended, Ryu Junhee quickly headed to Gu Haeyoung’s professor’s office.

“Hello, Professor. It’s been a long time.”

“Yes, it’s good to have you here. Let’s have a meal with Gerald.”

Gu Haeyoung warmly welcomed Ryu Junhee, who had come after a long time.

Welcoming a grown-up graduate is always a joy for a professor.

“No, I have something urgent to tell you. It’s important.”

Gu Haeyoung looked puzzled at the unusually serious Ryu Junhee, who usually had a relaxed demeanor.

He seemed deep in thought.

“Sure, what is it?”

“Just a moment.”

Ryu Junhee checked his phone, counting the seconds.

He was waiting for the time when the article he had preemptively leaked to the media would be published after Kim Seonbong’s scandalous articles were blocked.

At exactly 11 o’clock, he refreshed the portal site’s news page, and the article popped up.

Showing the article, Ryu Junhee spoke.

“Look at this. This is the artist who will be participating with me in the Venice Biennale next year. I’m planning to bring him down by exposing more articles.”

“...”

“He should have been expelled a long time ago, but there are people within the planning team who just want to smooth things over by blocking the articles, probably because dealing with a planned exhibition’s disruption is bothersome. I couldn’t stand the nonsense of separating the artist’s personal life from their art.”

“I see, that happened.”

“Especially since Kim Seonbong is an Oriental painter who reinterprets the four gentlemen in a modern way, it’s even more absurd. How can someone who paints the spirit of a gentleman commit sex crimes?”

Gu Haeyoung sighed as she read the article detailing Kim Seonbong’s scandal.

Does power change a person, or were they always like this?

There were so many professors who abused their positions, tarnishing the entire art world.

“So, the conclusion is that Kim Seonbong will be expelled from the group exhibition, leaving a vacancy at next year’s Biennale.”

“That’s right.”

“Professor, recommend Kang Lim. Only your direct presentation can persuade them. We can build his career at our art gallery.”

“That’s what you came to say.”

“Yes, I like his work. I want to participate with him this time.”

Gu Haeyoung liked the look in Ryu Junhee’s eyes.

Finding a worthy competitor like this helps avoid falling into a creative rut and leads to growth.

“Actually, Kang Lim might be able to do it even without Heyum’s career.”

“...What do you mean?”

“I want a masterpiece. If Kang Lim creates such a work, I will immediately prepare the presentation.”

Every artist has a signature masterpiece.

Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam, Picasso’s Guernica, Rodin’s The Gates of Hell...

Gu Haeyoung wanted a work that would immediately come to mind when Kang Lim’s name was mentioned.

A work so magnificent that it would overshadow all the paintings he had done so far, standing out as a single image.

A masterpiece that would leave no room for disagreement.

“That’s a masterpiece.”

“In the afternoon, I have a class. If you’re curious about what assignment I’ll give, feel free to observe. I plan to draw out all his potential.”

Ryu Junhee had never seen such a confident expression on Gu Haeyoung before.

He felt chills on his neck and arms.

He couldn’t even begin to predict what kind of work she wanted.
