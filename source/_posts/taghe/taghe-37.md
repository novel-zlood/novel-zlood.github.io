## Episode 37: The Surprise Date

After the performance, Kang Lim went to Sung Woojin.

“Thank you for the wonderful song today. Actually, I’m a fan.”

Since Kang Lim liked the cool electronic sound of the band’s music, it was natural that he was a fan of Sung Woojin.

‘The band itself was good, but Sung Woojin’s unique sentiment was perfect.’

The lyrics he wrote were a great comfort to Kang Lim, who worked in a company.

His voice was so attractive that it made Kang Lim buy the entire album and listen to every track, even the acoustic versions.

“No… I’m really the one who should be grateful. It’s my first time being in the spotlight like this, it feels like I’ve debuted.”

“Haha. You’ll become very famous. Don’t worry.”

Knowing Sung Woojin’s future, Kang Lim casually said the words.

He was just stating a fact.

But Sung Woojin seemed moved by the words and said with a slightly choked expression.

“Thank you so much...”

Everyone has a period of obscurity before they spread their wings.

And they always remember those who helped them during that time.

When Sung Woojin started to sob, Kang Lim smiled and gifted him a drawing he made during the performance.

“You were completely one with the song. I drew this then.”

Sung Woojin took the drawing and eventually let out tears.

He was still a young student with a tender heart.

In fact, Sung Woojin was very poor, to the extent that he couldn’t even finish high school.

It later became known that he sang in a school uniform because of that regret.

“Thank you so much, hyung. I won’t forget this kindness.”

“What kindness?”

Sung Woojin, who was shaking with emotion, quickly wiped his tears off the drawing.

“This is really amazing.”

The drawing contained all the emotions felt just moments before.

The cheers and applause of many people.

The thrill of sending out his voice through all that.

The ecstasy of being in a trance, to the point where it was sad that the music was ending.

“How can you express all this with just a pencil? It feels so realistic.”

“I just drew it quickly.”

Sung Woojin burst out laughing at Kang Lim’s cool tone.

“Crying and then laughing…”

“…”

Stopping his laughter at Kang Lim’s joke, Sung Woojin handed over his phone.

“Can you give me your number, hyung? I want to work with you when I release an album later.”

Huh? What a jackpot.

Kang Lim quickly took Sung Woojin’s phone.

This was a chance to become a successful fan.

“Wow, I’d be thankful.”

“You can speak casually.”

“Okay!”

From afar, Seoyeon was watching the two with a smile.

‘He says he’s a fan, but he’s grinning from ear to ear. Now he looks his age.’

* * *

Seoyeon and Kang Lim moved toward Sangsu Station.

They had agreed to go to a famous restaurant in exchange for Seoyeon taking photos.

Seoyeon was someone who had many things she wanted to do and eat.

She wasn’t someone who had lived abroad… Who knew she liked Hongdae this much.

Kang Lim looked at Seoyeon with curious eyes.

‘Well… She had a specific menu in mind when we first met too.’

Walking in step with Seoyeon, Kang Lim thought of the Coffee Fragrance Attic.

It was so vivid, like it had happened yesterday, even though it was the first day of class.

Smiling, Kang Lim took the camera Seoyeon was holding.

“Isn’t it heavy? Let me carry it.”

Seoyeon, whose shoulder suddenly felt lighter, looked around in surprise.

“Huh, it’s fine.”

“Wow, it’s actually heavier than I thought.”

Well, it was heavy since she brought multiple lenses just in case…

He should have carried it earlier.

He had never held such an expensive camera before, so he didn’t realize it was this heavy.

What a fool I am.

Kang Lim felt like hitting himself.

“Do we really have to go this way? We might see some disgusting artwork.”

Kang Lim was worried about the last part of the street he wanted to walk on.

Sensational Agency’s artwork was bound to be disgusting.

Just as Kang Lim feared…

After walking a bit further, Seoyeon stopped, spotting a strange shape in the distance.

Judging by her squinting eyes in disbelief, it was clearly Sensational’s work.

Kang Lim also squinted and looked.

If she could see it from here, Seoyeon must have good eyesight.

“Can you see it from here? Are you an eagle?”

“Let’s turn back.”

“I thought you’d say that...”

Seoyeon decisively turned around.

It was a piece she absolutely did not want to see up close.

* * *

The tteokbokki restaurant had a cute atmosphere similar to the Coffee Fragrance Attic.

Notes from visitors were attached here and there, and there were many figures.

All the famous animation characters were gathered.

Seoyeon’s eyes sparkled as she opened the menu.

She took a photo with her phone, saying even the menu writing was cute.

“How tasty must it be for them to name it ‘Must Come Back Tteokbokki’?”

Whether customers must come back or not, the restaurant’s name suggested so.

“Still, why tteokbokki? Let’s eat something expensive.”

Kang Lim chuckled as he watched Seoyeon choose from the menu.

He wanted to treat her to something nice since it had been a while and he had received her help. He felt a bit guilty for only offering tteokbokki.

“There were reviews saying you must try it if you come here. And there are many other places to go after this. You didn’t think we’d only come to one place, did you?”

“Oh…? Is it possible to eat more after this?”

“Of course! First, we must order the butter-drenched potatoes, they’re a must-try.”

“There are a lot of must-try items.”

“Right, and since I like meat, let’s order the beef brisket tteokbokki as the base. And finish with flying fish roe cheese fried rice.”

“Wow…”

Seoyeon quickly decided on the menu and handed over the order.

Her swift actions were so amusing that it made Kang Lim laugh.

Seoyeon handed an apron to Kang Lim and asked.

“What are you laughing at? You’re wearing white, so put this on.”

“Thanks.”

Then he furrowed his brows and spoke again.

“But what’s with that artwork we saw earlier… Why do they make such things? There are many restaurants nearby… Isn’t it a nuisance?”

“I think so too. But they’re the team that wins every year.”

“What? Really? That’s crazy! Isn’t 50% of the vote from citizens?”

Seoyeon’s reaction was the same as when Kang Lim had discussed it with Hong Yoonki and Lee Hyerim.

‘Well, I couldn’t believe it at first either...’

Kang Lim sighed and answered.

“It seems to be a form where you log in to the website to vote. But honestly, it’s not well-publicized, so who visits the Mapo-gu website? It seems like only those with unique tastes who liked the controversial artworks voted. There’s no dislike button, only a like button, so it doesn’t reflect accurate opinions.”

“…Wow, so they deliberately made it like that for the controversy?”

“Exactly.”

“Wow, that’s annoying… So, even if you make something really good, you could lose unfairly. That’s absurd. You can’t even compare them.”

Seoyeon looked more upset than Kang Lim.

Fortunately, the server brought the tteokbokki on a burner, which slightly softened her expression.

“It’s already cooked, so you can eat it slowly, but it’s better to start with the chewy noodles.”

“Yes, thank you.”

Kang Lim scooped a portion for Seoyeon.

Seoyeon smiled brightly and wrapped beef brisket around the steaming tteokbokki.

Watching her chew like a rabbit was adorable.

Though she preferred meat over lettuce, she still resembled a rabbit...

Kang Lim asked, looking at Seoyeon fondly.

“Is it good?”

“Yeah, it’s spicy yet sweet. You should try it too.”

“Just watching you eat makes me full.”

“Ugh.”

Seoyeon narrowed her eyes and put down her chopsticks.

“Then don’t eat at all.”

“No, I was joking. Thinking about it, I’m hungry.”

Seoyeon chuckled and said.

“You always act cheesy but never stay in touch.”

“Me?”

“Yes, it’s been over a month since the vacation started. You only call when you need something.”

Damn, I thought contacting her casually would be burdensome.

I thought it was natural to call only when needed.

Turns out, it wasn’t.

Kang Lim felt enlightened by the new fact.

“Wow, then I can call you even without a reason.”

“Of course.”

“Really? Then let’s go to the art museum this Saturday.”

“…You really only know art, don’t you?”

“It doesn’t have to be an art museum. Anything is fine.”

Seoyeon almost spat out water, finding Kang Lim’s desperate response amusing.

Barely holding back her laughter, she spoke.

“But I can’t this Saturday.”

“Why?”

“I’m going shopping with my mom.”

“Ah. That’s fine. Then Sunday!”

“Sunday’s not good either.”

“Why?”

“I’m going shopping with my mom.”

“Then any weekday next week!”

“Still shopping.”

“Then the week after…”

“Still shopping.”

“…What?”

“Shopping for a month.”

“...”

Up and down.

It felt like being on a rollercoaster.

This time, Kang Lim narrowed his eyes.

Realizing what she meant, he replied.

“Alright, I get it...”

“I really do have shopping.”

“Sure, that’s some grand shopping you’re doing… What are you buying that takes a month?”

“Um, various things… But it’s true.”

Seeing Kang Lim quickly lose energy, Seoyeon felt a bit sorry.

Feeling guilty, she shouted.

“Today’s exhibition was a great success! Let’s be happy!”

“Hahaha…”

Kang Lim’s eyes were crying, but his mouth was smiling.

* * *

It was already late evening.

Although it was summer and the days were long, it felt like the sun set unusually quickly today.

If it wasn’t for following Seoyeon, Kang Lim wouldn’t have known there were so many unique cafes in Hongdae.

It was so fun that he wanted to forget and play again.

A cool summer night.

The two entered a convenience store.

Seoyeon wanted to drink beer.

“Aren’t you full? Drinking this will make you fuller.”

“You should have some drinks before shopping.”

“…?”

What does she mean by shopping? Is it a metaphor for something?

Kang Lim pondered but couldn’t figure it out.

“You know how to drink?”

“I had some at the freshman welcome party. If you know well, recommend something.”

“Try this. Girls usually like it.”

“Girls?”

Oh, I made a mistake, thinking about what my female classmates used to drink.

Holding a green bottle with lime on it, Kang Lim said.

“No, I meant guys like it. I’m going to drink it.”

Seoyeon chuckled and picked a black beer.

“Really? Then I’ll have this. It looks strong.”

“That’s a dark beer… It might not taste good. Not ideal for beginners.”

“Who cares? I’ll try it.”

They paid for the beer and returned to the sculpture.

The cool night breeze brushed their cheeks, and taking a sip of beer felt like a perfect end to the day.

The fizzy carbonation popping in their mouths was perfect.

“Ah, lager is the best in summer.”

“This is smooth. Not bad.”

Seoyeon laughed with dark beer foam on her lips.

Seeing the white mustache on Seoyeon, Kang Lim laughed but thought it suited her and left it.

However, Seoyeon suddenly stopped laughing and frowned.

“What is that person doing?”

Seoyeon pointed to a woman near Kang Lim’s sculpture.

The woman in a neat semi-formal suit was setting up a sign in front of the sculpture.

Kang Lim, finding the woman suspicious, approached her.

“Excuse me, what are you doing? You can’t set up anything in front of our work.”

The woman smiled and replied.

“I’m an official from the Seoul City Support Project. This year, we’re including on-site voting.”

…!

Hearing this, Kang Lim and Seoyeon looked at each other simultaneously.

They had the same thought in their eyes.

We won.
