## Episode 118: Double Life

The office was filled with the fragrant scent of black tea.

Carter leaned against the back of the sofa and stared at Frazer.

Usually, after the crank-in, there should be deep wrinkles between the eyebrows, but not this time.

The young man who smoothed out the wrinkles of the sensitive old man was more impressive than expected.

"As you said, he's really something."

At Carter's words, Frazer chuckled. He habitually fiddled with a cube as he spoke.

"Why, do you want to raid Kang Lim's studio and sweep up his works? I was planning to do that once the film shoot is over anyway."

"Haha. No, not to that extent. Do you think my judgment is that poor?"

"What? When did you say you liked it?"

Frazer's eyebrows raised. He didn't like the arrogant tilt of Carter's chin.

"Of course, Kang Lim's imagination and expression were astonishing. If Degas had come back to life, he would have painted just like that. But it's not to my taste."

"What's your taste then? Work that smells? You usually like pieces that can rot."

"This guy really says whatever he wants."

"But it's true, isn't it?"

Frazer shook his head at Carter. The short sports haircut and the bushy beard were becoming increasingly annoying. Was it just his imagination, or did Carter seem more and more like a homo?

"Why do you always like controversial works? It was the same when you bought Damien Hirst's piece. It was about cutting up animals and soaking them in formaldehyde, right?"

"It's an idea to express death."

"Well, it's all about how you frame it."

"Haha. Actually, I'm not a big fan of Damien Hirst either. He was better at marketing than his art. I bought it because I liked his star quality."

"You sound like you're talking about celebrities."

Carter nodded at Frazer. His golden eyes sparkled.

"That's right, celebrities! Artists are the same. You've seen a lot of actors, so you know better. There's a certain charm that stands out. I'm talking about innate star quality."

"The R.F you're paying attention to, is he that type too?"

"Yes, he definitely has star quality. I like how he's trying to shake the world. He tackled Da Vinci as soon as he came out, didn't he? The concept of being shrouded in mystery is also excellent."

"His actions at the auction were quite interesting. To express racial discrimination in that way."

Carter snatched the cube Frazer had been fiddling with and solved it in an instant.

"Setting the stage well is crucial. That was Damien Hirst's talent. He gathered people who would have been treated as attention seekers and showcased them in exhibitions. Eccentrics gathered and became unique, and they became artists. Creating events to draw attention, that's planning."

"I don't want to call that art. There's nothing impressive about today's so-called geniuses."

"As I said earlier, I don't think Damien Hirst is a genius either. He just gathers quirky people."

"Then what do you gain from it?"

"Usually, geniuses do things that their generation can't understand. If you gather noticeable eccentrics, won't you catch a true genius or two? That's how the impressionist masters you admire were too."

Carter gave Frazer a sly smile. It was a look he could never get used to.

"You're spouting nonsense. It's a pity you can't even make that distinction."

"Haha. What can a film snob of the seventh art know?"

Frazer recalled his childhood. He had vowed never to grow old like Carter.

"...The art I envision is not like that."

"You're starting to babble senilely! Are you bringing up your hungry days again?"

"I can't help it. All the thoughts I jotted down back then are being made into films now."

"Despair is a good material!"

"I always strive not to be ashamed of my adult self in front of my younger self. To properly implement that thought, I have to maintain purity..."

Carter adjusted his posture in response to Frazer's earnest attitude. Continuing to joke would drag the conversation on.

"True artists are fools. Everyone asks them why they do something that doesn't make any money. They don't belong to the world. They're defective parts that can't function as components in the machine of the world. They're like cogs that came out wrong."

"That's a sad story. Not the kind of artists I'm looking for."

"Carter, it's not a sad story."

Frazer grabbed Carter's shoulder firmly. His deep brown eyes pierced through Carter's transparent golden ones.

"Because they're outside the world, they can see the whole world."

"......"

"Only from the outside can you look inside."

Frazer's voice resonated in Carter's ears. It was a sound with a large amplitude.

He took a sip of tea and spoke again.

"Artists observe people from a distance. They ask whether the world should run this way on behalf of those busy with their lives."

Just as all studies are based on humanities, so is art. In the end, it's about understanding people and the world we live in.

Frazer saw potential in Kang Lim in this regard. He wasn't just a unique and expressive painter.

"Kang Lim is an excellent artist in that sense. He fully understands the characters living in the world I've created. It's chilling to the core... He reads the psychology of the characters and understands the narrative structure."

Carter sighed and said.

"So, what's your advice?"

"The artists you support have all forgotten their time outside. Don't take away the artists' time for reflection too early. There's no need to rush them onto your money cushion."

"Come on... If their work changes once they enter the world, that means they were only at that level from the start. I'm not looking for saints, so let's drop this."

Carter couldn't understand it either. Why were artists born so weak?

Asking them why they do art was meaningless. They would just attach significance to even a falling leaf.

All the artists Carter had met were strange.

They were so sensitive that they constantly flinched as if a blade were touching their skin.

They thought that people wouldn't understand them, but they wanted to be understood.

And if they couldn't be, they often easily died.

Despite being so fragile, it was fascinating how they persevered and kept challenging communication.

In this clogged-up world... what were they shouting out all alone?

Is that why art is called great?

Carter shook his head vigorously, feeling dizzy.

"A genius who dies young makes the price skyrocket. It's not my fault; I just gave them a chance."

Frazer looked at Carter. It wasn't the first time he had uttered those self-defensive words.

The burden of the crown was something he couldn't bear either.

"Anyway, Carter, as you said, the world needs crazy people. In the end, when there are enough of those crazy people, others will realize that they are the ones who are crazy."

"Ah, my head hurts! Stop babbling and look at this."

Carter pulled out a clipped article from his pocket and handed it over.

It had the address of the gallery where R.F's solo exhibition was being held.

"If you're shooting a movie, you should visit art galleries regularly. You might come up with a good composition. It's nearby, so take a look."

"Hmm... I guess I should go with Charlotte to get some fresh air."

Frazer glanced at the article and chuckled.

"He's showcasing a series he started painting at six years old... As you said, R.F has star quality. He has everything people like."

The next day, Kang Lim returned to his dorm and checked the fabric files sent by Kim Jinseok.

He had kindly sent various samples via international shipping. As expected, the editor was the best.

'Since the snake's skin will cover it, it should be wide rather than too small and dense. Not as big as an anaconda... maybe a large python?'

Kang Lim closed his eyes and felt each piece of leather.

All the animal fur was synthetic, but the textures were all different.

'The rabbit fur is much softer. It needs to be distinctly different from the stiff skunk fur, so I'll go with the one on the left.'

It was enjoyable to touch various fabrics like nylon, leather, and silk used in the scene where Dolly designs clothes.

He thought that children might become interested in studying textiles through this book.

'I hope everyone likes it as much as Eerlin did.'

After meticulously checking everything, Kang Lim sent a reply.

Shortly after, a read receipt appeared, and the phone rang. Kim Jinseok was a quick worker.

"Yes, I checked the fabrics and sent them!"

Kang Lim answered the phone energetically.

[Thank you for checking. I went around several factories to pick the best fabrics.]

"As expected, it's a perfect kit. I just need to send it for tailoring."

[Yes, I think the publication will be after April. I'll contact you again when the Bologna Children's Book Fair opens. You know you have to visit the booth, right?]

"Oh, of course. I'd love to see it too."

[If you win an award in the competition, you'll become more famous as a children's book author. You might be surprised, thinking, 'Oh, I'm making all this money from books?']

"Haha, more than the money, I'm excited that more children will get to see it if it's translated."

[Hehe, that's true. It's satisfying. Korean children will like it too. No, even adults will buy your work.]

"Yes, thank you. I'll see you then! Stay healthy."

[Yes, good luck with the exhibition too!]

Kim Jinseok's last words coincidentally hit the mark.

He realized that his first solo exhibition was starting today.

Kang Lim opened his email and rechecked the materials Seoyeon had sent.

The Seine Gallery had the same lighting as the Baekyeon Gallery and was divided into a U-shaped layout.

'Having a dedicated curator is a blessing. They take care of everything when you're busy...'

Seoyeon had finished the display and sent a selfie with the gallery director, Ines.

The two smiling faces looked good together. It brought a smile to his lips as well.

Ines was someone he met at the Venice Biennale planning team with Ha Baekyeon.

True to someone who maintained relationships since then, she had a good personality and was well-connected. She had many friends in the press, so the exhibition promotion was swift.

Kang Lim liked Ines's thoughtful actions and gentle tone.

She had said that the wallpaper for Kang Lim's first solo exhibition was black, and the concept for the second was a black hole, making it deeply memorable for people.

'Maybe it's because I captured my gloomy period... It ended up like that. I must thank the director separately. I should help with the teardown.'

As he was thinking this, his phone vibrated.

It was a message from Charlotte.

[Charlotte: Kang Lim-ssi, we're having an art team dinner tomorrow night. Would you like to join us? After dinner, Frazer and I plan to visit an exhibition. It's the famous R.F exhibition. I'd love for you to come. It's at the Seine Gallery near Montmartre. I'll send you the address and a map! (photo)]

'What on earth...?'

Kang Lim tilted his head. It was awkward to refuse as a junior staff member who had joined late.

As he was feeling a bit bewildered, another mischievous message arrived.

[Martin: (photo) Hey, Kang Lim-ssi. What's all this? Let's meet up immediately.]

The photo showed a sketchbook filled with the floor plans Kang Lim had meticulously drawn, which he hadn't managed to retrieve after yesterday's shoot.

He had last seen Martin holding it... Why hadn't he returned it and kept it instead?

In the photo sent by Martin, the sketchbook was packed with detailed floor plans drawn by Kang Lim.
