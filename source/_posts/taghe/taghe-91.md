## Episode 91: Explosion

Seoyeon adjusted the sheet horizontally against the exhibition wall.

These were words explaining the artwork, a newly added feature this time.

---

<Circulation Spectrum> Performance.

"Each piece is a living entity with infinite possibilities."

This work, which reminds us that humans are part of nature, will be held again on the last Sunday of May, June, and July.

Two TVs were installed at the entrance of the exhibition hall.

One was playing Kang Lim's performance filmed during the opening, and the other showed the gradually changing exhibition hall view.

Visitors would always stop in front of the videos after viewing the exhibition.

It was too impressive to just leave.

"Oh my, it must have looked like this at the beginning. It's a painting we didn't see."

"Ha... I feel like we need to come back in 3 weeks."

"Yes, I only watch really interesting movies once. I don't like watching things I already know. But since this keeps changing, I have to come back."

"Ugh, I liked what I saw today, so I want to see it again, but it's a shame."

"Things are beautiful because they are missed. You leave when the applause is loudest."

"Puhaha."

The person who joked around noticed the new letters Seoyeon had pasted.

"Huh? It says there's another performance? Should we watch it at that time?"

"Oh, really? Then let's come again at that time."

"Looks like we'll be coming all the time..."

Seoyeon nodded to the visitors leaving the exhibition hall.

Seeing their happy faces made her feel proud.

After everyone left, she took a picture of the wall with the letters and reported it to two people.

Her mother hadn't read it yet, but Kang Lim responded immediately.

[Kang Lim: Good job.]

[Seoyeon: You're the one doing the hard work. You don't have to do another performance.]

[Kang Lim: It's better to do it.]

[Seoyeon: You can ignore the meeting agenda if it's too hard. Don't push yourself next time.]

As the opening performance video went viral on SNS, those who missed it expressed their regret.

Because of this, there was a meeting at Heyum to discuss holding an event, and Kang Lim decided to do it again.

[Kang Lim: It doesn't take much time. It's fine.]

[Seoyeon: If you're okay, that's good... Did you see all the paintings I saved?]

[Seoyeon: Yeah, they're amazing! Shin Hansoo's nose will disappear.]

[Kang Lim: You seem excited, haha.]

[Seoyeon: Of course, it's been a while since Heyum could stand confidently in front of Shin Hansoo! And the artworks have been transported, so don't be surprised if they're missing.]

[Kang Lim: Wow, so theyâ€™ve already flown away?]

[Seoyeon: Yes, you just need to come. But I haven't seen you at the residency lately?]

[Kang Lim: I've been at home working on computer stuff.]

What is he planning... Even if I ask, he won't tell me, right?

Seoyeon imagined Kang Lim's playful expression.

She was sure he'd say it's a secret just to tease her.

[Seoyeon: I won't ask. It'll probably be on the internet later anyway.]

[Kang Lim: Haha, I'll work hard.]

* * *

Kang Lim created several design drafts.

Out of them, he finalized just two.

"Ah... This is unexpectedly tough."

The album jacket cover had to be a perfect square.

Squares are rarely used by artists unless with a special intention, as their symmetrical proportion often results in a static composition.

Absolute artists, who prefer to exclude formative elements, mainly used them.

For the free-spirited Kang Lim, it was quite a restrictive task.

"Other illustrators and I have all centered the title logo."

Except for emotional ballads, most titles were boldly placed in the center.

It's natural. Unlike paintings, design needs to be intuitively visible.

Rather than scattering letters randomly, it's better to neatly align them and design the font stylishly.

The eye is more comfortable with a fixed center of gravity.

"Ugh... What if they don't like it after all my big talk?"

For the first draft, he drew a wolf.

'Question' is a song with a dreamy electronic sound.

The cover was inspired by the image of a howling wolf.

Although it was a Photoshop work, he used a pastel effect to give it a dreamy atmosphere.

The warm colors and the subtle spread of powder were felt in the painting.

"This matches the song's mood, but it doesn't capture Atomic's explosive band image... It just feels sad from the breakup."

[Shocking band! New band! Explosive image!]

The words of Atomic's members echoed in his head.

Kang Lim held his forehead with his hand.

Thinking about it, 'Question' also starts with a dreamy tone and whispering voice... but the chorus amplifies explosively.

The song's structure builds up to a climax.

Especially in the chorus, the husky high notes, as if scratching the throat, are captivating, but the drawing is too soft to capture that.

"Except for the rough wolf fur, it's bland... Let's go with something else."

The second draft was a dandelion.

Dandelions bloom yellow in spring, but after the petals fall, white fluff grows.

A white parachute carrying seeds...

The flower language itself is 'farewell,' matching the music well.

"This has not only the feeling of farewell but also something more."

Kang Lim drew a round dandelion at the bottom left.

Half was yellow petals, and half was white fluff, a cunning look.

The fluff flying diagonally upwards exploded in the air.

As it exploded, fluorescent liquid burst out.

It was a cover drawn using pop art.

"This should fit the title song well and be good for imprinting Atomic's band image. Let's go with this."

Kang Lim reduced the second draft and synthesized it on a phone app screen.

To see how much it stood out.

Most apps used for listening to music have charts.

Choosing music from hundreds of albums, the first page is crucial.

Except for the albums in the Top 10, all are displayed the size of a thumbnail.

The key is to make people click it.

Once clicked, a larger cover half-filling the phone screen appears.

"Damn, when reduced, it doesn't stand out at all. The dandelion isn't even visible."

Trying to fit multiple images into a small square, it didn't pop.

Instead, designs with large title typography stood out.

Of course, some albums matched the concept with multiple images.

A girl group often doing bizarre fantasy concepts had an illustration of a gingerbread house bleeding.

Even a crowded candy village isn't visible when reduced.

"But that's possible because they're famous idols from a big agency. Fans will push them to the top charts... Atomic is unknown."

Most album designs featured the artists.

Nothing catches the eye more than a glamorously adorned celebrity.

"Besides, idol music is so kitschy and bouncy that fluorescent colors are everywhere... Dark colors might stand out more."

Kang Lim sighed at the flamboyantly drawn dandelion bomb.

This isn't it. It looked good alone but not when placed among others.

It's not about the artwork itself.

Album artwork needs to promote.

Just because Kang Lim did it doesn't mean it will become famous.

The illustrator's name only appears when you click and enter the album details.

"This could just get buried. Well, the song is good, so it might climb the charts later..."

Kang Lim hoped the Atomic members would feel it was worth entrusting him.

It would be sad if the album they prepared for months got buried right after release... As a fan, he didn't want to see that.

"What should I make... I'm going crazy."

At that moment, he noticed the gifts piled on his desk.

They were from people during his solo exhibition.

Diffusers, cakes, macarons, hand creams...

Kang Lim grabbed a scented candle and stood up.

"Yeah, the rough touch is best done by hand."

* * *

Korea National University of Arts Woodworking Room.

Kang Lim took out the wood he had stored for woodblock printing.

The lumber was cut against the grain, with prominent growth rings.

[We draw the past in the present, love and hate at the same time. Why do people try to cut any state as if with a knife?]

As he started working, the lyrics of 'Question' came to mind.

The harmonic sound of an electric guitar resonated along the fine grain...

Kang Lim boldly carved along the rhythm.

Gradually, the figure of Sung Woojin holding a mic while singing emerged.

The strong shadows cast by the dim lighting emphasized his features.

Slightly furrowed brows, mouth wide open during high notes.

The square knife roughly carved out the surface, capturing the husky voice.

Simple yet powerful and bold lines.

The hair and skin texture were finely depicted with a small carving knife.

The wriggling lines seemed to vibrate with the sound.

"Hey, here's the ink roller."

As Kang Lim finished his work, Shin Taemin handed him the roller.

He was usually at school painting, but Kang Lim had appeared to borrow a lighter.

Curious about his intentions, Taemin followed him and saw him doing woodblock printing.

"But why did you borrow a lighter for woodblock printing?"

"Ah, you'll see soon."

Kang Lim took out a scented candle and lit it.

He roughly dripped the molten wax onto the carved wood.

The carved wood began to swell back up.

"...What are you doing?"

Shin Taemin raised an eyebrow.

Ink should only be applied to the raised parts to print, but Kang Lim was suddenly pouring wax.

"If you're curious, follow me to the incinerator."

* * *

Shin Taemin gathered leftover wood and failed drawings at the incinerator.

As he piled them up and set them on fire, they burned brightly.

It reminded him of the campfires from elementary school.

"Thanks, my one-day assistant. You're truly my friend."

"...I'm just doing this out of boredom."

"Anyway, you're the only one painting during the holidays? You'll definitely succeed."

Kang Lim grabbed the woodblock with long tongs used for glasswork and heated it over the fire.

As the wax melted away, a smudged ink effect appeared.

"Oh, this is more fun than I thought? It feels like a dreamy melody."

Kang Lim created various burn marks by moving the woodblock up and down.

The transparent yet rich hues were mesmerizing.

"I'll show you something fun before all the wax melts. Step back."

"It's already pretty fun..."

Kang Lim took out a torch and held it in his left hand.

It was a tool used to grill meat, emitting fire.

In his right hand, he held a sprayer filled with oil paint.

Swallowing hard...

As the winter wind blew.

Whoosh-

Kang Lim sprayed oil and fired the torch.

In an instant, flames erupted.

It was literally a bomb, a flamethrower.

"Ahhh!"

As sparks flew everywhere, Shin Taemin screamed and stepped back.

Seeing him overreact was a first for Kang Lim, making him burst out laughing.

"Puhaha. You're such a scaredy-cat."

"...Are you kidding me?"

Shin Taemin glared with disbelief.

Kang Lim was fully geared up with a welding mask and protective suit.

Whoosh-

Whoosh-

As flames burst, black auroras appeared on the woodblock's background.

No, it looked like a wildcat had scratched it.

Parts where he shot intensely were burned through.

"...Who is that?"

Shin Taemin coughed and saw the emerging face through the smoke.

The thick wax had all melted away, leaving only Sung Woojin's face clear.

The unburned parts and roughly carved wood texture were stunningly beautiful.

Kang Lim took off his welding mask and answered proudly.

"He's a singer. This is a band album cover."

"...Looks like he sings hard. Judging by his expression."

"Exactly. He's so handsome that people will click on him in the charts, right? The monochrome will stand out among other albums. It's explosive and unique, perfect for representing Atomic. And adding the pre-designed 'Question' typography on top will be awesome!"

Shin Taemin rubbed his eyes at the overwhelming information.

Already dizzy from Kang Lim's crazy antics, he felt exhausted.

No one else would do album work like this.

"Ah. But this is just the beginning. Farewell isn't just about pain... It also leaves behind preciousness and growth, which I need to express too."

"What are you talking about, you crazy guy..."

Ignoring him, Kang Lim started the next task.
