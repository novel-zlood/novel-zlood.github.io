## Episode 53: Introducing the Artwork

Baekyeon Gallery receives applications from hundreds of artists every year for its competition.

It has become so popular that it is now considered a gateway for young creators.

The media attention is also high, so even established artists with considerable experience apply.

“Ha, there are especially many applicants this year…”

The curator nodded in agreement with the words of Ha Baekyeon, the gallery director.

“Indeed. We have 380 portfolios. We need to select only five from these, which is tough. Perhaps the theme of 'Fragments of Memory' is a bit broad, which is why there are so many applicants. If the theme was something like 'Violence of the Era,' there might have been fewer applicants.”

“But with such clear themes, it’s hard to encounter a diverse group of artists. The scope of expression is too limited.”

“That’s true…”

Since the solo exhibition represents the image of the gallery and lasts for over a month, they were putting extra effort into the evaluations.

Ha Baekyeon patted the curator's shoulder as if to encourage them.

“Hang in there a bit more. There must be a special artist. We’ve already selected two good ones. The video artist and the installation artist from earlier.”

“Ah, right. But I really want to pick a painter, but there aren’t many good paintings. Maybe it’s because the trends in contemporary art have made them rarer…”

Ha Baekyeon, noticing the curator’s disappointment as they sifted through various portfolios, picked up one of the files.

It was a neat black portfolio the size of A3 paper.

Opening the cover, the inside was also black.

‘They must have made the background black to focus on the paintings. I’m a bit excited.’

Upon opening the first page, as usual, the artist's biography and history appeared.

As soon as he saw the date of birth, Ha Baekyeon's eyes widened.

‘What? So young? I’ve never seen a 20-year-old apply for a solo exhibition. They must be very hardworking.’

Checking the school, it was from Hanye University, known humorously as a school for geniuses.

‘The artist debuted in a group exhibition at Insadong Ian Gallery. They’ve also done a lot of illustration work for books and participated in Seoul’s public sculpture projects.’

It was an unusual background.

Artists who experience various genres like this are rare.

Most painters only hold exhibitions.

After confirming the artist's information, Ha Baekyeon turned the first page with anticipation.

‘What…’

The moment he turned the page to look at the painting.

Ha Baekyeon unknowingly covered his mouth in surprise.

A woman lying down by the window.

Her clothes were slightly splashed with rain coming in from outside.

With her last bit of strength, the woman pounded her chest.

It seemed like she wanted to escape the given situation and pressure.

Her desperate eyes made one want to embrace her and pat her back.

Like the sleeves the woman clenched, the background was slightly crumpled and distorted.

The movement showed the emotion as it was, leaving a unique background that seemed to linger.

Even just from the photograph, it was this moving. How would it be in person?

The curator checked the title of the work.

[That Day, Mother]

It was a simple but intriguing title.

Ha Baekyeon checked the title along with the size of the work, the materials, and the year of production.

The unique modified canvas was roughly size 60, and the material was acrylic.

But there was something strange.

‘…What’s with the production year? Is it a mistake? The production year is 14 years ago… This artist is 20 years old, so how is this possible…?’

The curator quickly flipped through the 24 paintings and read the artist’s note at the end.

[Memory is very subjective. Even though I have the ability to recall events from 10 years ago as if they happened just now...]

The curator slowly read the calmly written sentences.

Each word chosen by the artist stuck in his mind.

Although young, the depth of thought made it hard to believe their age.

His throat stiffened, and a sharp pain brushed his heart.

When discovering a great artist.

It was a phantom pain that a curator couldn’t help but feel.

“Found it. A genius rookie.”

* * *

Gerald carefully observed the students, evaluating each of their previous works.

The students seemed quite surprised by his extensive background knowledge and detailed feedback.

When giving assignments, he had loudly told them to draw a lot, which they understood as quantity over quality...

But he was much sharper than they thought.

He hadn’t become a world-renowned artist for no reason.

When serious, he was truly serious.

Under the changed gaze of the professor, the students gradually shrank.

Gerald covered his face with his large hand and spoke.

“Oh, even though you're freshmen, there are so few who are genuinely working on their own pieces! It makes me too sad!”

“…”

When the student who had just been critiqued bowed their head, Gerald felt a bit sorry.

As a professor, he also had to set assignment topics to draw out the students' potential to some extent.

But this time, Gerald decided to leave that task to Gu Haeyoung.

One cannot always create art based on others' themes.

One must find a lifelong subject to study alone.

Art is a solitary endeavor.

Digging deeply into one’s own worldview and continuously expanding it...

He wanted to convey this fact through this lesson.

That they could no longer remain babies.

“But that’s okay! You can start searching from now. We still have three years until graduation, right? You can definitely find a topic you want to work on. Now, next student!”

Next up was Shin Taemin.

Since the architecture student was absent, the turn came much faster.

Shin Taemin seemed a bit uneasy as the students before him had been scolded consecutively.

Especially as he had been losing confidence in his painting lately.

However, Gerald nodded quietly as he looked at Shin Taemin’s painting.

For the first time, he seemed pleased.

“Good, good! Explain it. You have quite a lot of work!”

Shin Taemin stepped forward and explained his painting.

The space was filled with self-portraits he had been drawing for a long time.

“I felt that I was seriously working on my art since high school, and I started drawing self-portraits then. Frida Kahlo, famous for her self-portraits, said, ‘I paint myself because I am so often alone and because I am the subject I know best,’ but I draw myself for the opposite reason. I draw myself because I don’t really know myself.”

The somewhat gloomy expression and voice of Shin Taemin made the female students also look sad.

Gerald was personally confirming Shin Taemin’s innate empathy.

In fact, such painters sell well even if their paintings are not good, but this kid’s paintings were decent.

Shin Taemin continued.

“Well, but I don’t think I’m the only one who feels this way. For example, when people meet after a long time, they say things like, ‘Your face has changed a lot, gained weight, lost weight...’ They say all sorts of things, right? But we, who look in the mirror every day, often don’t notice those changes. Also, many people want to see themselves from another person’s perspective because they are curious about how they look.”

The people around nodded in agreement.

“…Why is it so hard to see oneself clearly? I have been researching that as my subject. And although I have tried various genres through material studies classes, I definitely feel that painting suits me best. When I look at my face drawn on a large canvas, it feels like I can see something inside it.”

Gerald spoke with a warm smile.

“Excellent! I can see the potential to delve deeper into the human inner self with that subject! I just hope you keep up the good work. Your painting skills are already good enough.”

When Shin Taemin looked surprised by the unexpected praise, Gerald burst into laughter.

“Hahaha. You seem bewildered. But well done! Artists who left many self-portraits include Frida Kahlo, Van Gogh, and Rembrandt. These were all painted during difficult times. Frida Kahlo painted after a trolley accident broke her spine at 18, leaving her immobile for 20 years. Van Gogh painted during times when he struggled even to sustain his life due to poverty. Rembrandt painted after his wife died of tuberculosis and his family fell into ruin. During these times, masterpieces were created.”

Gerald pointed to Shin Taemin’s painting and spoke.

“The characteristic of self-portraits is that they share the artist's deepest inner self. This goes beyond a simple visual experience. Through the artist’s own testimony that 'I am still alive,' one can find a desperate and moving meaning of existence.”

“Oh…”

The students’ mouths opened in awe at Gerald’s profound interpretation.

“Facing oneself fully is a very difficult task. Humans are much more insignificant than they think. But because of that, it’s a courageous act that leaves an impression on the audience. Just, while creating, you might find it hard, so often play with friends and share artistic inspirations together. Great presentation!”

As Gerald left the spot, the students moved in a rush again.

This time, it was Lee Sora’s partition.

“Oh, yours is good too. Now we have some worth-seeing works! Explain.”

Lee Sora, like Yoon Jangmi, was an older student who re-entered Hanye University after graduating from another college.

She was a student who painted diligently as she had clearly set her career path.

Lee Sora stood in front of her work and spoke.

“I’ve always liked scribbling, so I started drawing. I’m happiest when I depict everyday life.”

Lee Sora painted scenes that could be easily seen around with warm and comfortable colors.

People looking at their phones or listening to music in the subway.

Students drawing in the studio.

Cats sharing food on the street.

Literally, scenes one might encounter in life.

Her depiction skills were quite detailed, making many people look closely.

Lee Sora pointed to her drawings and said.

“I draw all the landscapes we can see. Like the Impressionist painters, I like drawing scenes you can commonly encounter on the streets. I want to give people a sense of stability and make them feel healed. I want it to be comforting and beautiful at first glance.”

The moment she said that, Gerald’s initially pleased expression turned rapidly dark.

“Are you kidding me?”

With a deeply furrowed brow and a thunderous voice, Lee Sora was startled.

“W-Why?”

Gerald sighed and covered his face.

Even if it’s a practical art department, the basic knowledge is this lacking...

“I don’t think art always needs to be serious. Pursuing just beautiful form can also make great art. But! Your example is wrong! Why are you bringing up the Impressionists and boasting about your empty-headedness!”

“…What?”

“Sure, if you were a painter who experienced the 1st and 2nd World Wars, you might criticize the Impressionists’ paintings as merely beautiful works. But you’re a 21st-century person, aren’t you?”

“…I don’t understand what you mean.”

“The time when the Impressionists were active was when painters debuted through the 'Salon' competition in Paris. During the reign of Napoleon III, paintings that exalted French authority were popular. The content of the paintings was all about historical heroism or mythological scenes from the Bible.

The Impressionists, as you said, painted ordinary scenes and were ridiculed and even seen as anti-government figures at the time. In other words, they were hipsters.”

“…”

“Back then, painting ordinary scenes became a significant subject that challenged authority! It was a struggle for the freedom to paint what they wanted. That’s why their works are worth billions now. Their paintings don’t just end with being pretty. It’s the complete opposite of what you said!”

“…Then what should I say?”

“You should study and figure that out! Do I have to decide for you?”

Watching Lee Sora’s face turn bright red, Gerald shook his head.

“A painter should not let their stupidity show in their words. Otherwise, they’ll be ignored by the hyenas of the art world, and their exhibition halls will be empty. Critics will gleefully tear you apart. World-renowned artists study art history and the history of the times as deeply as curators. You need to know the flow of the times well!”

It was true.

There were always opportunities for artists to explain their works.

If ignorance was revealed during an interview or incorrect facts were listed in an artist’s note, no one would seek them out.

Good work is a given, and they must also speak well.

“Next person!”

Gerald was eager to hear Kang Lim’s story.
