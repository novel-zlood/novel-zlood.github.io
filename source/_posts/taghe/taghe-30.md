## Episode 30: Pilseung Agency

It's been two weeks since the end of the semester.

'College vacations are really long and nice...'

Kang Lim looked out the bus window, trying to enjoy the cool summer breeze... but it was too hot, so he closed it.

'No, I shouldn't open the window when there's air conditioning...'

South Korea is a really good country. There are hardly any places as cool and well-facilitated as this.

Whether it's a café, a bus, or a bank, the air conditioning is so strong that it's almost cold.

However, once you get off, you're met with the scorching heat that makes the road shimmer, so adjusting to the temperature is urgent.

Kang Lim opened his phone and accessed the Han Ye University class net.

He clicked on the grade information tab from the student list.

Course numbers, subject names, credits, and grades appeared in a row.

<Basic Common Practice>, <Materials Science - Printmaking, Sculpture, Western Painting, Crafts>, <Anatomy>, <Art History>... even Shin Hansoo's <Art Discourse and Art Criticism Practice>.

He earned 22 credits and received a perfect GPA of 4.5.

'Wow. This is a really fantastic report card. I used to struggle to maintain about a 3.3...'

He felt good about getting A+ grades from professors known for being tough graders.

In the second semester, the 5-credit common practice will be dropped, and the major classes in formative arts will start in earnest, which made him excited.

'It's nice to see Professor Goo Haeyoung often... I'm really curious about Gerald Moore.'

A world-renowned artist with a completely different personality from Goo Haeyoung.

You can easily find interviews with Gerald Moore on various art museum websites.

Thinking of Gerald Moore's hearty laughter and bright face, Kang Lim pressed the disembark button. It was in front of the main gate of Hongik University.

Bzzzz-

As the door opened, the hot air hit his face.

"Wow. It really comes in strong."

July and August are indeed the hottest months of summer.

You can tell by the way people standing at the crosswalks frown under the strong sunlight.

As he passed the main gate and went into a narrow alley, it became a bit cooler thanks to the shade.

He could see murals painted by Hongik University students.

From alphabets designed with fancy typography to cute characters.

Kang Lim walked slowly along the stone wall and stopped at a café.

It was a café that sparkled particularly brightly in the sunlight, thanks to its white marble.

"One iced Americano, please."

"Yes~, I'll bring it to you."

Oh. They bring it to you instead of using a pager. Maybe it's because the coffee is 6,000 won...

Kang Lim thought that the service charge was included and went up to the outdoor terrace.

Given the elaborate Bali-like interior, he decided to just accept it.

The rent for opening a café here must be astronomical...

As soon as he went up the stairs, he looked around.

Today was the day he was meeting people introduced by Professor Han Jungpil.

As he didn't know their faces, he thought he should contact them again. Just as he opened his phone...

"Hey! Alligator group! Over here."

A woman wearing round gold-rimmed glasses waved at Kang Lim.

Next to her was a man with a grass-like hair style similar to Professor Han Jungpil's, also smiling at Kang Lim.

Seeing the two people waving vigorously from a distance...

Kang Lim tilted his head, wondering why they were calling him an alligator group.

And if these were indeed the people he was supposed to meet today, he was curious about how they knew his face.

"...Me?"

"Yes!"

"Are you with Professor Han Jungpil...?"

"That's right! We're from Pilseung Agency."

"Oh, hi."

"Yes. Please have a seat. It must have been hot getting here. What would you like to drink?"

Kang Lim pulled out a chair that seemed to be roughly woven from wood and sat down.

On the table was a half-eaten quiche.

A French dessert filled with whipped cream and minced meat.

"No, I'm fine."

The two people, who seemed to be veterans from working on-site for a long time, looked quite young.

Both appeared to be in their early thirties.

Whatever it was, Kang Lim felt that he was getting opportunities too easily.

Feeling a bit guilty, he added,

"Although I came through an introduction, I'll really do my best."

At his words, the two people with relaxed expressions burst into laughter.

"Kang Lim, these city projects always require at least one exhibition experience. Only already debuted artists are invited. You don't have to be so formal. Didn't you already have an exhibition in Insadong?"

At the woman's explanation, the man next to her suddenly laughed loudly.

His thin lips and narrow eyes curved even more when he laughed, making him look sly.

Professor Han Jungpil had a serious and weighty impression...

Only his grass-like hairstyle was the same as Han Jungpil's.

"It was a group exhibition. I'm also preparing my portfolio during the vacation to apply for solo exhibitions. There are a lot of calls for submissions in the fall."

As he spoke, he suddenly felt strange.

These people seemed to know a lot about him from the start.

Did the professor tell them everything?

Kang Lim looked at them alternately with curiosity.

"But how did you know about my exhibition in Insadong?"

The woman with glasses opened her eyes wide like her round glasses and said,

"Oh my. You must not have seen this."

The man next to her opened a magazine and showed it to Kang Lim.

'Art Magazine K'.

It's a fairly famous art magazine company in Korea.

Unlike 'Tomorrow's Art University,' which features entrance exam paintings, this is a professional art magazine.

However... the article featured a place Kang Lim knew.

It was the Ian Gallery where he had a group exhibition, and his work was prominently displayed in the main hall.

[Good works turn the museum floor into a swamp.]

'Oh, so that's why they called me an alligator group.'

He felt embarrassed by the somewhat provocative headline.

But since it meant his painting was attractive enough to keep people there, Kang Lim took the magazine and slowly read the article.

Having someone leave such a precious review after seeing his painting...

It's only natural to be grateful for that.

[In most art exhibitions, if we can hold a visitor's attention for even 30 seconds, it's considered a successful piece. Many works can't even hold attention for 3 seconds and are quickly passed by. There are many works whose meanings are hard to grasp even when explained.]

'Indeed. Many modern paintings are quite abstract...'

[But last week at the Ian Gallery in Insadong, I had a special experience. On the opening day of the exhibition under the theme 'Great Villains,' there were many people in front of the main painting. It was a strange phenomenon, as if a market crowd had gathered in the museum.]

Kang Lim also recalled that time.

He remembered being pulled through the crowd by the curator.

It was the first time since the entrance ceremony that he had received so much attention.

Moreover, Kang Lim had a good memory, so just thinking about it made him feel like he could hear the murmuring voices of people up close, making the scene more vivid.

[The image of people viewing the painting titled 'The Banality of Evil' is still fresh in my mind. A child holding tightly to their mother's sleeve, seemingly scared. Elders looking at the painting with serious expressions... Even though it didn't depict a brutal scene directly, everyone seemed fearful and couldn't take their eyes off it. The abstract, decayed human figure warned us in an eerie way about what happens when evil gains authority. The entire exhibition hall was filled with a sense of unease and tension.]

As Kang Lim slowly read the article, the woman with glasses pointed out,

"Here, this last part is the most important!"

He read the part the woman pointed to.

[The curator explained the meaning of the painting with meticulous and refined language, but unfortunately, it wasn't necessary. The artist had already communicated through the painting. Just as commentary can be distracting when watching a fantastic figure skating performance, the distance between the audience and the artist had already approached zero. There was no need to reiterate the visual meaning through words. I've never seen such a novice artist before. Especially in a group exhibition. I eagerly await Kang Lim's solo exhibition.]

"You know what happens to the newcomers featured in Art Magazine K, right?"

"Yes. I'm really grateful."

Art Magazine K is known for its editor with a keen eye.

The article 'Rising New Artists' is famous for discovering promising newcomers.

People who buy the magazine always start with this section, curious about who has been featured.

"And I heard that for this issue, they put a lot of effort into the articles to commemorate Nam June Paik's 75th birthday. But for a painting from a group exhibition to be featured... That's unbelievable. Usually, even if you win a solo exhibition contest, it's a dream to get featured if the work lacks quality. Kang Lim, you captivated many people with just one painting."

The woman smiled as she handed a business card to Kang Lim.

The business card had a neat logo, befitting a design agency.

"I'm Lee Hyerim. I graduated from Cranbrook Academy, worked in New York, met Professor Han Jungpil, and have been working with him since. We graduated from the same university, so I'm kind of a distant junior. Haha."

"Right. Nice to meet you. I don't have a business card to give, but I'm Kang Lim."

"You're currently enrolled at Han Ye University, right?"

"Yes, that's correct."

"You're a freshman, right? Really?"

"Yes..."

"Wow..."

Bzzzz-

"Oh. What's this."

As Kang Lim tried to turn off his phone, Lee Hyerim gestured that it wasn't necessary.

He checked his messages. It was someone who had just seen the news, like him.

[Lee Hyunseong: (photo) Hey, Kang Lim, you got featured in Art Magazine K. Your painting is huge. Did you see this?]

[Kang Lim: I just saw it.]

[Lee Hyunseong: Did Shin Taemin see this? It's super amazing. The top artists in Korea were all featured in this newcomer section when they debuted.]

[Shin Taemin: I don't read Korean magazines.]

[Lee Hyunseong: ...Why am I the only one surprised?]

It wasn't a message that needed much attention.

[Lee Hyunseong: Well, he was featured in magazines since high school. Now, unless it's the New York Times or something, I won't be surprised either.]

Kang Lim chuckled and put his phone back in his pocket.

"I'm Hong Yunki. I'm much older than you, so I'll speak comfortably."

This time, the man next to Lee Hyerim extended his hand for a handshake.

"Of course."

"You can just call me hyung."

Hong Yunki also took out a business card from his wallet and handed it to Kang Lim.

"I graduated from Goldsmiths, worked as an assistant under Kim Sanghee, and then joined Professor Han Jungpil. So, I'm perfect for this project. You know what I mean?"

Kim Sanghee is an artist particularly known for outdoor sculptures related to this project.

She mainly creates sculptural works placed in city centers or streets.

These large-scale works are difficult to execute alone, so they usually form a team with assistants.

Hong Yunki looked at Kang Lim with a light smile.

It was a slightly frivolous smile.

"But I'll do my best to reflect your opinions. We absolutely can't lose this time. Every year, the winning team always has a fine arts member. Formative ideas are important. Your work is good, so you'll do well. Feel free to talk about anything. I'll accept all your ideas, whatever they are."

Although his words were supportive, his expression seemed to hold a strange resolve.

"These are the works from the teams that always win."

Hong Yunki handed a blue file folder to Kang Lim.

"Sensation Agency. They win every year. Because of them, the name Pilseung Agency has become a joke."

Kang Lim brushed his chin in disbelief as he turned the pages.

'This is the team that wins every year... Why?'

As he looked through Sensation Agency's works, he had only one thought.

Ah, this group really has a lot of problems...
