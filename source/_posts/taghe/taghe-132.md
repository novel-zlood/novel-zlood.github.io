## Episode 132 Record

Kang Lim put his hand into the jar.

As he touched the rustling paper, he picked one that was folded multiple times.

He had a feeling. This is the one.

When he pulled out the note with a pleased expression, Michelle spoke.

"Please pick two more. We plan to have a performance on the school open day, so we can't have too many groups."

"Oh, is it four people per group?"

"That's right. We hope you create a high-quality piece."

Following Michelle's words, Kang Lim picked out two more notes.

Knowing it was a group of four put him at ease.

Even if there was one odd person, it wouldn't be too difficult to complete the task.

"Once you've picked them all, can you tell me the names? I'll write them on the board."

"Okay. The first one is..."

Kang Lim unfolded the lucky note he had picked first.

On the paper, there were neat letters.

Contrary to the tidy handwriting, it was a free-spirited student's name.

"...Melissa."

As soon as the name Melissa was mentioned, the classroom burst into laughter.

Most reactions were about whether they would even see her face during the assignment.

'She's the student who skipped Alfonso's class saying she was expressing freedom.'

Kang Lim looked around.

As expected, she was nowhere to be seen. Melissa had skipped today too.

'Ah. I really have no luck with draws.'

Melissa always seemed busy, and since their classes didn’t overlap, he had only seen her a few times.

The first time he saw her was in art history class. Back then, it seemed like she had just washed and ran over, as her hair was wet.

'Well, the remaining ones should be fine.'

Kang Lim unfolded the remaining notes one by one.

Whether it was coincidence or fate, familiar names appeared.

"The last two are Baudouin and Shin Taemin."

Upon hearing Kang Lim’s words, Baudouin shouted with joy.

Shin Taemin turned his head towards the window, seemingly displeased with Baudouin.

The other students looked at the two with envy.

If you worked with Kang Lim, you could produce high-quality work.

Michelle thought the same.

"Haha. What an interesting group of four. I'm looking forward to it!"

As Kang Lim returned to his seat, a few randomly selected students came out to pick their notes.

Sighs and cheers erupted here and there.

A moment of mixed emotions.

Indeed, in group projects, it’s crucial whether there are any weak links or not.

"The list is finalized. No changing group members."

Michelle neatly wrote the names of the group members and took a photo for the record.

Watching her, Kang Lim nodded.

These days, with such immediate documentation, it's hard to switch group members.

"There are many wonderful spaces within the school. École des Beaux-Arts itself is living history. Decide where each of you will perform and email it by next week. If it's nearby, external locations are also possible."

At Michelle's words, some students raised their hands and asked questions.

They were groups that usually hung out together and were happy to be in the same group.

"What if the location we choose overlaps with another team?"

"It doesn’t matter. The reason we’re informed in advance is to schedule it. When people visit the open studio, they will watch the performances in order."

What would happen if different performance arts were expressed in the same place?

It would be a clear comparison, and the better one would leave a lasting impression...

While Kang Lim was pondering, Baudouin spoke to him.

"Kang Lim, I’m so glad to be in the same team! Thank you for picking me."

"Likewise, let's do our best."

Baudouin smiled widely at Shin Taemin, who was sitting behind.

"Taemin! It's amazing to do a group project together. Must be the roommate connection."

"Unlucky..."

"Haha. He's pretending again. He likes it."

Baudouin patted Shin Taemin's shoulder and spoke to Kang Lim.

"When he first moved into the dorm, he was so distant."

"When did I?"

"You were. I could feel you keeping your distance, but now we’re quite close."

'He just seems to be ignoring you...'

Kang Lim looked back and forth between Shin Taemin and Baudouin.

Well, since they live together, communication should be easy. A good group member.

Seeing Baudouin’s woodworking skills, he had good hands. Shin Taemin’s skills were unquestionable.

"But where is Melissa? Does she even come to school?"

At Kang Lim’s question, Baudouin responded in a gentle voice.

He said that people shouldn't worry too much about Melissa as they thought.

"Melissa is in her third year, so she's quite busy. She's been running around shooting, so you haven't seen her lately. But for a group project, she'll come back right away! She only works on performance art, so she'll be helpful to us."

"Oh? Really? I didn't know. I never had a chance to talk about her work."

The unexpected fact was welcome.

Having a performance artist in the group was beneficial.

Thinking back, the assignment for Professor Alfonso was intentionally submitted like that.

"Baudouin, you're close with Melissa, right? Do you have her number?"

"Of course. I took the entrance exam with Melissa. We've known each other since preparing our portfolios."

"Then, can you share her number with me?"

That's how Kang Lim got the contact information of two members.

* * *

The first meeting of Kang Lim and his group members started at the student cafeteria.

Like tourists visiting Paris and taking a boat ride on the Seine River, this cafeteria was also on a boat.

Of course, it didn’t move. It just floated on the water, offering a nice view.

"This place is cheap and tasty. 4 euros for students is reasonable. It’s hard to get this much in Korea for 5,000 won."

Kang Lim cut into a thick hamburger steak.

He took a bite, pairing it with a fresh Caprese salad.

The crunchy texture went well with the tender meat.

They put Camembert cheese on all the dishes here, which enhanced the flavor.

It matched perfectly with the sweet éclair dessert that followed. A sumptuous meal.

Baudouin was taking pictures of the cafeteria scenery with his phone.

"When you're abroad, it's easy to spend money quickly. Seeing other countries' currencies makes it hard to gauge how much you're spending. So when Taemin said he was broke, I showed him all the student cafeterias in the city."

"Wow. Baudouin, you're the best. You got a good roommate, Shin Taemin."

Shin Taemin nodded without saying much.

He didn't have much allowance, so he had to be frugal.

Baudouin, feeling sorry for him, grumbled.

"You should quit smoking. You’d save more money."

"I don't smoke much. I only did it at home because you were messy."

"...What? Is that serious?"

"Yeah. It’s a kind of revenge. You don’t clean the room."

Wow, he says it outright. Does it still not change?

Watching the two, Kang Lim cleared his empty plate.

Despite their bickering, they seemed close, which was nice to see.

"Just quit both. Taemin, stop smoking, and Baudouin, clean the room."

As the two roommates were about to reach an agreement, Melissa arrived.

The group had already moved to the terrace and was having tea.

"Sorry! I’m a bit late, right?"

"It’s okay. We were just about to start the meeting."

Melissa took off her large backpack and pulled out a laptop.

Water dripped from her red hair.

She was in the same state as when Kang Lim first saw her.

No, back then, her hair seemed more like it was frozen solid. So cold it could break if touched.

Now, fortunately, it had warmed up.

"Hehe. You're Kang Lim, right?"

"Yes, nice to meet you."

"Wow, amazing! When Baudouin first contacted me, I thought it was a joke."

Melissa grabbed Kang Lim's hand, her eyes sparkling.

Her fingers were long and thin, with a surprisingly strong grip.

"I'm a big fan! I'm so happy to be in the same group. It’s been a dream to collaborate with a famous artist!"

Kang Lim awkwardly smiled and replied.

"Haha. I don’t think I'm that famous, but thank you. I’m also glad to be working with all four of us."

"Shall we see what each of us is working on? Combining our strengths will increase the quality."

"Yes. That's what I wanted too."

Melissa meticulously examined the portfolios of Kang Lim and Shin Taemin.

They said the exchange students from the East had great work, and it was true.

"Wow! Taemin's work is amazing too. I knew Kang Lim’s work, but here’s another hidden gem."

"Thank you. But I’m not sure how my painting will help with performance art. I can't think of any ideas either."

Melissa burst into laughter at Shin Taemin's words.

"Haha! Ideas? Just leave that to Melissa! It's all done!"

She showed a well-organized video on her laptop with a confident expression.

The work was shot in various locations, from demolished villages and abandoned factories to eerie asylums.

Melissa fitted her body into the gaps or broken parts of the scenery.

She filled the cracks in broken walls or torn tarps.

She painted her body to match the place, as if trying to become part of it...

The video was very long.

Considering the playback time, each one was over 12 hours, so they couldn't watch it all.

Melissa barely moved, making it seem like a still image.

"Cool, right? It’s about filling the empty spaces. It's a performance mourning the abandoned. It’s like honoring the place.

Most people only love living things that move. But space is also alive! Right? People destroy and get rid of it too easily."

Unlike the cheerful Melissa, the other group members were silent.

Her unique poses seemed impossible to replicate.

"Wow... How are you so flexible? Fitting your body like Tetris blocks..."

"I can do more!"

Melissa was delighted by Kang Lim's reaction and showed various movements.

From sticking her tongue out to touch her nose to bending her hand to touch her arm...

She was a person who twisted here and there like a fish in water.

"Wow... I know some flexible performance artists, but you're much more impressive."

"Hahaha! It's natural talent! Let's all try it!"

"......"

Melissa used her interlocked arms as a jump rope over her head.

Baudouin sighed as he watched her.

Kang Lim and Shin Taemin's faces grew pale.

It felt like watching a freak show.

"Melissa, stop. That's not it."

"Why? It would be more fun with all four of us! We can cover larger parts together!"

"First, the project should be near the school. The professor wanted it done internally."

"Damn it!"

Melissa frowned, thinking of the Beaux-Arts.

Built during the reign of Louis XIV, it boasted a 350-year history with 17th-century sculptures scattered around.

"Ah! Then how about becoming the missing parts of the ancient statues in the first-floor corridor? Many are missing heads or arms, right?

The Royal Academy symbolizes a public educational institution. It’s about breaking traditional notions and integrating free work!”

Baudouin shook his head at Melissa's suggestion.

"No. Citizens will come for the school open day. I saw other teams performing at the cultural center auditorium. If we do as you say, we'll just be overshadowed."

"What? That’s the most splendid place. Luxury fashion shows often take place there. People will flock there even if we do nothing."

Kang Lim nodded. The Beaux-Arts auditorium was indeed a splendid space.

The floor was adorned with elaborate tiles symbolizing the sun and stars, and the walls were draped with soft crimson velvet curtains.

Just walking in the center would draw attention.

"I also think it would be good if citizens could participate when they come."

"True, performance art is divided into two types: just for viewing or involving the audience to create unexpected moments..."

Melissa agreed with Kang Lim's words and pondered.

Due to space constraints, it was hard to come up with fresh ideas.

After a long time, she spoke out of nowhere.

"But didn’t you say you have a solo exhibition coming up, Kang Lim?"

"Yes, that’s right. Why?"

"How about using that theme? Seniors often expand their assignments for exhibitions when they take workshops."

"That would be great. But how can we express life and death through performance art?"

"Hmm... Just a moment."

Melissa rummaged through her laptop.

There were dozens of folders on the desktop, half of them newly named.

"Ah, where did I store it?"

She clicked rapidly.

Click. Click. Click. Click.

To Kang Lim's ears, the sound was chaotic.

Oddly, it overlapped with the shutter sound the professor used to record the group members.

Click. Click. Click. Click.

"Ah, why can't I find it? I had an idea saved separately."

Unlike Melissa's disappointed expression, Kang Lim's eyes lit up.

In his mind, he drew the floor plan of the Barbara Gallery.

‘When visitors enter the exhibition hall for my solo exhibition, I hoped they’d have a new and enjoyable visual experience in Zone A.’

An idea came to him that could fulfill that.

With this group, it was achievable.

Kang Lim spoke with a bright expression.

"Is there a square space in the school? A completely empty one."
