## Episode 32: Public Art

Who said Dobby was a slave?

All art students are slaves to Adobe.

"Ah. Using an old version after getting used to Photoshop CC is so inconvenient. It's practically Photoflat..."

But there's no better program than this.

Kang Lim calculated the cost of the computer program and retouched the photos.

It was for a Corial Fresh display project.

They were given three weeks for the assignment, but with plenty of time before the competition, they added a few natural-looking leaves among the flowers with Yoon Jangmi.

A perfect finish on top of perfection.

He uploaded the retouched photo with vivid and clear colors to the messenger.

[Kang Lim: (Photo) Is this good enough?]

[Yoon Jangmi: Okay. Perfect.]

[Lee Hyunseong: Wow, you did a great job with the retouching.]

[Kang Lim: We'll know the results in a month when the new product launches in all stores.]

[Yoon Jangmi: I want to see a CF come out with our concept.]

[Lee Hyunseong: Me too.]

[Kang Lim: Everyone worked hard.]

[Yoon Jangmi: You worked the hardest. Let's claim the computer program cost and materials for the display from the prize money.]

[Kang Lim: Okay. We'll at least get an honorable mention.]

[Yoon Jangmi: What's with just an honorable mention with this quality... If we get the grand prize, you should take more of the prize money.]

[Kang Lim: Oh, what's this?]

[Lee Hyunseong: Yeah, I think we have a good chance too. You really worked hard. Noona also worked hard.]

[Kang Lim: You worked hard too.]

A heartwarming conclusion.

Isn't it said that the set of a high-rated drama is always harmonious?

The same was true for Kang Lim and his team members.

Everyone was happy because they received high grades, allowing for pleasant conversations.

Kang Lim looked at his team members with a proud smile.

[Kang Lim: I'll miss you all...]

Thinking of other team members made Yoon Jangmi and Lee Hyunseong look like angels.

[Lee Hyunseong: LOL, what's with you?]

[Kang Lim: I have to go now... I have something important to do.]

[Yoon Jangmi: Kang Lim, you're busy from the start of the vacation.]

[Lee Hyunseong: What are you doing?]

[Kang Lim: I'm making a public sculpture exhibition in Hongdae.]

[Yoon Jangmi: Oh, impressive.]

[Lee Hyunseong: Wow, isn't that a city-supported project? Only experienced artists who have debuted do that... awesome.]

[Kang Lim: …….]

[Lee Hyunseong: I knew it since the magazine came out. It's not about having a lot of mediocre experience, but about the impact. Let us know when you set it up. We'll come see it.]

[Kang Lim: Sure.]

Kang Lim turned off the computer screen and grabbed a yellow tape measure from his desk drawer.

He had to go back to the site to measure the installation location.

Around the time of the Corial Fresh awards ceremony, the street exhibition would also be completed.

* * *

“Wow, the traffic jams are still the same…”

Exit 9 of Hongik University is always crowded with people lining up to go up.

It's busiest on Friday nights, and weekends are even worse.

Kang Lim was climbing the stairs through the bustling crowd.

“They're more diligent than I thought.”

Although the first impression was hopeless, he saw that Lee Hyerim and Hong Yoonki had already arrived.

Ten minutes before the appointment time.

As expected, they're pros in this aspect.

You become like that when you serve someone like Han Jungpil.

It becomes second nature.

“Yoonki, be nice when Kang Lim arrives. You saw last time, didn't you? He doesn't do things he doesn't want, professor or not. Don't upset him. If he refuses to do it, we’ll be in trouble…”

“Wow, you thought the same as me…”

Interestingly, Lee Hyerim and Hong Yoonki were arguing.

“…Thinking about it, Professor Han Jungpil could easily win such projects. If he wanted, he could get a sculpture project in front of a building. But why hasn't he done it before?”

“Then why is he doing this project? I really don't know. It's driving me crazy! What does he want? He keeps threatening to fire us... It's frustrating.”

“…Let's just do a really good job. There must be a reason for sending Kang Lim.”

“An artist, huh... Han Jungpil isn't Goo Haeyoung.”

“They're similar in rank. They think differently from us.”

“Similar, my foot…”

“Anyway, do a good job. Even if the project is small, a lot of higher-ups will be watching since it's a city-funded project.”

“Got it…”

Kang Lim interjected between the bickering two.

“Hello. What are you guys talking about so passionately?”

“Oh, surprise!”

Lee Hyerim was startled by Kang Lim's sudden appearance but tried to stay composed.

“Haha, you're here, Kang Lim.”

Lee Hyerim awkwardly smiled, shaking the mini fan she was holding.

Maybe because it was hot, her glasses were slipping down her sweat-covered nose.

“Hi.”

Hong Yoonki greeted while looking elsewhere, worried that Kang Lim might have heard their conversation.

“When did you both get here? It's hot, you must have come early.”

“No, we just got here. Let's go! Let's work!”

Kang Lim laughed seeing Lee Hyerim clench her fist with determination.

Alright, let's do a good job with this team too.

* * *

“The street we want to walk starts a bit past Exit 9, so it's not that wide. We can look around quickly. Shall we start from the airport railroad side?”

“Sure. Let’s see where it would be best to install.”

Seeing Lee Hyerim readily accept Kang Lim’s suggestion, Hong Yoonki pouted.

“I disagree. Exit 9 of Hongdae is the busiest place. If we want it to stand out, we should install it here. It's hot, and we’ll lose focus, so let's start with the important spots. If we can't think of anything here, we can go up to the airport railroad side.”

Since he wasn't wrong, Kang Lim nodded.

Even if you don't just want attention, you need to stay in busy places to observe what people need.

Also, there's no reason to oppose everything Hong Yoonki says and ruin the relationship since they're working together.

‘After all, Yoonki is hyung in appearance. I should give him respect.’

Kang Lim had some social experience.

“Hyung is right. Let’s go up directly.”

Surprised by the quick agreement, Hong Yoonki's eyebrows briefly rose and fell.

“…Yeah. Thanks.”

* * *

The three wandered around slowly.

Honestly, it's rare for someone living in Seoul not to have had a meal in Hongdae.

Chicken restaurants, burger joints, waffle stands.

The scenery was so familiar they had it memorized.

“Well, I don't know if anything will come to mind by walking around. Honestly.”

Hearing Hong Yoonki's words, Kang Lim smiled slightly.

“But it's different when you come with the intention to work than just wandering around. Hyung, show your skills.”

“…Sure.”

Compared to Lee Hyerim and Hong Yoonki, the streets felt a bit unfamiliar to Kang Lim.

Because he could compare the scenery of the future and the past.

Later, cafes and clothing stores would fill the area, but now it mostly consisted of barbecue or chicken restaurants. It was predominantly food-related businesses.

The diversity of the commercial district wasn't as developed as in the future.

Installing a sexual artwork in such a place is absurd.

Placing an appetite-ruining piece near restaurants is disrespectful to the owners.

It would hurt their sales.

Walking along the street, Kang Lim became more convinced.

“I have a good idea.”

Ten minutes after slowly looking around, Hong Yoonki spoke first.

“You said provocative and explicit works aren't good, right? Then how about setting up a cool sculpture? Something contemporary art-like.”

“…What do you mean by contemporary art, hyung?”

“Well, like putting a dot?”

Are you sure you studied art abroad?

Kang Lim wanted to sigh but held it in.

It seemed like Hong Yoonki still enjoyed debates and issues.

“Contemporary art itself creates issues. It’s perfect for getting votes. We can make a huge dot or line and install it. It’s not explicit, so you could do it too.”

“Hyung. Strictly speaking, that’s not contemporary art. Even if you do such work these days, it's not well-received. Minimalism, which omits all sculptural elements and simplifies, is actually 80s art.”

“…….”

“After that, the prices went up, so it still circulates in auctions... If artists do that work now, they’re just seen as pretentious. It’s just a rehash of the past.”

“…But if we pour the budget into making a big statue, it’ll stand out.”

“This isn’t an art museum. Public art should prioritize people’s convenience. It should consider the place and environment.”

“Hmm…”

Kang Lim provided an easy example for Hong Yoonki to understand.

“There was a minimalist artist named Richard Serra. In 1981, he made a square sculpture crossing a plaza in front of a federal building in New York. As expected, it caused a stir.”

“Isn’t that good?”

“The problem was it wasn’t a good stir. The piece, unrelated to its surroundings, was criticized for blocking the citizens' view. It was even destroyed because it made walking difficult.”

“Wow. Even though it was a permanent installation?”

“Yes. It was destroyed by a court ruling in 1998.”

“Wow... They destroyed the piece. Citizens are impressive. But we’re only installing it temporarily. Let’s just do it.”

“This area has a lot of foot traffic. A big statue would only disrupt the flow. Even if it's temporary, it’s three weeks. That’s a long time, considering art exhibitions usually last a week. Let's do something else.”

“…Okay. I’ll follow your lead…”

When he couldn’t come up with an answer, Hong Yoonki took out a piece of gum and started chewing.

Though he was chewing gum loudly, his expression was much more docile than before.

Watching from between them, Lee Hyerim said to Kang Lim.

“True! The Claes Oldenburg piece in Cheonggyecheon also cost 3.4 billion and only got criticized. That conch shell. I think sculptures won’t really help people here.”

Nodding, Kang Lim mulled over it.

“Usually, art pieces are installed to enliven the street, but Hongdae already has plenty of energy... What would be good?”

Lee Hyerim suddenly clapped her hands.

“Wow. Talking about energy gave me an idea!”

“What is it?”

“How about street art? Hongdae has a free-spirited vibe. Kang Lim, you could paint a mural with spray paint!”

Is she saying she’ll just watch?

In this team, Kang Lim was the only one doing fine art.

If they did a mural, he would have to do it alone.

But he had no intention of working alone.

At least Lee Hyerim knew how to handle many computer programs.

“I can paint it, but... there are already lots of murals. And, as you know, there are no walls in the street we want.”

“Oh, right. There are no walls.”

“…….”

“Such a shame. If we did that, it would cause a huge stir. People would vote a lot saying it’s well-done.”

“Even if we get votes, the judges’ scores would be low.”

“Why?”

“City projects value fully utilizing the given budget. Spray paints wouldn’t use up 6 million won.”

“…True.”

The brainstorming session with unhelpful team members.

Kang Lim closed his eyes.

A summer festival... What kind of work would fit the purpose and enliven the atmosphere?

An installation piece that can be temporary...

And public art that can help someone.

Ugh, damn.

“Can be meaningful-♪”

Just then.

Music reached Kang Lim’s ears.

A clear voice slicing through the sky.

Unconsciously, he got goosebumps.

He quickly looked around...

He wasn’t the only one mesmerized.

“Wow... Really good.”

“Yeah, they’re good, but let’s go... My legs hurt.”

“Ah, let’s listen a bit more...”

Ah, this is it.
