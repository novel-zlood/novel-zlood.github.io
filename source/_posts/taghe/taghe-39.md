## Episode 39: Newcomer

The awards ceremony was held at the K-Pacific headquarters in Nonhyeon-dong.

Since it was a design contest for college students, most of the winners looked quite young.

Kang Lim, Lee Hyunseong, and Yoon Jangmi sat around a white round table covered with a tablecloth.

On the table was a nameplate that read Korea National University of Arts.

Kang Lim looked around at the names of the schools on each table.

Famous design schools like K University, H University, and S University… Various student teams were present.

Lee Hyunseong, perhaps a bit nervous, took a sip of water from a transparent wine glass and then spoke.

“Wow, I never thought I’d receive an award from such a big company. Since we’re the grand prize winners, the CEO will present the award himself. Amazing.”

Yoon Jangmi sighed as she looked at the well-dressed Hyunseong.

His hairstyle was similar to when they first met at the Koreal Fresh store.

“…He did the 2:8 hairstyle again.”

“No, Noona. It’s not 2:8. It’s pomade.”

Kang Lim placed his hand on his forehead and said.

“Why are you wearing a suit? People might think you’re a young startup entrepreneur.”

Hyunseong buttoned up his neatly pressed black jacket and replied.

“I wore it because there’s going to be an article. Does it look bad?”

“Well, since there’s going to be an article, you should’ve avoided it even more.”

“Hey, I didn’t expect you and Noona to come in just casual shirts and slacks. You could’ve given me a heads up. I’ve never done this before.”

In the end, Yoon Jangmi chuckled and said.

“Just take off the tie and the jacket; you’ll be fine.”

“Yeah, take it off right now.”

Yoon Jangmi glanced around and then asked Kang Lim.

“By the way, where’s Chaewon’s team? I thought they did well enough to be here.”

“Exactly. I thought their color cosmetics display would win. The world is indeed vast.”

Listening to Kang Lim and Yoon Jangmi’s conversation, Hyunseong added.

“According to Taemin, they didn’t get an award, but Son Chaewon Noona’s makeup skills were so outstanding that she’s been tasked with doing makeup for a new actress in an ad. She seems to have become a makeup artist.”

Of course, it’s Son Chaewon.

She’ll probably become famous even before her YouTube debut. She’s already doing makeup for celebrities.

She’s truly amazing.

Kang Lim, with a surprised look, said.

“Oh, that’s great. But why hasn’t it started yet?”

As expected, the host then went up to the podium to start the ceremony.

* * *

The host announced the winners for each category and showcased their display designs.

Starting with the encouragement award, K-Pacific employees gave congratulatory speeches.

The host mentioned that there were over 1,000 entries in the contest.

They added that all winners would receive extra points when applying for a job at K-Pacific, and graduating students would get internship opportunities.

“Wow—!”

Most of the design students cheered loudly at this news.

Only Kang Lim and his teammates waited calmly, uninterested.

The grand prize is always announced last.

“Only one work remains. It’s the grand prize winner.”

Since Kang Lim’s team was the only one that hadn’t gone up to the stage yet, perceptive students from other universities began to look their way.

“This work perfectly expressed Koreal Fresh’s values of ‘beauty and health’ and the brand message ‘We want to remain a lasting memory for our customers.’ Not only did it highlight the product’s functionality, but it also satisfied the unique aesthetic beauty of the display. This work will be installed at Koreal Fresh’s main store starting today. We also made a commercial with the same concept. Let’s watch it first.”

The lights dimmed, and the presentation screen came down.

--

Debussy’s Arabesque.

Soft piano melodies played as the screen gradually brightened.

A new actress wearing a white punched dress appeared.

With soft facial lines, a slender neck, and long eyes, she was a beautifully oriental actress.

The actress took out a product from a red mailbox and applied it to her skin.

She closed her eyes, savoring the scent, then took off her sandals and walked barefoot on the ground.

It was a direction that allowed one to fully feel the breath of nature.

Then suddenly.

The camera angle zoomed in on her white ankle and then pulled back.

A flower field reminiscent of the Alps, filled with wildflowers, unfolded.

The actress ran quickly through the flower path.

Ignoring the fluttering flowers, butterflies followed her.

Except for the area she passed, all the flowers withered, and the petals ascended into the sky as the screen darkened.

Koreal Fresh.

‘We present natural and healthy beauty.’

In the end, the screen displayed a clean brand logo and elegant typography.

--

“Wow… That’s insane. The petals rising, that’s CGI, right?”

“They represented the healthy scent being followed by butterflies. Great idea.”

“They say the display stands are also arranged according to the scent.”

Voices of admiration for Kang Lim’s team came from everywhere.

Kang Lim and his teammates exchanged proud looks, as the commercial turned out much better than they had expected.

“Now, the honor of today’s grand prize goes to the team from Korea National University of Arts! Kang Lim’s team, please come forward!”

As soon as the host finished speaking, cheers and applause erupted.

Kang Lim and his teammates went up to the stage with slightly embarrassed faces.

The CEO handed the certificate to Kang Lim and awarded plaques to all team members.

As expected from a large company, they had made individual plaques for each member.

Holding a poster board that indicated the prize money of 15 million won and a bouquet of flowers, they posed for a commemorative photo, and the host made a joke.

“Although I’m not sure if it’s needed, given the number of men in the team, we’re also providing all the new products as prizes.”

Laughter erupted from the crowd.

Kang Lim laughed along and thought.

Only one person came to his mind.

‘I’ll give it to my mother.’

* * *

Seosomun Government Complex, Building 1. Design Policy Division conference room.

All the members of the Public Art Committee, advisory panel, and the project manager were present at the meeting.

Generally, Public Art Committee members and the project manager are civil servants, while the advisory panel consists of active artists.

Since public art involves local government budgets, it’s beneficial for people from both fields to discuss together.

The chair of the Art Committee, who was leading the meeting, opened the discussion.

“The first agenda item today is whether to accept the citizens’ request to permanently install Kang Lim’s artwork. What do you think, Chairman of the Advisory Committee, about the artistic value of this work?”

Han Jungpil felt proud of Kang Lim but answered calmly without showing it.

“First, I think we should hear the evaluation of the project manager who oversaw the progress of this project.”

The chair of the Art Committee nodded and said.

“Indeed, the aesthetic value and artistic merit of this work seem already clear from the public response. It’s a beautiful sculpture even to my eyes. Let’s first hear the project manager’s report from a public perspective.”

Han Jungpil knew how meticulous the newly appointed project manager was.

Although quite young, reaching the sixth rank in the civil service at that age was no easy feat.

Surely, he must have an incredibly meticulous personality.

‘Given the chair’s significant trust in the project manager, a positive evaluation would be extremely beneficial for Kang Lim.’

The project manager stepped forward, lowered the presentation screen, and began to speak.

“I also prioritized public value when I first took on this project. The advisory panel might prioritize artistic value more, but I couldn’t accept the previous winning works chosen annually. That’s why I proposed on-site voting to the chair this year, which I believe everyone knows.”

The advisory panel members, who also thought the previous winners’ works lacked artistic value, nodded.

Of course, some felt guilty for recommending those works.

“Kang Lim’s piece won overwhelmingly in the public vote. Judging by the continuous responses requesting its permanent installation, it hasn’t undermined the public interest. Especially, the canopy, though quite large, doesn’t obstruct walking since it’s in the form of pillars.

On the contrary, creating steps on the fan-shaped ground increased walkability and provided a space for citizens to enjoy a festive atmosphere, fitting the local commercial area. I gave particularly high marks for achieving this with a modest budget.”

Indeed... Han Jungpil nodded, listening to the project manager.

“Moreover, the work was created over three weeks using recycled materials collected around the Hongdae area. Showing the amount of discarded waste to people over three weeks raised awareness and brought about environmental benefits by turning it into an artwork.”

The project manager changed the presentation slide.

When a picture of Olafur Eliasson’s <Ice Watch> appeared, he continued.

“This work was created to raise awareness about global warming. The artist moved a chunk of Greenland’s glacier to Copenhagen’s city hall square to show the melting ice to viewers directly.

However, the problem was that moving this glacier consumed thousands of tons of carbon dioxide. Although it was said to be for the environment, it paradoxically caused destruction. I examined whether Kang Lim made a similar mistake.”

Han Jungpil’s eyes widened.

He had never seen such a sensitive project manager.

“While collecting recyclables, he didn’t raid intact trash bins or purchase large quantities of plastic. Nor did he waste a lot of water and detergent cleaning the recyclables. He used a large basin to soak the items several times. I was personally moved by these hidden project details.”

This was something Kang Lim had emphasized to Hong Yoonki several times.

While working on an environmentally themed project, one should not destroy the environment.

Kang Lim didn’t want to become a shallow populist.

“Moreover, he attached receipts for every purchase, down to ten-won units, in order. I couldn’t believe it was someone’s first project of this kind. He’s only twenty years old, right? There seems to be nothing left for me to evaluate.”

As the project manager concluded and returned to his seat, Han Jungpil sighed in relief.

He believed Kang Lim was the only one who wouldn’t show any weaknesses in front of such a meticulous project manager.

The chair of the Art Committee, with a satisfied smile, spoke.

“I’m in favor of permanent installation. If anyone opposes, please speak freely.”

All attendees quietly raised their hands one by one, voicing their agreement and approval.

There were no opposing opinions.

“Then, we’ll pass this agenda item unanimously. The next agenda item is the Songdo New Town Art Revital Park sculpture project. Chairman of the Advisory Committee, do you have any artist recommendations?”

Han Jungpil had saved his words to answer this question.

Finally, he could confidently say it.

“I recommend the artist Kang Lim, whom we just saw. As he’s still unknown, it aligns well with the government’s initiative to introduce emerging artists.”

The chair of the Art Committee nodded and said.

“But... he’s only twenty. It might be burdensome since it’s a two-billion-won sculpture.”

Han Jungpil shook his head and replied.

“Not at all. It will be a while before Art Revital is built. By then, if we review Kang Lim’s portfolio again, we might even have to invite him.”

Laughter erupted from the members of the Art Committee.

They were not art majors and had never closely observed Kang Lim’s artistic work.

In other words, they didn’t recognize Kang Lim’s potential and value.

The chair of the Art Committee laughed along and then said.

“Ha-ha. Is that Professor Han Jungpil’s opinion?”

Han Jungpil calmly laughed and replied.

“No. It’s the opinion of Professor Koo Haeyoung.”

At that, the room fell silent in an instant.

They realized how uncultured their laughter had been.

Professor Koo Haeyoung’s position was such.

The chair of the Art Committee, clearing his throat, said.

“Alright. Then we’ll list him as the top priority artist. Let’s look forward to it in a year.”
