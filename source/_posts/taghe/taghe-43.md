## Episode 43: Signature

Gerald Moore was moving a vase to plant orchids when he saw the freshman's studio lights on.

"To think there's a freshman working so diligently even during the break."

Gerald, feeling pleased, went up to encourage the students.

But then...

He happened to overhear a conversation between Kang Lim and Shin Taemin and, startled, broke the vase.

Right after that, he contacted Koo Haeyoung.

He wanted to quickly explain why he was so surprised.

Koo Haeyoung, upon receiving Gerald's call, came to the school.

* * *

In Gerald's studio, two paintings were hung.

One was the painting Kang Lim drew for his entrance exam.

The other was "The Banality of Evil," which Kang Lim had submitted to a group exhibition.

Gerald, oblivious to Koo Haeyoung's arrival, was staring at the paintings.

Koo Haeyoung, unaware that Gerald had purchased Kang Lim's paintings, opened his mouth in surprise.

"You bought it, huh."

Only then did Gerald turn his head quickly and shout with a playful expression.

"Haha! Turning 3 million won into 300 million!"

"......"

"No, not even 300 million. It might go higher if I hold onto it. But when did you get here?"

"Just now."

Koo Haeyoung shook his head and sat on a nearby chair to look at the paintings together.

Gerald pointed at "The Banality of Evil" and said,

"That painting always reminds me of Gerhard Richter. Not just because he painted Germans... but because of his unique sense that transcends both abstraction and representation."

Gerhard Richter is a representative painter of Germany.

He is the most renowned living painting artist.

He was born in East Germany, but just before the Berlin Wall was erected, he moved to West Germany for a freer artistic environment.

In East Germany, he had to paint pictures that praised socialism and couldn't include personal individuality in his artwork.

Because of one painting, he abandoned a stable life and moved, struggling to adapt to capitalist society without a penny.

Socialism and capitalism.

His life, which transcended two completely different extremes, is reflected in his works that also transcend abstraction and representation.

One is a meticulously realistic work like a photograph.

The other is an abstract work devoid of any form.

Kang Lim's work was similar.

The special difference was that Kang Lim incorporated both realism and abstraction into a single painting.

Gerald, as if finding it fascinating, said,

"Look at how he painted the military uniform. It's so realistic that it looks like a collage. Such hyperrealism is impossible without innate descriptive abilityâ€”requiring both delicate hands and sharp eyes. But realism is ultimately a self-deprecating art form that merely imitates photographs. So, this guy cleverly mixed a spoonful of abstract individuality into it..."

Gerald traced the decayed person's skin with his finger.

Opaque and twisted features as if covered in lime.

Entangled forms felt cold and resembled gray chunks of meat rather than a person.

Standing in front of these people, one felt a surreal and eerie chill.

Strokes that collide, push, and drift...

When one mixed their gaze and breath with it...

They were always standing in another time and space.

"He cleverly depicts realistic details and then paints abstractly as if exploding a preheated brush. Balancing these conflicting images harmoniously. This is Kang Lim's signature. He may not realize it himself, but... this guy already has his own worldview. Come to think of it, his first installation work was like that too. Coldly severed books and hotly swirling books!"

Koo Haeyoung asked Gerald, who was muttering,

"So, did you call to brag about buying the painting?"

"Oh, no!"

"Then?"

"As you know, this guy has always painted these pictures solely from the images in his head since the entrance exam... Isn't that strange?"

"It's special."

"Yes. It's too special. But I found out the reason. And I think he has a truckload of such paintings."

"A truckload?"

"I saw him working with a friend in the classroom during the break... He said he has had the ability to remember everything since he was six years old. And since then, he's been painting. Imagine how much he must have accumulated!"

"Since six years old..."

"The painting I saw in the classroom today felt similar to this one. A delicately drawn woman and a fragmented background clashing out of perspective."

"I'm curious."

"We can't just sit here! We need to send him to the Biennale right away! This guy isn't someone to be hidden only in Korea. Only you and I can recognize his true value."

Koo Haeyoung stroked his chin, contemplating.

The ability to remember everything wasn't particularly surprising.

In fact, just by looking at the painting he drew for the entrance exam, one could guess that much.

A painting that brought back to life already dead historical figures was right in front of them.

However, there was still one thing lacking to send him out into the world.

A bit more...

Something deeper...

Surely, this guy's potential shouldn't end here.

"No, not yet... Not yet."

Seeing Koo Haeyoung's calm demeanor, Gerald shouted in frustration.

"What's not yet! You aren't worried he'll become corrupt by making a lot of money at twenty, are you?"

"......"

"We're here to create art, not to become saints! It's good if the painting's value rises quickly. Who cares."

"Your Korean has improved a lot."

"Was my rhyme good?"

"Yes."

Gerald grinned broadly and then frowned again.

"Ugh! Haeyoung! That's not what's important."

Koo Haeyoung chuckled and said,

"Let's give him an assignment in our class that can fully unleash his potential. Something that can stimulate his depths..."

"What nonsense is that! A painting should leave you in awe at first sight."

Ignoring Gerald's grumbling, Koo Haeyoung left the room.

Looking at the clear sky, one could sense that autumn was approaching quickly.

Although the heat hadn't completely subsided, the weather was quite cool.

Kang Lim went to school just like he did during the break.

The only difference was that the second semester classes started today.

After adding four more pieces to his series, the summer break ended.

"There's still plenty of time until the portfolio submission for the solo exhibition. I'll just paint more during the Western Painting class."

Kang Lim turned on his phone to check today's schedule.

The morning class was "Introduction to Digital Design," and the afternoon class was "Media Expression Study."

"Finally, I get to attend Professor Gerald Moore's class today."

Kang Lim moved to Building A of the College of Fine Arts.

It was where the computer lab was located.

Creak.

When he opened the classroom door, the first thing he saw was Seoyeon sitting in the front row.

As expected, she's quite the model student.

"Ha. Long time no see."

When Kang Lim bowed to greet her, Seoyeon also bowed in return.

"Yes. Long time no see."

Seoyeon yawned so wide it seemed her small mouth would tear.

Having just returned from abroad, she was really tired.

Seoyeon had been meeting numerous exhibition planners and art dealers throughout the break, taking curating classes.

In fact, the art market situation and scale in Korea and abroad are vastly different, so it's almost impossible to learn only in Korea.

Moreover, studying art history in-depth was ultimately to better understand contemporary art trends.

Meeting artists who lead the art world in real-time was more important than anything.

"Yeah... I was too confined to art history. Now I need to look at the future, not the past."

Kang Lim sat next to Seoyeon and turned on the computer.

Seoyeon's silent face looked as if she was zoning out.

"What are you thinking about so much?"

Awakened from her thoughts by Kang Lim's question, Seoyeon yawned again.

Although her mind was clear, her body hadn't yet adjusted to the time difference.

"Nothing. Did you have a good break? What did you do?"

"I painted, of course. Why are you yawning so much? Didn't you sleep well?"

Although no one pushed Seoyeon, the sun in Europe during summer doesn't set until after 10 p.m.

Strangely, it felt like she worked harder than usual.

"Yeah. I didn't sleep well. You must have missed me during the break~."

"Wow... You shopped for a month, and now you're teasing me too."

"Haha. But I did stay in touch."

While the two were exchanging jokes,

A dozen Fine Arts students had all taken their seats.

Usually, people who weren't there suddenly fill up the room just before class starts.

"Hello. I am the professor in charge of this class..."

The professor introduced himself and briefly explained the course outline.

"Introduction to Digital Design is a class that teaches essential computer programs for fine arts students. It's not as difficult as design classes, so don't be intimidated. Depending on how you use Photoshop, the level can vary greatly."

In this class, they would learn Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.

"With these programs, you'll be able to create exhibition catalogs, leaflets, and banners."

Even if one is selected for a gallery or museum contest, many times they don't fund the creation of catalogs.

So, the ability to create these things oneself is necessary.

Design firms charge varying amounts, but most of them ask for at least 1 million won to design a book containing over 30 pieces of art.

If a student isn't selected for a contest, they would have to cover both the exhibition and book design costs.

So even if one just wants to paint, they need to know basic computer programs to save money.

"Photoshop is mainly used for editing artwork photos, Illustrator is used for creating large-scale posters or banners as it doesn't pixelate, and InDesign is used for making catalogs."

Kang Lim nodded comfortably.

Honestly, it was a class he could take with ease.

For a designer, those three programs should be second nature.

The national design certificate, "Graphic Design Craftsman," includes those three programs.

"I'll teach you how to use these tools, and your grades will be based on creating a book. Use Photoshop and Illustrator to create images and edit them into a storybook using InDesign."

"But you said it's easy," "You said not to be scared!" The students murmured.

The assignment seemed more complicated than expected.

It was practically asking them to become illustrators.

The professor chuckled and continued,

"As it's your first time, don't expect the quality of commercially sold books. Just create comfortably. You can even simplify a famous story. Got it?"

The students sighed in relief.

They already had a lot of other assignments.

"Oh. I'll make an original storybook and submit it to a contest."

Only Kang Lim was thinking differently.

Last semester, after doing part-time jobs and participating in an advertisement contest as assignments,

He couldn't just settle for assignments now; he felt restless.

"A storybook contest offers a big prize, and if I make a really good one, I could earn royalties for life. I have to do my best."

Moreover, he had a reliable source of advice.

His mother was a novelist, and she would provide good guidance.
