## Episode 14: A Work Reflecting the Times

“Yes. Please go ahead.”

Goo Haeyoung handed the floor over to Kang Lim.

Kang Lim pointed at the screen and spoke to the students.

“Both [Lonesome Cowboy] and [Hiropon] are works that explicitly emphasize sexual elements. The interesting thing is that the male otaku character sculpture sold for 17 billion won, while the female one sold for 1.4 billion won. Why is there such a significant price difference? To us, they don't seem that different.”

Goo Haeyoung looked at Kang Lim with an intrigued expression.

He had never heard of a student so well-versed in recent art auctions. This was something only those interested in the art market, like critics, would know.

What's even more surprising is that the part Kang Lim pointed out was also a question Goo Haeyoung had.

Although the auction periods for the works were different, it was rare to see such a stark price difference in similar works.

Of course, Goo Haeyoung had drawn his own conclusions.

He wondered what Kang Lim thought...

A smile of curiosity naturally formed on his lips.

“Right. Why is the male sculpture more expensive?”

“Maybe a gay person bought it? To display at home.”

“Oh, come on. Would a gay person buy it? A collector must have acquired it.”

The students buzzed as they speculated on the reasons.

Kang Lim had already transformed the contemptuous looks of the students into ones of curiosity.

Giving them ample time to theorize...

When the curiosity peaked and the attention was focused on Kang Lim...

He spoke again.

“I think it’s because of the era the artist worked in. The professor said that an artist's life is reflected in their work. The life of an artist is a reflection of the era they live in.

These works were created in the 1990s in Japan. This was a time when Japan's economy was struggling. Many men found it hard to be recognized in society and couldn’t meet the financial standards women demanded.

As a result, many men gave up on dating or marriage and stayed home watching anime.

If we interpret these works in the context of that era, they provide a catharsis for the suppressed masculinity of the so-called 'herbivore men.'

In short, they accurately reflect that era. One could even interpret that it has a close relation to the artist himself.”

Indeed, the expected answer came.

This wasn’t just an interpretation from an art historical perspective.

Goo Haeyoung decided to listen to the rest of Kang Lim's explanation and observe the students' reactions.

“Wow. I never thought of it that way.”

“So that's why it's more expensive.”

About half of the class had their perspective on the work flipped by Kang Lim's interpretation.

It wasn't just the content of his speech, but Kang Lim's clear and powerful voice that made it trustworthy.

Having given them enough time to think, Kang Lim began to speak again.

“What if someone says, ‘A good work should record its era and embody individual personality?’ By that standard, this work is undoubtedly good. Honestly, it is unique, right? There were no such sculptures in pure art before.”

“Now that you mention it, that seems true.”

“Indeed! Being the pioneer is important in anything...”

“Looking at it again, it seems good...”

The students, swayed by Kang Lim’s opinion, quickly agreed.

On the other hand, Goo Haeyoung chuckled and shook his head.

He knew exactly what Kang Lim meant.

Kang Lim wasn’t simply defending Takashi.

He was just informing the students of one of the criteria the art world and market use to evaluate works.

Finally, Goo Haeyoung took back the floor to continue the class.

“So, do you like that work, Kang Lim? Because it reflects the era Murakami lived in?”

“No. Not at all.”

The unexpected answer caused a stir in the class.

Most students reacted with, ‘Then why did you praise it so much?’

Goo Haeyoung smiled again.

And, knowing the answer, he asked Kang Lim once more.

To convey an important point to the students.

“Why not?”

“Because I don't like it. Honestly, even if I don't fully understand the flow and context of art history, I want to create works that people can empathize with.”

Boldness.

It was an answer that could be seen as arrogant, but Goo Haeyoung nodded.

An artist needs such courage.

One shouldn't waver in their emotions based on others' evaluations, like the students here.

Even if those evaluations come from authoritative critics.

A good work is something only the artist themselves can truly recognize.

“A work that can be empathized with, even without understanding the context... Can it truly be both popular and meaningful?”

Currently, the perspectives of the art world and the public are completely incompatible.

Like oil and water, they can't mix.

A work recognized in the contemporary art world rarely receives public love.

But.

Goo Haeyoung thought that maybe this kid might be able to achieve it.

“So, is it good or bad?”

The confused students buzzed again.

Goo Haeyoung raised a hand to silence the students and spoke again.

“The point is not whether it is within the flow of art history or not.

Today's assignment is this.

Create yourself within the society you live in.

Reflect on the past twenty years of your life. It can be both short and long.

You are free to choose the materials, but the work must be three-dimensional. As you know, you have three weeks.”

* * *

After class ended.

Once Goo Haeyoung left the room, the classroom became noisy again.

The students gathered in their seats, sighing one by one.

Those most displeased with the assignment were the design students.

“I have no idea how to make this.”

“Me neither. Isn't this too advantageous for the sculpture students? They’ve been solving weird problems since they entered.”

“Stop whining. We all take turns with the professors for these common assignments anyway. When a design professor comes, they’ll complain too.”

The architecture students were less dissatisfied.

They were somewhat accustomed to making three-dimensional structures.

In fact, many architecture schools, including Hanyang University, have entrance exams involving the creation of sculptural structures.

They rarely felt uncomfortable about making things by hand.

“Why are they whining? It's hard for us too.”

Lee Hyunseong clicked his tongue at the design students.

Except for students who majored in sculpture at art high schools, even the sculpture students weren't particularly accustomed to making things.

“We learn in material science classes, right? Woodworking, printmaking, oil painting, crafts... We do everything, so it can be frustrating.”

At Kang Lim's words, Lee Hyunseong replied incredulously.

“Hey. That means the assignments are too many and disadvantageous for us. Not everyone is like you.”

“Really...?”

“...Let's not talk.”

* * *

Three weeks later,

The day before the common assignment presentation.

Shin Taemin was doing the final touch-up on his work in the studio.

Although woodworks usually only require sanding for finishing, there was an additional process due to the subject of the work.

He took a deep breath for the final touch.

It was a moment that required concentration.

But there was one thing that was bothering him...

Seo Yeon was peeking at his partition from the wall side.

“What are you looking at, chaebol girl?”

Seo Yeon was startled by the term Shin Taemin used and shouted back. But her voice was much smaller than her action.

“Hey! Are you crazy? I told you not to call me that. Should I tell everyone that your dad is a professor?”

“Go ahead.”

“What? Do you like being in the spotlight?”

“No.”

Shin Taemin always acted like this towards Seo Yeon.

An expression that looked constantly annoyed. A voice with no highs or lows.

It had been the same since high school and was infuriating.

“Where did you pick up that ragged outfit? Did you go shopping in Dongdaemun?”

Seo Yeon glanced down at her clothes.

She was wearing a checkered shirt over a white T-shirt and jeans, suitable for the changing seasons.

She had become a bit more relaxed since she first entered school...

She chose the outfit because she thought it would be comfortable for working.

“Why. Does it look too much like an engineering student?”

Shin Taemin sighed as if that wasn’t what he meant.

“Ugh. How long are you going to cosplay as a beggar?”

“Beggar cosplay...? It’s just normal clothes.”

“Do whatever you want. It’d be better if you leave since you’re distracting me.”

“Such a nasty personality. I didn’t come to see you.”

Seo Yeon turned her head abruptly and looked at Kang Lim’s empty seat.

Kang Lim, who always had unique interpretations, was Seo Yeon’s number one observation target.

“Already eager to own it, huh?”

At Shin Taemin's sarcastic comment, Seo Yeon's face flushed.

“Hey. Don’t phrase it like that! I’m just curious. Honestly, aren’t you curious about what Kang Lim will make? Didn’t you see him talking with Professor Goo Haeyoung...?”

“Since I sit next to him, I’ve seen the whole process, so I’m not that curious.”

“Then where is he?”

“I don’t know.”

“Is that Kang Lim’s work?”

When Seo Yeon pointed at the pedestal covered with a black cloth, a brief answer came.

“Yes.”

“Would it be wrong to peek when no one’s here...?”

Although she said that, her legs moved towards the work on their own.

As she hesitated...

Someone tapped her shoulder from behind.

She got goosebumps, knowing Shin Taemin wouldn't do such a thing.

Turning around, she was relieved to see the face she had been waiting for.

“What are you doing here?”

“Uh! I wanted to see.”

Seo Yeon, flustered and omitting the subject, saw Kang Lim pointing at himself.

“Me?”

“No. Your work. Don’t flatter yourself...”

“Oh. Then just take a look. That’s not like you.”

“Excuse me... I do have manners. I was waiting because I thought there might be a reason for covering it.”

“Good job. Actually, I covered it because I didn’t like it.”

“What...? Why don’t you like it?”

Kang Lim looked much calmer than usual. To Seo Yeon, he seemed somewhat pensive.

“But now you can see it.”

Kang Lim casually pulled the cloth.

She had worried that the work might not turn out well. But to her surprise.

Seo Yeon's expression gradually transformed into one of amazement.

The work was completely different from the despondent look on Kang Lim’s face.

“Wow... It’s a self-portrait?”

It was a sculpture of Kang Lim without the back of his head.

The face met the front face, creating a deformed look that was so detailed it was hard to believe it was plaster.

The hair hung down like it was wet, and the tears in the eyes flowed down the soft skin. It seemed like touching the delicate cheeks would cause them to crumble.

“But it’s so sad.”

Seo Yeon suddenly became curious about what kind of life Kang Lim had led.

Most artists who created self-portraits had sad lives, but the work itself emitted a strong sense of appeal.

“I only have a front face because I’ve always looked forward. Originally, I was going to exhibit a sculpture with only a back head as well. It’s problematic to live only looking forward, and it’s also problematic to live always looking back with regret. I understand why people might do that, given how suffocating our world is, but...”

As if reading her mind, Kang Lim explained the work, and Seo Yeon felt moved.

‘So, this is one way to express it.’

“This is how you see our society right now... But where’s the sculpture with the back head?”

“Oh. I just destroyed it.”

“W-What?”

Seo Yeon’s face filled with disbelief at the unexpected answer.

Kang Lim spoke in a calm voice, as if it was nothing surprising.

“Step aside. I’m going to destroy this too.”

“Why? It’s so well-made! How could you make it like this? Did you mold it with silicone and then cast it with plaster?”

“No. It’s plaster cast from the start.”

“What-? It’s so detailed that I thought you made it with clay and then cast it with silicone. The material science professor would faint.”

“Nothing surprising. Both are similar methods. Now step aside.”

“They’re not similar at all! It’s absurd. Don’t destroy it. It’s too valuable...”

Despite Seo Yeon’s protests, Kang Lim grabbed a chisel and placed it on the sculpture without hesitation.

With a strong hit from the hammer, a cracking sound echoed.

Seo Yeon's face distorted in shock.

The once-whole sculpture shattered into fragments.

Pieces of the nose, ears, and lips fell off... Silence followed.

“It’s too smooth... Plaster...”

“What’s wrong? Are you hurt?”

“The world and life I’ve lived were not this smooth.”

“What are you going to do? The presentation is tomorrow.”

Muttering something incomprehensible, Kang Lim grabbed Seo Yeon’s shoulders and spoke.

“What if the subject is expressed from the material itself?”

“What do you mean?”

“I’ll have it completed by tomorrow morning. Don’t worry.”

With those words, Kang Lim ran out.

Left behind were the shattered sculpture and some plaster dust.

Just as one wouldn’t understand why a master potter destroys their work after decades, neither Shin Taemin nor Seo Yeon could understand Kang Lim.
