## Episode 57: An Unexpected Dinner

"Unnie, you seem excited? Or maybe anxious?"

Seohui looked at Seoyeon with a puzzled expression.

Her sister, who usually had a blank face and only studied, was unusually lively and fidgety today.

It was strange how she couldn't keep still.

However, Seoyeon shrugged her shoulders, removing her finger from her mouth.

"Me? No way."

Seoyeon spoke with a face that said it couldn't be true.

To Seohui's eyes, it seemed like Seoyeon was trying to brush off the situation as if it wasn't important.

"No! You look different. Could it be because the teacher is coming over later? We're having dinner together, remember?"

"What... no..."

"Unnie, you said he's a school friend."

"Yes."

"How did a school friend get introduced by your old tutor? The world is small."

"Yeah, I was surprised too at first."

"But, unnie, didn't you dislike revealing our family to others?"

"I did, but Kang Lim is different."

"Really? Why?"

In truth, Seoyeon was half excited and half anxious.

She was excited because she liked the idea of inviting Kang Lim for dinner.

She was anxious because she was worried it might seem like she had been hiding something.

Shin Taemin always called Seoyeon a deceiver, so her anxiety was stronger.

"...Kang Lim is someone who will eventually get to know our family anyway. It's fine."

"Is it because the teacher will be a sponsoring artist?"

"Yes, even if I hadn't met Kang Lim at school, we would have met eventually. His work is good. Heyum is the most famous art museum in Korea, and he would have held an exhibition there someday."

"True, the teacher is really good at drawing. But unnie, you talk like it's destiny!"

"It's not like that!"

Seohui covered her mouth with both hands and giggled.

It was the first time she saw her sister flustered.

"Unnie, but the teacher said he has a girl he likes."

"It's not like that."

"Anyway! I once tried to introduce someone to you, like Yoonki teacher, because I was worried someone might approach you. But he flatly refused, saying he already has someone he likes."

"...Really?"

"He said that person helps him a lot, and he had a warm smile on his face. He seems to be really into that person. The innocent teacher, it was so funny."

"Someone who helps him a lot?"

"Yes, he said it's a friend! Could it be your peer?"

Hearing Seohui's words, a smile crept across Seoyeon's face.

Somehow, she felt good, and her cheeks flushed.

Worried that Seohui might notice, Seoyeon quickly changed her expression to a cold one and went to the living room.

She wanted to help the housekeeper prepare a delicious dinner.

* * *

"Oh! Why are you outside?"

Kang Lim greeted Ryu Miyeon, who was standing at the front gate as he entered the garden.

Ryu Miyeon had a look of finally meeting someone she had been waiting for.

She seemed much happier than the first time they met.

"Welcome, Kang Lim. Let's talk over here."

Oh, there's a separate door to enter the dining room from outside.

Kang Lim entered through a large glass door with Ryu Miyeon.

"Oh, it's warm in here."

"Haha, yes, it is."

It was quite chilly in the fall evenings, but it quickly became warm inside.

The room was transparent, so he thought it would be cold, but the air seemed well insulated.

Looking outside, the twilight was falling on the grass that had been shining during the day.

The building looked mysterious at night.

"But why the sudden dinner... Did Seohui not do well on her exams?"

"No, thanks to you, she got perfect scores on her entrance exam drawings."

"Wow! Really? Haha, that's great."

Kang Lim felt proud that his lessons had been effective.

Ryu Miyeon liked Kang Lim's bright smile.

"But the reason I contacted you today is not because of Seohui. I wanted to ask if you could become a sponsoring artist for Heyum. Actually, I'm the director of the museum."

Ryu Miyeon handed her business card to Kang Lim as she spoke.

Kang Lim received the card but had to process what he had just heard.

It was such significant information delivered straight to the point.

"What?"

So, she is the daughter of the chairman of the Jeil Group.

The one who is always in the newspapers?

He knew they were wealthy, but he didn't realize they were this rich...

Kang Lim froze, unsure of what he had just heard.

His polite demeanor became awkward and clumsy, and Ryu Miyeon spoke with a gentle gaze.

"I'm sorry to bring this up so suddenly. But I was more surprised by your work than you are now. I really wanted to find an artist like you. We even lowered the age limit for this year's sponsoring artist to twenty because of you. We reviewed all the portfolios of other applicants, but there was no one like you."

"Ah..."

"I know it's overwhelming, but it's true. Your work was amazing."

"...Was it because of the portfolio and the actual piece I left behind?"

To think that he was confirmed as a sponsoring artist because of just one painting.

Kang Lim couldn't believe it.

In the art world, one good painting is never enough to convince.

The high age limit for sponsoring artists is to confirm whether the person has produced a substantial body of work.

Having many works is proof of a lifelong commitment to art.

Ryu Miyeon seemed to read Kang Lim's thoughts.

"It's not just because of that one work. Seoyeon saw all your works through a camera and told us about your talent. Even one work was enough to move me, but now I'm completely captivated."

"What? Seoyeon?"

"Yes, Seohui's unnie is Seoyeon."

The second piece of information threw Kang Lim into confusion.

It felt like taking multiple punches in succession, leaving him disoriented.

He slowly looked up at Ryu Miyeon, and her features overlapped with Seoyeon's.

The moment he first met Ryu Miyeon replayed in his mind.

The elegant and graceful atmosphere, it felt familiar and recognizable.

Then, the scene when he invited Seoyeon to his house and walked up the hill together replayed.

When he said the student he was going to tutor was named Seohui and that it was similar to her name, Seoyeon's frozen expression came to mind.

The words he said to Seoyeon also replayed.

On the first day of class, while eating kimchi fried rice.

[You want to become a curator and manage art? That's a tough path... The salary is low... Only those destined from birth do that...]

After setting up the busking stage, at the tteokbokki place.

[I'll buy everything from here to here. Just tell me.]

Oh my god. How embarrassing.

Kang Lim covered his eyes with his right hand.

The scenes that Seoyeon had laughed off were still vivid memories for Kang Lim.

"..."

Watching the silent Kang Lim, Ryu Miyeon spoke.

With a slightly bitter smile on her lips.

"She really doesn't like being in the spotlight. I hope you don't think too badly of her."

Kang Lim brushed his face with the hand that had covered his eyes.

Only a void remained in his eyes.

"Oh, no. Of course not... I don't think badly of her at all..."

Kang Lim decided to focus on Ryu Miyeon in front of him for now.

After all, she was someone he wanted to meet as an art professional.

He was just surprised by the unexpected truth, but he had thought he would meet her someday anyway.

As he composed himself, he quickly felt at ease.

"Once you become our sponsoring artist, you will stay at a residency in Paris, France. Of course, since you are still in school, you will only be there during breaks or if you take a leave of absence. During the semester, you will use a studio in Seoul."

"Oh, I see."

"Also, because your foreign language skills are excellent, I believe you can complete the residency program without an interpreter. Actually, we also consider language scores when selecting a sponsoring artist, but you don't need that."

Residencies provide living and exhibition spaces for artists, along with financial support and various programs.

The main goal is to create exhibitions with established artists and critics from around the world.

They also perform art activities needed in the local area.

For Kang Lim, who was looking for a studio, there was no reason to refuse.

"I'm grateful. As a student, it's unbelievable to have such an opportunity. Usually, students are not accepted into these programs because of many restrictions."

"That's why your work must be so good for me to go this far. You fully deserve this opportunity."

"Thank you."

"We're planning a solo exhibition at Heyum's Seoul gallery around the end of this semester, and another one in Paris during the break. Since you have a lot of works, it shouldn't be difficult. Seoyeon will help you a lot as well. She's young, but her experience is as extensive as that of a seasoned curator."

"Yes, I think so. Seoyeon is really diligent in everything she does. But is it common to hold a solo exhibition this quickly?"

"No, it's unusual. But you never know. You might need the experience."

"...?"

"After dinner, have a chat with Seoyeon. I feel a bit sorry for suddenly overwhelming you with so much information."

"No, it's fine."

"Let's go inside."

The sponsoring artist program is about receiving support, so there is no need to sign a contract.

Later, there will be an article announcing his selection for the Heyum residency program.

Kang Lim followed Ryu Miyeon.

As they passed through the spacious living room and arrived at the dining table, a savory smell tickled their noses.

In the rising steam, Seoyeon was visible.

* * *

After dinner, the two went out to the garden.

The wide yard, touched by a cold breeze, occasionally echoed with the sound of crickets.

Maybe because it was night, the scent of crushed grass was more pronounced under their feet.

Seoyeon looked up at Kang Lim while walking slowly.

Although he seemed to enjoy the food during the meal, he didn't say much.

He neither showed surprise nor excitement.

Nor was he dejected and weighed down.

He was just a bit quieter than usual.

Of course, Seoyeon liked that reaction. It felt manly, somehow.

But she was also worried.

Seoyeon glanced at him and grabbed his sleeve.

"Are you mad? You're too quiet."

Kang Lim looked at the white hand tugging at his sleeve.

The fingers peeking out from the cardigan seemed to be apologizing.

Seeing Seoyeon's gloomy face, he couldn't help but smile.

Seoyeon was Seoyeon, after all.

"No, why would I be mad? Why would I get mad at you?"

"Then why aren't you talking?"

"I'm waiting for you to talk."

"About what?"

"I told you how I lived my life. Now it's your turn."

"Well, I can't tell you everything... I'm not as special as you..."

What's this reaction?

Kang Lim found it a bit strange that Seoyeon was following him so slowly.

She usually had a sharp personality and always boosted his confidence, but today she seemed a bit down.

"Well, you don't have to tell me everything. I didn't tell you everything either."

"What? That's unfair. You said you told me everything before!"

So, I don't need to know, but you do?

Seoyeon, pulling a double standard, returned to her usual self.

Her clear voice echoed in Kang Lim's ears.

Delighted by the sudden change, Kang Lim spoke playfully.

His lips curved upwards on both cheeks.

"An artist should always keep some mystery. You understand. If there are secrets, there's more to research. I should keep some secrets that no one can ever find out, like Da Vinci."

"Ugh..."

Seoyeon booed and gave a thumbs down, making Kang Lim burst into laughter.

"Anyway, Kang Lim, congratulations on your solo exhibition at Baekyeon Gallery. It's really hard to get selected for that."

"Yeah, thanks. Many people have been congratulating me."

"That's as hard as becoming one of our sponsored artists."

"No way. Nothing compares to Heyum."

"No, the competition rates are similar. And the director there is a really great person. When he was young, he even organized the Venice Biennale."

"Oh, no wonder his questions were sharp."

"He taught me a lot when I was young. He'll definitely put on a fantastic exhibition for you."

Thinking about it, owning a gallery named after oneself is an incredible achievement.

Kang Lim looked forward to the solo exhibition curated by Ha Baekyeon.

He was curious about how well the foreword would reflect what he had said.

As Kang Lim imagined various things, Seoyeon suddenly approached him.

"Really, I'm so excited. How will people react when they find out it was painted when you were six? They’ll go crazy!"

Seoyeon grabbed Kang Lim's hand with an excited face.

She seemed happier than Kang Lim.

Kang Lim was flustered.

Before, she suddenly confessed her feelings.

Now she was grabbing his hand without warning.

She's unpredictable.

"I hope the world gets to know you soon!"

Kang Lim stood still, listening to Seoyeon's excited voice.

Her bright expression and flushed cheeks were cute.

Her bare skin under the moonlight.

Seeing her pure appearance, he wanted to caress her cheek.

"What? What's wrong?"

Kang Lim stared deeply into her eyes without blinking.

In the quiet night, only the slow, deep breaths were audible.

The tension in the air between them was palpable.

Maybe because it was dark.

Seeing the depth in Kang Lim's eyes, Seoyeon felt a bit shy.

But suddenly.

Kang Lim realized one thing.

If this continued, he would get kicked in the shin.

‘I'll get kicked soon. My poor shin.’

With that realization, Kang Lim tightly closed his eyes.

Automatically, his knee area twitched.

His body remembered the pain from before.

Seoyeon was stronger than she looked.

But...

Even as time passed, the same pain didn't occur.

"Follow me! I have something to show you."

Peeking through one eye, Kang Lim found himself running across the grass with Seoyeon.

He barely felt like he was running, his heart fluttering too much.

The small pulse in their still-held hands was palpable.

The scent of shampoo wafted from Seoyeon's flowing hair.

Seoyeon always turned his heart upside down.
