## Episode 80: The Legacy Left Behind

Although you may not be an avid mountain climber, anyone would visit the autumn mountains at least once.

Especially Bukhansan in the middle of the city, which has an enormous number of visitors.

Having a beautiful mountain in such an accessible place is a blessing.

The broad-leaved trees covering the large rocky mountain...

Seeing the leaves glittering in the sunlight makes one's heart flutter.

When you see the colorful autumn leaves blooming at the peak...

Undoubtedly, it’s a color that no painter could replicate.

However, today was a bit different.

People climbing towards the peak stopped midway up the mountain.

They should be going to see the natural, colorful clothes...

But a young man had halted everyone’s steps.

‘Indeed, there’s a subtle difference between seeing something in person and a memory... When I drew my mother, the one I drew at that spot when I was young felt more vivid.’

Kang Lim, with his keen visual sense, caught what others couldn’t.

He deeply engraved the words of Grandpa Song Gijeong in his heart when he was young.

[Always make a habit of sketching outdoors. Don’t rely too much on your memory.]

Looking at the breathtaking view, Kang Lim spread out his cloth.

While others brought water to drink, he poured it onto a paper plate.

Staring at the sky... he mixed his paints.

‘Peacock Blue, Prussian Blue, a small amount of Violet.’

He squeezed the paint in the ratio he wanted and spread it thickly on the cloth.

He mixed white to paint light clouds.

When he held the finished painting up to the sky, the cloth disappeared.

Because it exactly matched the current sky’s appearance and color.

“Oh my!”

“Oh my, oh my! What on earth is that?”

“It’s like seeing a ghost.”

People were watching Kang Lim from behind.

He looked like a culinary master who could identify all the ingredients in a dish.

How could he mix paints to achieve that color?

‘Nature is truly amazing... It embraces all colors. Even the same ginkgo tree has leaves with varying degrees of autumn colors... and the fallen leaves on the ground gradually losing their saturation over time is fascinating.’

Kang Lim couldn't hear the people's cheers.

He simply, without any change in expression, spread out a new cloth.

‘Permanent Red, Vermilion Hue, Burnt Umber, Burnt Sienna.’

He squeezed out the desired paints again and dabbed them on.

As the colors mixed slightly on the surface, autumn leaves appeared.

Even though he didn’t draw any specific shapes, everyone thought they were leaves.

After a while, when Kang Lim finished his work,

A pile of cloths had accumulated next to him.

Already 30 pieces. At this rate, it’s quick.

Because it’s just about mixing paints.

‘Although they are simple color fields, these pieces will create an effect of scattered landscapes in the exhibition. This will smoothly connect the different chapters.’

Kang Lim placed the dried cloths into a large drawing board.

He dusted off his bottom and stood up.

As the dust flew, people clapped their hands.

When Kang Lim looked back, his eyes widened.

At first, there weren’t so many people around.

“Are you a painter, sir?”

“…Yes?”

Kang Lim was surrounded by men in hiking clothes.

Oh dear, has he already become this famous...

He spoke with an embarrassed expression.

“Yes, I am... Kang Lim.”

“What? Your name is Kang Lim? That’s unique.”

Oh no, was that not it?

They must have just been curious about the painting.

Kang Lim felt a bit embarrassed.

“I’ll definitely remember the painter’s name!”

“Haha... Thank you. Please come to my exhibition if you hear about it later.”

“That sounds good! But, can I ask a favor?”

“What is it?”

“Can you take a photo of us? Just one shot with us sitting on that rock.”

“Oh, sure. Please pose.”

The men and women climbed onto the rock with excited expressions.

The square rock, with its indents from rainwater, looked comfortable to sit on.

“I’ll take it on the count of three.”

As the gathered people smiled broadly at Kang Lim’s cue,

“Kimchi!”

Click. The moment he pressed the button,

A good idea popped into Kang Lim’s head.

‘Damn, why didn’t I think of this before?’

Kang Lim returned the camera to the man and spoke with a grateful expression.

“Thank you so much! I’m glad I came to the mountain today. Thanks to you, I got a great idea!”

“What did I do?”

The man looked at Kang Lim with a bewildered expression.

Kang Lim bowed and left.

Carrying the large drawing board, he quickly descended the mountain...

Unfortunately, only one photo remained.

“No way, he really only took one shot...”

The man checked the camera.

As soon as he saw the photo, he wanted to sew up his mouth for just complaining.

The regret disappeared completely, as it was a magnificent photo.

“The composition is amazing! Everyone, come and see this! Quickly!”

Kang Lim returned home and quickly turned on his computer.

For the first time in a while, he started a modeling project using the ZBrush program.

‘The Whanki Museum also had this. There are always chairs for people to sit in the space where large artworks are displayed. To give them time to meditate quietly...’

Kang Lim thought of the rocks he encountered in Bukhansan.

Jokduri Rock, Skull Rock, Samo Rock, Duck Rock, Flat Rock...

And many other unnamed rocks.

‘Let’s keep the characteristics of the rocks but make them comfortable to sit on. Lower the height to avoid blocking the view. It shouldn’t interfere with the appreciation of the paintings.’

He reduced the height of the rocks and gradually refined them to be comfortable to sit on.

He added some straight elements to ensure they weren’t too bumpy with too many curves.

A virtual hand kneaded the virtual clay.

After a while, the completed shape...

It was a modern chair inspired by rocks.

‘It’s more important for it to be comfortable to sit on than to look exactly like a rock. In fact, since there’s no correct shape for rocks, people might think this looks more like a rock.’

Kang Lim examined the sculpture by rotating it 360 degrees.

He imagined how it would look if it were actually made and placed in the center of an exhibition hall.

The audience sitting on the rock, admiring the Bukhansan scenery.

‘If I attach a stone-textured sheet and add touches with acrylic, it will look even more realistic. It’ll feel like being in nature.’

Kang Lim downloaded the file in a small size and texted Seoyeon.

As soon as he sent the idea sketch, he received an immediate reply.

[Seoyeon: Wow! That’s amazing! I was just working on the chairs, but I’ll throw away that design. Rocks!]

[Kang Lim: But I think it will cost a lot to make.]

[Seoyeon: Don’t worry about that. Which company will you commission?]

[Kang Lim: The one I used before, Juyeong Juhyeong. Since I’ll be attaching sheets anyway, I’ll decide whether to use acrylic or composite wood based on the cost.]

[Seoyeon: Right. That’s the company that made the sculptures for Seoul, right?]

[Kang Lim: Yes. They can reproduce 99% of my designs.]

[Seoyeon: Great! I always thought they did an excellent job. Since machines can’t handle certain parts, people have to carve them bit by bit.]

[Kang Lim: Exactly. That’s why the 3D company is crucial.]

[Seoyeon: The boss will love it.]

Seoyeon was right.

Every company has a portfolio.

It’s always good for Juyeong Juhyeong to have a record of participating in the Hyewoom exhibition.

Kang Lim smiled with satisfaction.

Having received so much help, it was time to repay.

[Kang Lim: I plan to continue working with the boss in the future.]

The concert hall at the Seoul Arts Center.

The place where the orchestra sounds the most beautiful is undoubtedly the central block on the first floor.

If you are too close to the stage, certain instruments sound louder, and if you are too far, you can’t hear the delicate notes.

The place where all sounds harmoniously blend is the expensive seat.

‘Wow, listening to Matilda's performance from the royal seat... I'll just head home and sleep after this... sheer happiness.’

After adding 200 pieces to his work, Kang Lim decided to take a little break.

He had been climbing mountains whenever he had a moment and heading straight to the studio after classes.

It had been too long since he last went home.

“Wow-!”

When the world-renowned conductor, Simon Rattle, appeared, cheers erupted.

The members of the Berlin Philharmonic in black suits took their seats.

The dream orchestra. Famous for not easily recruiting members.

They have a principle of not recruiting soulless performers.

“Kyah-!”

When Matilda Arcell appeared, cheers and applause erupted again.

A world-class, legendary pianist. She always dressed simply.

Today she appeared in a black dress.

Is it because the protagonist is the music, not the performer?

Kang Lim liked her dress code.

His tired eyes sparkled open.

Thick brown eyebrows, coarse and bushy hair.

People who see Matilda for the first time say she looks like a witch.

In truth, it doesn’t matter if she’s a witch or an angel.

Everyone is certainly enchanted by her music.

Her mysterious blue eyes looked at the conductor.

The exchange of glances, a signal of trust.

The tense silence was broken by the sound of a whip-like percussion.

Crack- and her fingers began to fly.

[Ravel Piano Concerto in G Major - Allegrement]

The delicate piano melody chattered along with the piccolo. Like birds chirping in a sparkling forest.

The playful music reached its peak with Matilda’s glissando.

The unique technique of scratching the keys!

At the dazzling opening, people’s eyes sparkled.

‘Confident Ravel, before his debut in America... He must have wanted to show off a brilliant performance at the beginning. To captivate the audience at once.’

Soon, all the instruments overlapped, creating a rich melody.

The trumpet announcing the start of the fanfare signals the beginning of a festival.

It feels like dancing in a ballroom.

However, Ravel is a master of orchestration.

He draws various landscapes with different instruments.

One piece never concludes with just one image.

‘As if it never happened, the piano turns ominous. This part is so captivating.’

The oboe and bassoon joined the conspiracy.

It must have been a strange night when the ball was held, with lots of clouds...

Ravel maximizes the characteristic sounds of the instruments.

It’s like putting all the best ingredients in a dish.

There are really many cooks. Too many, even.

But the boat doesn’t go up the mountain.

It doesn’t feel excessive.

It’s so exquisitely done that it sends chills down your spine, placing the instruments at the right spots.

Kang Lim admired the sound Matilda produced.

Naturally, his whole body shivered with excitement.

‘You can hear the pizzicato of the violin being plucked from the piano, and feel the rich vibrations of the horn. There’s already an orchestra inside the piano. As if Ravel were handling the instruments...’

Though only the first movement had ended, he almost clapped for the perfect performance.

Of course, he didn’t.

The reason Kang Lim loved this piece was for the second movement.

‘Why is it that all beautiful pieces are the second movement? Every composer writes the first and third movements just to write the main course, the second movement.’

This was a joke Kang Lim made up.

But he thought that if anyone listened to the second movement of this piece, they might agree with him.

* * *

[Ravel Piano Concerto in G Major - Adagio Assai]

‘In the first movement, there are very occasional gloomy melodies.’

Maybe it’s a foreshadowing for the second movement.

To transition perfectly from a lively atmosphere to restrained sorrow...

Matilda started the solo.

Usually, a concerto solo makes you think of a fast cadenza showing off the performer’s technique.

But this piece starts with endlessly simple notes.

In an honest 3/4 time.

It’s filled with empty spaces.

More important than the notes is playing the empty spaces.

With only the lyrical piano melody remaining on stage, her skill was fully revealed.

‘Matilda is the best. This piece feels different depending on the performer, and this tempo is my favorite.’

She produced a sound full of flavor, like a true French.

Yet, it was never greasy or heavy, always sweet.

Matilda shaped each note into a perfect circle.

Like a loving mother embracing her child...

The clear notes began to roll gently.

The sobbing tonguing of the flute was added, followed by the entrance of the oboe and clarinet.

‘All instruments with a sad voice... A true classical fan would have no choice but to cry...’

Tears naturally welled up in the eyes of the audience.

They had to try not to cry.

Because the sound of sniffles shouldn’t echo in the hall.

Is this the last night a mother and child spend together?

A deep sadness flowed throughout the piece.

But it wasn’t filled with regret for life.

It felt like a comforting embrace saying everything would be okay...

As the delicate and gentle trill repeated, the piece slowly faded away.

Was it a coincidence?

At the last note, the dynamics of all the string instruments and the piano matched perfectly.

Kang Lim closed his eyes.

Following the melody, an endless horizon was drawn.

Just before dawn.

It felt like standing between life and death.

‘This is why people come to concerts instead of listening to recordings... This is music you can only hear at this very moment.’

They say art makes a moment eternal.

In contrast, music is always alive, and it disappears the moment it is played.

It penetrates deeply into people’s hearts.

It’s heartbreaking and poignant...

Artists often feel jealous in front of musicians.

Jealousy is a good material. Sometimes it brings about genius ideas.

In Kang Lim’s mind, a thousand puzzle pieces were already being reassembled.

The first movement, the second movement, the third movement...

The pieces mixed together and varied in many ways.

‘How about if the exhibition changes slowly over the five months? At the opening ceremony, we could perform for the visitors who come to the exhibition that day.’
