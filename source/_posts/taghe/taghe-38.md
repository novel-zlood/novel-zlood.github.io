## Episode 38: You Reap What You Sow

Lee Hyerim was writing the final report to be submitted to the Seoul city government at the agency office.

First, she compared photos of the area before and after the installation, where there had been a small cliff before the stairs.

Previously, cigarette butts and gum were stuck in the corner, but now the neatly arranged stairs were designed to fit the terrain.

Of course, she added some adjustments to make the difference between before and after more noticeable.

Next, she detailed the planning intent behind Kang Lim's sculptural work themed around the summer festival and its impact on environmental improvement.

She also attached photos of the work that Seoyeon had sent.

The sound was shaking her entire body.

An electrifying thrill, as if electricity was flowing through her.

The photos captured the vividness of the performance, enough to make one's heart race.

Amid the crowd, the canopy designed by Kang Lim stood out.

‘The detail shots are nice, but this photo is truly impressive. Capturing the moment when sunlight creates an angelic ring through the canopy... It's much better than the journalist's photos.’

Taking this opportunity, Lee Hyerim decided to attach some articles to the final report.

There were many posts online, so she had to pick the best ones.

[Complete Freedom for the Youth Gathered Here. A New Busking Stage Design]

[The Image Green Brings: Comfort and Harmony, an Astonishing Sculpture that Seems to Bring Nature Directly]

[Is This Work, Which Captures Changing Light and Colors, Trash?]

After Seong Woojin's performance, the internet portal sites went wild.

Though performances continued, the opening day of the exhibition was particularly shocking to people and became widely known.

Initially, videos started spreading one by one on Facebook...

The rumor grew exponentially, and now it topped the search rankings.

‘Hongdae Busking is the number one search keyword. It has become more of a sensation than Sensation Agency itself…’

Sensation Agency's work also stirred much controversy.

The difference this year was that articles compared it with Kang Lim's work.

Thus, all the opposing issues could be absorbed.

[Meaningful Sculpture vs. Trashy Work Chasing Trends]

Clicking on the headline revealed many comments.

- There are many nuisance statues, but this one is worse.

- They really set up trash.

- Today, more tax money is wasted like this...

- The comparison between the two is stark, tsk tsk.

‘This year, on-site voting will be reflected… Even without seeing it, we’ll win.’

Lee Hyerim finished the report and looked back.

Han Jungpil was coldly reviewing other projects.

Always given only small projects, Lee Hyerim couldn’t even dream of touching those.

Seeing the empty desk next to her made her feel empty inside.

Hong Yunki was eventually fired after this project.

Why didn't they fire him earlier if they were going to make him pick up trash in his last project?

Lee Hyerim felt a bit resentful towards the professor.

Since they were both underperformers, she felt a sense of camaraderie with Hong Yunki.

Sensing her sharp gaze, Han Jungpil looked up and asked.

“Are you done?”

“Yes…”

“You designed the chair, right? You did well. I think you learned a lot working with Kang Lim.”

At his stiff tone, Lee Hyerim finally asked with a sharp voice.

“Professor, no matter what, I’m much more senior. Saying I learned from him feels a bit off. I’m about 10 years older than Kang Lim.”

Han Jungpil chuckled and said.

“I know you can handle more programs, Hyerim. But you couldn’t create the design I wanted. That’s why I introduced Kang Lim to you.”

“What exactly do you want?”

“Yunki and you always think about money. How to expand this business and win against that agency.”

“Isn’t that what a design company wants?”

At her retort, Han Jungpil slightly furrowed his brow and said.

“That’s a misconception about design. It’s not all about money. Design is ultimately for people. Hyerim, you often become one-dimensional because you're blinded by unnecessary goals.”

“…”

“Instead of thinking about how to help people, you think about how to gain more profit first. That’s why your designs lack both practicality and aesthetics.”

Lee Hyerim was taken aback by his words.

She recalled all the times when she first met Hong Yunki and Kang Lim.

Encouraging sexualized works like Sensation Agency to win architectural sculpture projects.

Suggesting large sculptures or murals without considering the characteristics of busy commercial areas, just for the sake of creating a buzz.

In hindsight, all those ideas were ridiculous, but she said them like a fool, thinking only about winning.

“Even smart people become fools if their brains are clouded by greed.”

“…”

“You have good technical skills. Look at the stairs you made this time. You designed them perfectly to match the terrain, considering people’s foot fatigue. If you weren’t meticulous, someone might have tripped over the protruding end of the stairs. You’re different from Yunki. You have the potential to change.”

Lee Hyerim asked in a lowered voice, lacking confidence.

“Then why didn’t you fire Yunki earlier? You almost fired him for not being able to paint when you called him for coloring. So why did you assign this project to him?”

Han Jungpil adjusted his square-framed glasses and answered.

“It was just to test Kang Lim. Maybe it wasn’t even necessary.”

“What kind of test…”

Han Jungpil recalled the numerous people who had flattered him.

He could win sculpture projects if he wanted, so there were many people willing to give him dirty favors with sweet words.

Han Jungpil was fed up with such people.

People who offered meaningless tributes instead of skill.

So he had never recommended an artist.

“Kang Lim said he wanted to work for people from the beginning, and I wanted to see if he was sincere. Yunki would have been obvious. He would’ve begged to do a shoddy job, claiming he could win a multi-billion won sculpture project. Right?”

“…”

“You know, in this field, there are plenty of people with PhDs. There are even more people who studied abroad. But finding a truly good person is like picking stars in the sky. If Kang Lim were also a materialist, he would’ve followed Yunki’s words to quickly succeed in a small unnoticed project and win a big profitable one. But you know better than anyone that he didn’t.”

Lee Hyerim finally noticed the new project materials Han Jungpil was holding.

The Songdo New Town Sculpture Project.

“No way! Professor, are you going to entrust the sculpture for ArtRevival Park to Kang Lim? Do you know how much that’s worth…”

“It’s not public yet, but I’ve become the Public Art Advisory Committee Chairman. It’s my job to recommend someone. And I already know Kang Lim’s sculptural modeling skills. It doesn’t feel burdensome at all.”

“What? You became the Advisory Committee Chairman?”

Lee Hyerim was stunned by the unexpected news.

“There’s nothing wrong with finding a talented and pure new artist. Besides, ArtRevival has a long way until completion.”

“…”

Lee Hyerim realized why she had always been given unnoticed small projects.

She had lost the pure heart she had when she first started art.

People were gathered under the canopy designed by Kang Lim.

When there was no busking, they would gather and admire the work.

“So, the title of the work is Kang Lim, using the characters for river (江) and forest (林), right?”

“Wow, are you a genius? That seems to be the meaning.”

“Oh! No wonder. The colors of the work feel so refreshing.”

‘It’s just my name… Is this the sorrow of being unknown?’

Kang Lim sat on the busking chair, waiting for Lee Hyunseong and Shin Tae-min.

He had been pondering what to name his work, thinking that citizens might come up with a good name if he stayed still... But it seemed a misunderstanding was beginning.

“Hey, we're here. Have this.”

When he turned around at the cold touch of an ice cream bag on his cheek, he saw Lee Hyunseong with an ice cream in his mouth.

“Have you seen this? It’s hilarious.”

Lee Hyunseong, laughing, handed his phone to Kang Lim as soon as he arrived.

[Kang Lim (江林) Standing Tall in Front of Hongdae.]

“…The article came out like this.”

Fortunately, someone had corrected it in the top comment.

-Reporter, do some research. That’s the artist's name…

“Long time no see.”

Shin Tae-min greeted briefly and sat on the busking chair.

Kang Lim looked at Shin Tae-min with curious eyes.

He didn’t expect him to come since the photos of the work were already all over the news.

Still, seeing this, he’s a surprisingly kind guy.

Lee Hyunseong, as if reading Kang Lim’s mind, said.

“Tae-min acts cold, but he’s soft on the inside. If you call him, he comes like a pet cat.”

“…”

Shin Tae-min didn’t respond to Lee Hyunseong’s words.

He just admired the newly created sculpture.

Kang Lim, eating a soda-flavored ice cream, asked Shin Tae-min.

“But aren’t you having any?”

“Oh, the work is cool.”

Shin Tae-min took out a cigarette from his pocket.

He put a cigarette in his mouth and stared at the sculpture with a weary look.

Seeing this, Lee Hyunseong said with a slightly flustered face.

“Hey, are you crazy? Don’t smoke here. I’m a non-smoker.”

“…I’ll just hold it in my mouth.”

Did he smoke? Were his dark circles always this deep?

Kang Lim tilted his head, watching the almost lifeless guy.

Somehow, he overlapped with Seoyeon, who had been drinking last night.

These two people seemed to have a bit of a shadow for some reason.

Seoyeon was less so than Shin Tae-min because of her bright expression.

“What are you doing these days to look so dead?”

“Drawing.”

“Where?”

“School.”

It’s very easy to distinguish between a diligent art student and one who is not.

If they come to school during vacation, they are at least students who intend to continue working.

“You must be bored without me next to you. I’m planning to prepare for a solo exhibition after this ends.”

“…? I liked having more space.”

Lee Hyunseong, chuckling, joined their conversation.

“Why hasn’t there been any contact from Korial Fresh? Didn’t your team get any contact, Tae-min? Usually, they notify the winners around this time.”

“If Sun Chae-won noona hasn’t said anything, it seems like we didn’t get it.”

“Huh, I see.”

Buzz--

At that moment, Kang Lim’s phone rang.

It was an unknown number, and he hesitated to answer, but Lee Hyunseong’s words made him feel like he should.

Strangely feeling good, he pressed the call button, and a woman's unfamiliar voice came through.

[Hello, this is Korial Fresh. We’re calling to ask about your participation in the contest award ceremony.]
