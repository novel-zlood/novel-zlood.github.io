## Episode 79: Stacking and Gathering.

The special exhibition hall, where the exhibition had ended, was empty.

The installation team was discussing the slope of the curved surface in the exhibition hall.

Kang Lim meticulously checked the 3D drawings from various angles and said:

"This looks good. With this, the paintings won't lift off the wall."

"Then we'll produce the partition wall as it is, fit it into the corners, and fill the gaps with paint. In two weeks, it will transform into a circular exhibition hall."

"Wow, as expected of Heyum. You guys implement things really fast."

"Well, the sketch was so good. It wasn't a difficult task."

"Thank you."

The Heyum that Kang Lim had drawn during class was handed over to the planning team as it was.

Though it was a drawing made with markers on a whiteboard, it was clearer than any concept art.

The installation team seemed to be having fun doing something different than just dividing square sections all the time.

"Kang Lim! I brought the artworks you mentioned. There's a lot, even though I didn't bring everything."

Seoyeon had moved the artworks.

They were trying to display them in advance before starting the partition wall construction.

"Thanks. Let's start by attaching one chapter and see how it looks."

Kang Lim shot a 3D laser pointer at the wall.

The red laser light drew a horizontal line across the large exhibition hall.

After adjusting the appropriate height, he marked it with a pencil.

"I thought this was an abstract work at first."

Seoyeon came over to Kang Lim and unfolded a piece of the painting.

It was so big that she had to stretch out both her arms to unfold it completely.

"Well, you could see it that way. If you look at just one piece, it just looks like a cloth with smeared colors."

"It's much bigger than I thought... If one piece is this big, won't the exhibition hall be too small?"

"No, the sizes of the pieces vary. I only matched the vertical ratio of the whole painting."

"Only the vertical...?"

"Yes, the vertical width is 120 ho. I just cut the same cloth into different rectangles, so there are smaller pieces."

"Ah! So that's why you set up a 120 ho canvas next to the laser point."

"Yes, that's right. Just stick them in order from the top line that I marked. If you look at the back of the painting, you'll see numbers like 1-1, 1-2, 1-3."

"Then let's quickly put them together, I'm curious."

Seoyeon brought a ladder and set it up next to the wall.

"Ah, no, I'll do it now. Seoyeon, you stand back and see if the height I set is okay, if it's comfortable for people to view while walking."

"Oh... okay."

As Seoyeon stepped back, Kang Lim climbed up the ladder.

He quickly climbed up, fixed only the top row, and then came down.

With an indifferent expression, he swiftly put the pieces in place.

"How is it? I only attached one chapter."

"......"

As Seoyeon stared at the painting...

Intense sunlight streamed in from the right sky.

The bold brushstrokes seemed to tear through the canvas.

The brown fragments that filled the screen gathered to form a majestic cliff.

A sharp cliff that sloped down from the top left.

Its strong shape was overwhelming to the viewer.

The powerful brushstrokes whipped across the cracked granite, as if showing the years of enduring snow, rain, and wind.

"Is the height okay?"

"Yeah......"

Not only Seoyeon but also the installation team gathered.

Everyone observed the painting intently, not even blinking.

Contrary to Kang Lim’s nonchalant expression, the artwork left them speechless.

Perhaps he should have given them time to be amazed.

Kang Lim chuckled and said:

"It's Bukhansan. It's a bit early to be surprised. This is the smallest chapter."

"......"

"I captured only the scenic spots from all the trails. There are so many stunning places that it makes you want to draw a huge picture. It's a shame I couldn't paint it as a whole because my house is small, so I painted it in pieces."

"Oh my... Did you paint only what you saw while hiking?"

"Of course! The difference between a photo and the actual mountain is huge. The memory of eating kimbap with my father at the summit is still the best."

"Your father must like hiking."

"Yes, he loves it. Since we lived in Bulgwang-dong, we often went hiking for exercise. We used to go almost every weekend until I entered college, but I've been too busy since then."

"...How long did it take to make?"

"From the summer vacation of my first year in middle school to the summer vacation of my third year in high school."

"Ha... You're really something..."

"My thighs are amazing."

"What are you saying all of a sudden! Ridiculous."

Seoyeon squinted her eyes, and Kang Lim burst into laughter.

That guy always jokes whenever he gets the chance.

Seoyeon approached the painting to examine the materials.

The thick paint and the intense, rough brushstrokes.

It felt powerful because it was the largest of Kang Lim’s works.

The mighty force of nature...

"Why is the cloth so thick?"

"I get my cloth from Dongdaemun Market, and the 'premium canvas' sold by the lady at my regular store is the best. It’s written in Korean like that, but it's rough like hemp. But it's not thin and has a sturdy texture."

Seoyeon burst into laughter at the pronunciation of 'premium canvas.'

"Haha. No wonder even the base is different. The thick material is good because it doesn't lift even without a separate frame. It has a good weight."

"…But, doesn’t it feel awkward because the pieces don’t fit perfectly?"

Seoyeon stepped back again and looked at the painting.

Only then did she realize that the pieces didn’t fit perfectly.

Kang Lim's painting was subtly misaligned.

"Oh? It really is."

"Should I adjust it a bit?"

"No, no. It's actually cooler because of that. It felt strangely scratched, maybe because of the misalignment. It’s quite painterly."

"Really? Then that's a relief."

"The height is also perfect as it is now. Let’s fix it like this."

"Okay."

Seoyeon looked around the large exhibition hall and then at Kang Lim.

It was the first time she felt that even Heyum was insufficient for this guy.

"No matter how I look at it, the exhibition hall seems too small. We’ve only attached 16 pieces..."

"Hmm, really? That won't do... I plan to add 200 more pieces. If we’re doing it, it should be neat with a total of 1,000 pieces."

"…What do you mean? The opening is around the second week of December, how will you add 200 more pieces?"

"I have my ways. I’ll have to go to the mountains again after a long time."

Kang Lim shrugged his shoulders.

Seoyeon felt a bit worried about his confidence.

The painting created now was impressive, but the mountain looked dangerous.

She was concerned he might get hurt while rushing the work.

Moreover, the leaves are slippery in autumn.

"But, you... You’re not hiking dangerous trails, right? How do you get such angles of the cliffs? The rocks look a bit strange."

Kang Lim flinched.

It was because he enjoyed hiking slightly dangerous trails.

The steep ridge sections were thrilling.

"Haha. Your expression looks similar to my mom's right now. But, Bukhansan is like that. It's originally full of rocks. You climb holding onto the railings."

"Don't go to strange places and stick to the hiking trails! Or you can draw from memory. Don’t climb up."

But those are also hiking trails...

He seemed to understand why his father started choosing only gentle trails after hearing his mother’s nagging.

Kang Lim nodded and said:

"Um... okay, got it."

"Are you sure? You could hurt your hand."

"Yeah..."

Seoyeon approached the pouting Kang Lim.

Though she felt suspicious since he was avoiding eye contact, she had no choice but to trust him.

"But why are you trying to add 200 more pieces?"

"After the partition wall construction is finished and we attach everything, there might be not enough paintings. Also, adding 200 more pieces will help connect each chapter smoothly."

"…Well, I'm sure you have it all figured out. Just do it safely."

"Yes."

"Is there anything else you need?"

Kang Lim's method involved going to the place, reconstructing it in a sketch, and then transferring it at home.

Though he had tried attaching the completed pieces on the rooftop, there were some large works that couldn’t be attached on the rooftop.

"I've only attached it in my head, so there are many pieces whose actual alignment I'm not sure of. If the pieces are too misaligned, I might have to adjust them here."

"Then I'll lay plastic on the floor. After the construction is finished, install it and draw here."

"Okay, thanks."

"Anything else?"

Kang Lim looked at the painting he had just hung up.

This time, the pushpins were bothering him.

"The exhibition hall wall is like a sponge (exaggerating a bit), so pushpins go in well."

"That's how all museum walls are... They need to take tacks easily."

"Yes. But the pushpin heads are too big. I want smaller, transparent pushpins, preferably matte."

"Oh, they bother you because they look like dots?"

"Yes."

"I'll make them, don’t worry."

"Do you know how to use 3D programs?"

"I can do basic stuff. I'm good at 2D."

"Wow... that's reassuring."

"I'll also finalize the concept for the catalog and leaflet soon and get your confirmation. Look forward to it."

Thinking about it, Seoyeon's fairy tale book was structurally solid.

Though the content was ordinary, she handled the programs well fundamentally.

Kang Lim said with a smile:

"Let's create the best exhibition."

"Sure, perfect!"

Kang Lim held out his palm to Seoyeon.

It was a high-five request.

Seoyeon smiled and placed her small hand over his.

The sound of their hands clapping echoed.

Kang Lim returned to the residency.

He needed to meet the deadline for the Korean Art Exhibition application today.

'Let's finish this and focus solely on the solo exhibition.’

As he turned the corridor, he saw a familiar figure.

A man with long bobbed hair. Ryu Junhee was standing in front of the residency room entrance.

As soon as Ryu Junhee saw Kang Lim, he handed over a ticket.

"You're here. This is a gift."

"Huh, what's this?"

Kang Lim checked the shiny ticket.

Matilda Arcel. The name of a world-renowned pianist was written on it.

The seat was the best R seat, costing over 300,000 won.

He had heard about her upcoming performance with the Berlin Philharmonic, but the cheaper seats had sold out quickly, so he couldn’t get a ticket.

To think he got one like this...

Seeing Kang Lim's moved expression, Ryu Junhee chuckled.

"You inspired me, so I should help you a bit too."

"Wow, how did you know I like her?"

"I noticed you sometimes play classical music while you work."

"Do you listen to classical music often too?"

"Isn’t it a basic? The history of music goes hand in hand with art. Seeing your refined taste in music, you seem to have all the sophistication of the rich."

"No, not really. I listen to everything from classical to rock."

"Well, anyway. Just as Nam June Paik got inspired by John Cage's performance, you never know what inspiration you might get. Meet a first-class performer, experiencing the best is important."

"Wow... thank you."

"No problem. Have you submitted for the contest?"

"I’m about to."

"Do well. The description of the work is important."

"That's a given."

Kang Lim grinned as he opened the studio door.

* * *

Kang Lim turned on his laptop and opened his email.

Seoyeon had sent photos of <Snow Bamboo> taken in the studio.

After downloading the files and checking them carefully, he nodded.

"Good, it subtly reveals the hidden intention. Not sure if the judges will catch it, but it's interesting."

He accessed the Korean Art Exhibition website and downloaded the contest submission documents.

He filled out the personal information while checking the blank spaces.

He filled in the sections for the title, size, materials, and production year of the work.

The most important part was the last section.

The part where he explains the production intention.

Art contests are similar to class presentations.

One must know how to explain their work impressively.

This part greatly affects the score.

'Whether it was Seodoh Ho or Kim Whanki, they were all Korean in spirit, despite different materials.'

To Kang Lim, being Korean was not about the materials.

It was about what the artist tried to convey from deep within their heart... that spirit was important.

'Nevertheless, I used traditional materials. That’s the reason for my production intention.'

Kang Lim slowly began writing the artist's note.

[Ink wash cannot erase what has passed, just like life.

The dried ink leaves an even darker mark the more one tries to cover it.

I didn't draw a perfect gradient in one go.

Instead, I observed the lines being redrawn as I layered ink.

As the ink dried and accumulated, when I looked back...

I realized that a stroke I thought was a mistake turned out to be a beautiful change in the whole work.

It wasn’t necessary to find the perfect paper, gradient, or speed.

The time drawn on the painting was beautiful.

The firmness of bamboo is said to resemble a gentleman's will.

Even if it sways, it never breaks.

But...

If a gentleman rises with all the trials and tribulations, does it have to be drawn in one go?

I accepted all the elements that make up oneself, layering thin ink on top of thick gesso.

The background, on the contrary, was made to spread without brush marks by mixing glue.

Amidst a clean and pretty background, stands bamboo with hundreds of touches.

Upholding its lofty integrity alone.]

Kang Lim attached the image file and completed the document submission.

After hitting the enter button, a window popped up indicating the application was completed.

Now, he just needed to send the actual painting for the second screening.

The result was in their hands.
