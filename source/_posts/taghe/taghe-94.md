## Episode 94: First Impressions

Île de la Cité, an island where the Seine River splits through Paris.

As soon as they arrived, a massive stone building came into view.

"Wow... It's really extravagant. I heard it took 200 years to build and carve this."

Kang Lim looked up at the sharply pointed spire. It was so tall it seemed to touch the sky, appearing majestic.

Notre-Dame Cathedral, with its H-shaped symmetrical structure centered around the bell tower.

Though construction began in the 12th century, it was incredibly delicate and sturdy.

Kang Lim approached closer and examined the sculptures of figures carved on the building's surface.

From life-sized human figures to angels as small as a forearm... they were depicted as if they were mounted on the building’s walls.

As Kang Lim tried to memorize the entire structure, he shivered when he saw a statue of Saint Denis holding his severed head.

"Ugh... So, this is the famous first pilgrim."

At that moment, when his eyebrows were furrowing involuntarily, Seo Yeon’s voice was heard.

"Kang Lim, stand next to it!"

"Oh, okay."

Seo Yeon crouched down almost to the floor.

Looking through the lens, she captured Kang Lim's image in the camera.

Holding a bunch of phone cards and picture postcards bought at Place de la Concorde, he smiled brightly. His expression was so cute that it made her laugh.

"Isn't it usually the other way around? It seems like the roles are reversed."

Ryu Joon-hee shook his head as he watched the two of them.

After a flight, you should only walk around a bit and rest. Maybe it's because they are young, but it's tiring to hang out with them.

Seeing both of them excited and enjoying the sightseeing made him sigh.

"These energetic kids don't even seem to feel the cold."

Eventually, Ryu Joon-hee ignored the sound of the camera shutter clicking and came into the frame.

Ignoring Seo Yeon’s request to move aside, he spoke to Kang Lim with a stern expression.

"Let’s stop wandering around now."

"...What? We haven't even seen the inside of the cathedral yet. Since we're here, let's go inside."

"Ugh. We can see that later! Everything in Paris is close by, so we can just drop by when we pass. Did you think I brought you here just to show you that?"

"Then why did we come here?"

"The important part is the top. Once you see that, you’ve seen all of Paris."

"But we have to see the sparkling stained glass inside..."

"Quiet! Seo Yeon, come quickly too."

Seo Yeon followed behind as Kang Lim was being dragged away.

"Uncle, are we going up the bell tower?"

"Yeah. Once you see it, your sightseeing is complete."

"Haha. The view from the top is indeed amazing."

Ryu Joon-hee handed the two of them the museum passes he had pre-purchased.

"With these, you don't need to buy tickets at the ticket booth. They include museums like the Louvre, Orsay, Pompidou, and Orangery, as well as cathedrals."

Kang Lim admired the free pass ticket.

Even without it, the lines at tourist spots were so long that it took an hour just to buy a ticket. It was a great item.

"Wow. How much is this? I should have bought it sooner."

"You can buy it for 40,000 won. It's valid for several weeks, so it's worth it. You just have to line up at the entrance, so it's convenient."

"Thanks for the great tip."

"Sure. Later, if there's something you want to see, explore it on your own."

"Okay."

The three of them entered through the door on the left side of the cathedral.

A guide standing at the entrance handed out leaflets explaining the history of Notre-Dame.

Seeing that it was translated into Korean too, it was clear that many tourists visit here.

* * *

A spiral staircase that twists and turns. How long has it been since they entered? Kang Lim felt like he was becoming a snail.

It was too narrow for an adult male, but he couldn't rest while climbing, as tourists endlessly surged up from below. It was a setup where a large person would be cursed if they got stuck.

Except for occasional small windows, it was a completely isolated space from the outside.

Kang Lim wondered if Seo Yeon, who lacked stamina, was climbing well... It was dizzying enough that it was surprising she could keep walking. He questioned why he was enduring this hardship, even though there wasn't a hunchback cleaning the bell at the top.

Then, a cold wind blew in.

After passing the creaking wooden stairs, they reached the top.

"Wow..."

The cityscape of Paris unfolded like a map before his eyes, making his mouth drop open.

The toy-like small houses, the Eiffel Tower rising among them... all shining like stars.

It was a wonderful scene befitting the name "City of Light."

Kang Lim took out a postcard from his pocket and matched the picture. It was undoubtedly taken from here.

"Ha. Isn’t it amazing?"

Ryu Joon-hee, who arrived late, spoke to Kang Lim.

It had been tough, but seeing the awestruck expression on his face, he was glad he brought him.

"Yes... it's really amazing."

"The view of Paris from here is the best. You can even see the Eiffel Tower."

"It's better than the Eiffel Tower's observation deck."

"That's right. But do you know this?"

"Know what?"

"The Eiffel Tower, now a symbol of Paris, was initially met with protests for demolition."

"Oh, I know. People criticized it as a hideous structure. At that time, it was the tallest building in the world and had an unprecedented iron structure, so it was shocking."

"Exactly. That's what I wanted to say. Geniuses ahead of their time eventually face moments of conflict with people."

Ryu Joon-hee said, taking out a cigarette from his pocket.

"You'll face such moments too. You're the most genius person I've ever seen."

"Hmm...?"

"Really. That's why sometimes I feel anxious when I see you."

"About what?"

"That you'll get hurt trying to always communicate with the audience. Artists are usually so self-centered that they don't care much about what people say, but I feel you might get deeply hurt if someone doesn't understand your work. You might face a major slump."

Ryu Joon-hee chewed on the cigarette without lighting it.

Glancing sideways, he saw Kang Lim smiling slightly.

He had expected a serious expression, but it was surprisingly different.

"Haha. You worry about the strangest things. I’m not that fragile."

"Really?"

Kang Lim pointed at the long rows of buildings and roads, drawing lines as he spoke.

"Paris is the city most loved by people."

"What’s with the sudden statement?"

"Do you know why Paris is so charming?"

"...That's obvious. It retains the exterior of the elegant buildings built in the 19th century, making it exotic. It preserved the places where famous artists and philosophers gathered, so it's romantic."

"That's true. But the important thing is not the buildings but the roads."

"Right. Unlike our country, which is divided into square plots, it's unique."

"Yes. Buildings radiate out from the Arc de Triomphe in a radial pattern, spreading the lights like a spider web. The non-uniform road design makes a clear difference from other countries that usually have rectangular roads."

"That's why the night view is beautiful."

Gargoyles guarding the roof to ward off evil spirits.

Kang Lim looked down at the city with the winged demon.

The night breeze wiped the sweat from his forehead, making his chest flutter.

"This beautiful road design was conceived by Baron Haussmann."

"Yes. Napoleon III wanted to make Paris the most magnificent city."

"But the real reason was to prevent citizens' rebellions. It was designed to ensure they could never set up barricades again."

Kang Lim closed one eye and measured the width of the road with his fingers as he spoke.

"Blocking all the wide roads spreading in all directions and trying to start a revolution while avoiding surveillance is difficult. Napoleon feared the citizens more than enemy nations because he seized the throne through a coup."

Kang Lim pointed towards the Louvre Museum.

"The Louvre is the same. How many artifacts from other countries are displayed there? They all pretend to be French cultural assets... In a way, it's a symbol of imperialism."

This time, he showed several postcards.

Kang Lim's fingers pointed out each location one by one.

"Place de la Concorde, which we saw earlier, was built wide to showcase guillotine executions, and the beautiful Sacré-Cœur Basilica in Montmartre was erected to cover up the massacre of the Paris Commune, a coalition of unarmed citizens and workers."

"......"

Ryu Joon-hee's breath, visible in the cold air, drifted past Kang Lim’s view. The dazzling city alternated between blurring and coming into focus.

Kang Lim squinted and continued speaking.

“So… I know. What people like, what looks beautiful isn’t everything. When you try to deal with invisible truths, you might end up with forms that are hard to understand.”

“......”

“But, many people know this too. That’s why they keep trying to communicate. I believe there’s a clear difference between works made just for self-appeasement and those created with the intent to communicate with the audience till the end. Of course, you can’t satisfy everyone, but over time, the value will become evident.”

Ryu Joon-hee looked at Kang Lim in silence, and without realizing it, his posture became more respectful.

Was this the same kid who was grinning earlier? His serious expression seemed surprisingly new.

What was this kid seeing ahead in the future?

Although there was nothing more to advise him on, Ryu Joon-hee felt he had worried unnecessarily.

Overwhelmed by Kang Lim’s brilliance, he changed the subject to avoid revealing his inner thoughts.

“Ahem. So, what are your first impressions of Paris?”

“Excuse me?”

“If you were to describe it in one sentence?”

Kang Lim scratched his head at the sudden question.

Ryu Joon-hee’s breath continued to form white puffs in the cold air.

With a cigarette in his mouth, it looked like smoke, even though it wasn’t.

“…The smell of cigarettes from a blonde Asian?”

Ryu Joon-hee burst into laughter at Kang Lim’s answer.

Pleasant wrinkles formed around his eyes.

"That's an excellent answer."

* * *

Kang Lim returned to the lodging. The current time was 10 PM. The security guard was still at the lobby even at the late hour.

Though it was usual, Kang Lim felt awkward, thinking it was because of him.

"Hello. Thank you for your hard work. I’m sorry for coming back so late."

"No problem. You are Mr. Kang Lim, right? Your luggage is here."

"Yes. Thank you."

Receiving his stored suitcase, he climbed the stairs.

Each step up was filled with the warm air of the building.

Seo Yeon followed Kang Lim and handed him the key from her pocket.

"Wow. Your French pronunciation is really good."

"Well, this much is nothing."

Kang Lim shrugged his shoulders.

Though he said that, speaking was like practicing muscles, so it took a long time.

Seo Yeon pointed to the end of the hallway on the second floor.

"That's the communal shower room. As you know, the studio shouldn't be damp, so it's separate. The cooking area is on the first floor, so you can have breakfast there. Your room is on the third floor."

"Yeah. Since France has a ground floor, the third floor means the fourth floor, right?"

"That's right. You know well."

"Sigh... Maintaining old buildings isn't always a good thing. There's no elevator."

"At least the artworks are all moved, so that's a relief."

"True."

Kang Lim looked around. The Paris residency wasn’t as well-equipped as the Seoul one. It felt like an ordinary house.

Seo Yeon said,

“Probably... even though it's a communal shower room, you'll be the only one using it. Many people use this place just as a studio. Everyone will come tomorrow evening for your introduction.”

The residency provides lodging, but it’s not mandatory.

Usually, working for 12 days a month meets the requirement, so those who live nearby commute like going to work. It’s more comfortable to sleep at home.

“Then, I’m the only one living here?”

“No. Isabelle also stays here. But since she’s a woman, you probably won’t see her often. You’re on different floors.”

“How many people in total?”

“Counting you and uncle, six people. Haeyoung is very selective.”

“Ah, I see.”

“See you tomorrow. Get some rest. Are you very tired?”

“I’m okay. But where do you sleep?”

“I’m in the building right next door. It’s not a residency, just a house.”

Kang Lim recalled the building next door he saw when entering.

It had the same exterior but was heavily remodeled into a hotel.

“Jealous... I’ll come over to hang out.”

“What do you mean hang out? You can’t.”

“Oh, but shouldn’t you walk me there?”

“It’s right next door. There’s a guard, so it’s fine.”

“Got it. Good night.”

“Yeah. See you tomorrow.”

Kang Lim entered, changed his clothes, and unpacked his suitcase.

The studio and the room were separated by a single door.

“The studio is much larger than the room...”

He roughly organized the clothes he brought and lay down on the bed.

Through the window above his head, the night sky was visible.

The mattress was soft, and the stars scattered in the sky didn’t look bad.

* * *

The next morning.

Kang Lim came out to the yard. Most buildings in Paris are trapezoidal, having an empty space in the middle, and this place was no exception.

“Decorated like a Christmas tree. Cute.”

In the center of the yard stood a large tree.

Kang Lim stretched and sat on a chair in front of the tree.

Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath.

Recalling the scenes he saw yesterday, a map slowly formed in his mind.

Rustle. Rustle.

Then, hearing a sound from behind the tree, he opened his eyes.

He thought it might be a bug, but it was strange to think of bugs in this weather.

Then maybe a cat. Does the residency keep a cat?

Curious, Kang Lim got up and walked around the tree.

As he moved quietly, the small shadow avoided him and moved forward again.

"Then I should walk in the opposite direction."

In a swift turn.

He bumped into a child who appeared before his eyes.

The child rubbed his forehead with a small hand and looked at Kang Lim.

The moment their eyes met, Kang Lim’s heart sank.

She was an incredibly beautiful girl.

A girl with red eyes that shone like rubies.
