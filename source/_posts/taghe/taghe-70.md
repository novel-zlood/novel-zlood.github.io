## Episode 70: Personal Taste

The next day, Kang Lim arrived at school with an excited heart.

It was the first time he had received so much love from people, so he still felt thrilled and his heart raced as if he were still at the exhibition hall.

Moreover, with the confirmed news of participating in the Venice Biennale... it was a feeling that words couldn't express.

‘Ah, I shouldn't get too excited. I need to control my expression.’

Kang Lim composed himself in front of Gerald's lab.

He didn't want to laugh foolishly.

Knock, knock, knock.

As he carefully knocked on the door, a sound came from inside.

"Come in!"

Hearing the still energetic voice, Kang Lim smiled as he opened the door.

When he went inside, Gerald was also smiling brightly.

"Hello, Professor."

"Yes. Kang Lim, I saw your exhibition. It was really amazing, congratulations."

"Wow, did you come to the exhibition too?"

"Of course, I went before the opening ceremony."

"Thank you, even though you had already seen my works in class, it must have been bothersome."

"No, the presentation at the exhibition was out of this world compared to seeing them in class."

"Haha, that's true. I'm really grateful to the curator."

"Yes, it turned out well. You had an impressive debut. So, you must participate in this as well."

"What is it?"

Gerald took out the application documents for the National Art Competition from his drawer.

"I called you because I want you to participate in this."

Kang Lim received the paper from Gerald.

Looking closely, it was a poster for the National Art Competition.

It was a competition he already knew about.

It's the biggest competition that anyone involved in art in Korea would naturally know.

‘Although there are many rumors that the awards are predetermined for the relatives of the association members and the students of the judges...’

Kang Lim spoke with a puzzled expression, not understanding why Gerald recommended this competition.

"Professor, but I've heard that the top awards in this competition are already decided. Do I really have to participate?"

Gerald replied with an indignant expression.

"Of course! If you win the grand prize, you get a military exemption. Didn't you know that?"

"...What?"

"You must win it! I've heard this is the last year!"

Did I hear that wrong?

"This is great. More people will come to the next Heyum solo exhibition."

Ryu Junhee was checking out articles about Kang Lim in the residency room.

Usually, articles cool down quickly, but the unique story of Kang Lim was drawing attention for quite a while.

Ryu Junhee clicked on the article with the most comments.

[Kang Lim's First Solo Exhibition, The Twenty-Four Shades of Emotion]

On the afternoon of the 11th, Baekyeon Gallery in Gangnam. Artist Kang Lim (19) is conversing with the audience at the opening of his first solo exhibition.

The artist developed hyperthymesia after witnessing a murder during his childhood.

Through his ability to recall everything, he worked on this series by reflecting on the events following the incident 15 years ago.

He finally completed the paintings of his mother, which he had been drawing since childhood, this year.

Kang Lim's work is characterized by his delicate portrayal of figures and his sensuous and unique backgrounds.

Audiences were instantly drawn into his distinctive style that transcends both realism and abstraction.

Reportedly, Baekyeon Gallery received over 4,000 visitors in just one week, an unprecedented success for a gallery exhibition.

Industry experts praised his work, stating that his lyrical landscapes can be heartbreakingly poignant and convey intense, condensed fear, expressing all human emotions.

- Top Comments

- I went there and I highly recommend it, even for those who don't usually visit art galleries.

└ I went because it was free, and I was so moved that I even bought the catalog...

└ The gallery had such a weighty presence; it felt like emerging from a black hole, and I still miss it.

└ Only 4,000 people visited? Wow, I thought there'd be more.

└ Don't just read the article, go visit. The canvases are uniquely shaped, really special.

- Saw the artist at the opening, very neat and stylish. He seems very mature for a 20-year-old.

└ Agreed, he looks it in the photos.

└ Yes, he speaks very impressively.

└ His face and skin are youthful, but his voice is very manly.

└ I went just to stop comparisons with Junhee oppa, but I became a fan.

└ Why bring up Ryu Junhee, don't link him with a drug addict. He's a setting sun, while this kid is a rising star.

Ryu Junhee raised an eyebrow at the last comment.

Frustrated, he bit his lower lip and left a comment.

└ Maybe Junhee is working hard too?

As soon as he posted, a reply came instantly.

└ Welcome, Junhee.

└ What's up these days?

Ryu Junhee was startled and checked the login screen.

He was sure he had logged out.

“Ha, how did they know…?”

Being surprised by this, he felt like a coward.

Ryu Junhee chuckled in disbelief and stood up from his chair.

‘Since I'll be participating in the Venice Biennale with Kang Lim and joining the residency program in France... I should get to know him better.’

Since Kang Lim's residency room was right next door, Ryu Junhee decided to introduce himself.

* * *

Kang Lim was sitting forward in his chair, examining the paper with a serious expression.

It was the competition poster that Gerald had handed him.

‘In the past, winning a prize at the National Art Competition was a huge honor...’

In fact, most renowned art professors have won multiple special prizes or higher at the National Art Competition.

It was the only path to debut as an artist, similar to the New Year's Literary Contest in Korean literature.

Although it has diminished somewhat, the competition is still fierce.

How could he win the grand prize, beating out people from all over the country?

Especially when there are already corrupt practices? Just thinking about it gave him a headache.

‘I’m definitely not cut out for competitions. I prefer free work... Pianists also dislike competitions, maybe it's similar...?’

Seo Yeon suddenly approached Kang Lim, who was deep in thought.

Seeing her hair softly falling, Kang Lim relaxed his focused expression.

"What are you looking at so intently?"

"Oh, I was looking at this."

Seo Yeon checked the competition poster that Kang Lim handed her.

.

.

.

It was meticulously detailed, even down to the return period, probably because it was a big competition.

Small competitions usually don't return submitted works; they just discard them. They don't charge an entry fee either.

Seo Yeon skimmed through the poster and handed it back to Kang Lim.

A smile spread across her clear eyes.

"But you don't need to participate in this, right? Of course, it would give you an opportunity to exhibit and gain more recognition, but you're already famous. And the upcoming Heyum exhibition is more important."

"Yes, that's true... But look at this part..."

Kang Lim pointed to the special benefits for the grand prize winner at the end of the poster.

[Grand Prize winners receive a military service exemption in the arts sector]

Seo Yeon's eyes widened as soon as she read the text.

Covering her slightly open lips with her right hand, she spoke.

"Gasp, that's really important."

"Right? If I don't win the grand prize, it would be a huge loss for you."

"What? Why suddenly my loss?"

Kang Lim grabbed Seo Yeon's wrist and made a pitiful face.

"Sniff sniff, if I go to the military, we won't see each other often."

"...I can visit occasionally."

"That's nothing, so mean."

"Um, I'll write you letters sometimes too."

"That's still too mean... I should just tell you not to go..."

As the two were bickering, there were loud banging sounds from the door.

Ryu Junhee was already inside, looking like he'd seen something he shouldn't have.

Kang Lim was startled and stood up. It was the first time he'd seen him since their meeting with the senior.

"Oh, hello."

"Yes, hello? But aren't you two sticking too close! Your ID ink hasn't even dried!"

"......"

I thought he was a free spirit, but he seems strict with his nephew.

Kang Lim thought Ryu Junhee might be a bit old-fashioned.

Seo Yeon spoke with a slightly embarrassed expression.

"Uncle, you're always sticking with Aram unnie!"

Ryu Junhee stuttered in astonishment at Seo Yeon's response.

He was subconsciously glancing at Kang Lim.

"When did I! Hong Aram is just business. We're sticking together because of exhibition planning, no other reason. She's a curator, what can I do?"

"We're also business! We're here to plan Kang Lim's Heyum solo exhibition, mom told me to help!"

"Geez, you're talking back to your uncle now. You're all grown up?"

Seo Yeon glared at Ryu Junhee and stormed out.

Unaware that her words had pierced Kang Lim like a dagger.

‘Ugh, business...’

Feeling like a shrimp caught in a whale fight.

Seeing Kang Lim's narrowed eyes, Ryu Junhee chuckled.

Coming closer, he could guess what they had been talking about.

Ryu Junhee tapped the competition poster and spoke.

"Oh, are you planning to enter this?"

"Yes."

"Hah, I won the grand prize there."

"Wow, really? When? Any tips?"

Seeing Kang Lim's innocent expression and questions, Ryu Junhee tilted his head.

Usually, people would assume, ‘Of course, you won because you're with the Jeil Group,’ and wouldn't be curious.

This reaction was unexpected.

"Are you surprised that I won the grand prize?"

"Yes, of course. It's hard to win."

"But you're surprised that I won?"

"No? I don't mean it like that."

"Are you surprised that someone like me won?"

"No, I like your work, Ryu Junhee. I'm not saying it's surprising you won despite bad work, I'm just genuinely impressed."

"Haha, that's funny... I like you."

"What?"

"Call me hyung from now on! We're not that far apart in age."

"There's a 14-year age gap, though?"

Is this kid subtly mocking me... I'm already losing my youngest title...

Ryu Junhee looked up at Kang Lim.

His eyes were clear and honest. It didn't seem like a lie.

"Ah, that's not much! Just call me hyung."

"Okay, hyung."

Well, Hong Yoonki is also thirty but I call him hyung, so it's similar...

Kang Lim decided to be comfortable with Ryu Junhee.

"Hyung, can you pick a painting from my works that I should submit? They say once you win an award, you keep winning, so you must have a sense for it."

"I do know the association president's taste well..."

Ryu Junhee followed Kang Lim to the room where the paintings were stored.

* * *

‘Wow, they said 2,000 pieces, there really are a lot...’

It felt like visiting the wardrobe of a world-renowned fashion designer.

Ryu Junhee's steps slowed as he admired the paintings.

He was so amazed that he wanted to share what he saw with anyone.

But he clenched his teeth to avoid looking foolish with an excited expression.

‘Damn, why are there so many back views? Who is that?’

A man with a muddy flight jacket and crushed shoes.

The painting was uniquely created by applying paint and then scraping it off.

As he admired Kang Lim's work, Ryu Junhee carefully controlled his actions.

His senses were heightened, and his inner self kept vibrating.

Rapid heartbeat, dry mouth...

One thing was certain upon entering this room.

"Kang Lim, you can't."

"What?"

"Don't submit any of these paintings, create a new one. You can do it in a week."

"What? That big size?"

"Yes, they all look like part of a series, it would be a waste to break it up."

"That's true... But there are some that aren't part of the series."

"That would be even worse. Would you want to trade one of your unique pieces for a 20 million won prize? Your paintings would fetch more at an auction."

"No way, I'm not a seasoned artist, nor am I that famous yet."

"That will change soon. You've already got the Venice Biennale."

"Yes, but this is a really important competition."

"I know, that's why. You can't win the grand prize with these, they're too unique."

"What do you mean?"

"Look at this."

Ryu Junhee quickly captured and searched for some articles.

It was about the paintings bought by the president of the National Art Association.

"Competitions are different from regular work, more like entrance exams. To have a chance, you need to reflect the tastes of the top judge to some extent."

"Oh, that makes sense?"

"This is the taste of that old judge."
