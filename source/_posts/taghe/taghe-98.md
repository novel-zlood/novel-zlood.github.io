## Episode 98: Crossroads

The moment I stepped into Kang Lim's studio.

Warm sunlight and wind poured in through the wide-open window.

Inside the room, the backs of people were densely hung.

They were not hanging on the wall but floating in mid-air.

The paintings swayed gently in the breeze, appearing transparent as light passed through them.

Thus, the overlapping colors and delicate brushstrokes came across more dramatically.

What kind of moment does he desire? Why did he paint so many life-sized people?

Isabelle slowly walked into the world created by Kang Lim.

Paintings that boldly omitted backgrounds and only captured the dynamic gestures of the figures…

Each person's walking posture was different, and their clothes varied as well.

From homeless people in tattered clothes to office workers in neat suits, there was no single word to group these people together.

They were just ordinary people one might pass by on the street.

Isabelle felt like she was in the middle of a crowded square.

Naturally, old memories resurfaced.

When she lost Erlyn. Ignoring traffic signals, she ran like a madwoman, pushing through countless people.

Breathing heavily, with her breath catching in her throat, she feared she would never see Erlyn again, and tears welled up in her eyes.

'That's how I looked back then…'

Isabelle stopped in front of a woman.

A slender neck and delicately drawn hair behind the ears. The pale and fragile woman wore a chiffon dress.

Had she been running for a long time? Her sweat-soaked clothes clung to her skin.

The thin fabric revealed her drooping shoulder line.

Though her face was not visible, the tips of her eyelashes, dusted with dirt, were slightly visible.

Isabelle felt the melancholic heart of the discolored figure.

Surely, she would be staring at passersby with forlorn eyes.

With a weary expression that looked as if she might collapse at any moment.

'As expected, the immersion is incredible…'

Shin Hansoo observed the people admiring the artwork.

Not only Isabelle, but all the viewers were stopped in front of images that strongly drew them in.

Kang Lim's paintings made people project their emotions onto the subjects.

The atmosphere of light and shadow on the clothes was poetic and evoked a strong sense of presence.

'The dynamic gestures of the figures and anatomical structure are meticulously and delicately drawn, but the texture of the clothes is expressed lively and freely.'

The paintings naturally spurred imagination about the stories of these anonymous people.

A work that pierced through psychology and altered emotions.

'But why did he only paint the backs…'

Shin Hansoo, filled with curiosity, composed himself and approached Kang Lim.

Kang Lim watched the audience with a slightly bitter smile.

"You used a lot of different materials in this piece. Acrylic, oil, pastel, oil stick, and even traditional pigments."

Kang Lim responded to Shin Hansoo's words.

"The figures are diverse too. Gwanghwamun, Itaewon, Hongdae, Myeongdong, Gimpo Airport… I just captured people I saw while wandering around."

"Yes, the ethnic diversity was notable."

"This was a time when I experimented a lot with materials. I rubbed, tore, dripped, and smudged to express various textures."

"Yes, I saw paintings where you layered paint and scratched the surface to reveal the undercolor."

"Yes. A laborer's clothes covered in mud after a hard day's work seemed to suit the sgraffito technique well."

"Well, to be honest, your expressive skills are flawless. It's no longer surprising. But still, I find you refreshing every time. The reason is…"

At that moment, Shin Hansoo felt a sharp gaze behind him.

Stopping his words and looking around, he found himself surrounded by artists.

People blinking with blank stares. They had never seen Shin Hansoo praise someone before.

Ignoring them, Shin Hansoo continued.

"It's because of your spatial presentation. Your work is not just a painting. It offers a synesthetic experience to people. It's between installation art and painting. This is a contemporary work that transcends genres. I felt it at your second solo exhibition, but now it's even clearer. Why did you think of hanging the paintings in mid-air?"

Everyone was curious about this question.

"Well… actually, this is a very personal painting. It's an expression of my inner psychology."

Seeing Kang Lim pondering, Shin Hansoo laughed.

"Haha. You painted numerous anonymous people and expressed your inner self. That's very you."

"Yes, that's right. I think so too."

"Is it hard to talk about?"

"No, it's nothing special. I was just exploring the 'crossroads' that form between people and myself. That's the theme of this relay exhibition."

Kang Lim looked around at the paintings.

"Right now, the room is too small to hang even 100 pieces, but this work is actually one piece of 300."

Except for Ryu Junhee and Seoyeon, who had seen large-scale works before, the rest of the people murmured.

They couldn't believe there were more life-sized, highly completed figures like these.

How much work had I accumulated over the years?

Feeling both a sense of futility and excitement.

"When I see passersby, I sometimes feel like a lost child. It's a kind of interaction without much contact, but the impression it leaves on me is eternal, so it feels a bit lonely. Especially when I can't fully share memories with others, I feel a sense of detachment. That's why I like backs. It doesn't feel like I've received intimate personal information."

The expressions of the people watching Kang Lim gradually darkened.

It was because they were worried about his unique ability.

"Haha. It's not that hard! Sometimes, you know, when you're eating with family and you say, 'Remember when I did that? It was really funny, right?' and they reply, 'When was that? I don't remember.' It just feels a bit disappointing? It's not serious."

Looking at the artwork, Shin Hansoo spoke.

"Yes. That's why this emotion is felt. This space feels like individuals gathered, not a group. Isolated people standing alone without interaction. Moreover, since only the backs are shown, it gives a feeling of being ignored. Of course, this might be more comfortable for you."

"Haha, that's right. But even so, there's a point where everyone meets."

"The emotions felt by the viewers can connect."

"Yes. The back doesn't entirely lack information. Because the face isn't visible, you can closely read the nonverbal expressions from the person's gestures. Sometimes, just by looking at the fingertips, you can feel their heart."

"Indeed, your paintings are too meticulously drawn to have captured the subject in a fleeting moment. It reflects your perfectionist tendency."

Kang Lim shook his head with a helpless smile.

"Yes. In the end, I look closely at each person. When someone I met before suddenly appears on the news, I have all sorts of thoughts. 'Two years ago at the intersection, they seemed happy… What happened for them to make such a choice?' That's why I think I want to communicate with people."

Kang Lim stood up and walked among the paintings.

It felt similar to how silk was dried in the old palace's sedapbang.

With each slow step, the paintings made a sound as they moved.

How quiet must the studio be for this?

Kang Lim turned around abruptly with a playful expression.

"But doesn't it look too much like laundry hanging right now?"

It was a joke meant to lighten the mood, but no one laughed.

Instead, everyone had serious expressions. At times like this, it feels like they really care about me.

Kang Lim chuckled and said.

"I'm planning to add a few more people I saw in France and slightly change the installation method. On the day of the exhibition, I can perfectly reveal the chaos I felt."

People opened their mouths as if to say something, then closed them again.

They couldn't believe he wanted to add more to something already impressive.

Just moments ago, they thought they understood Kang Lim's inner thoughts, but it was all back to square one.

He was still a person shrouded in a mysterious veil.

* * *

A few days later.

Kang Lim went down to the kitchen for breakfast.

When he opened the refrigerator, he saw notes from people stuck on the door.

All were messages of encouragement for Kang Lim. Notes saying they made food as a gift and to enjoy it…

Since the day he unveiled his work, people had been overly kind to him.

'It's difficult if they see me as this pitiful. It's not that bad.'

Kang Lim placed bacon on the frying pan.

He had eaten so well recently that the thought of having a hearty meal early in the morning disappeared.

He decided to have a simple breakfast.

"Oh! Let me do it. Sit down."

"No, it's fine. I'm not a baby."

"But you said you felt like a lost child!"

"……."

Of course, it was nice that Seoyeon contacted and took care of him more often.

If he had known this would happen, he might have pretended to be sad sooner.

"Being still is important. My mom always says that too."

At that moment, Erlyn came in.

Despite being unable to see, Erlyn moved as if she could.

It was natural how she walked into the kitchen and climbed onto a high chair.

Having lived here since childhood, she seemed familiar with the layout.

"Unnie, can you read to me after you finish making the toast?"

"Yes. Okay."

At Seoyeon's answer, Erlyn's lips curled up slightly.

What was the reason for such a happy smile?

Was it because of Seoyeon? Or the book?

Kang Lim looked at the book Erlyn was reading.

A horizontally long book. The design looked familiar.

"Isn't this the book you made, oppa? It's really fun!"

Why is this here? I gave it to Shin Taemin.

Seeing Kang Lim's surprise, Seoyeon spoke.

"Taemin said he finished reading it, so I borrowed it. I read it to her for the first time yesterday, and she seems to like it."

"Oh, I see. Good job. It's originally for children anyway."

Well, he can buy another copy when it's published.

Kang Lim watched Erlyn turn the pages.

It was a pity she couldn't see the unique compositions and vibrant colors of the illustrations.

It would be nice if she could actually see and feel the characters…

As if reading Kang Lim's thoughts, Erlyn spoke.

"Erlyn can see everything. Unnie explained in detail how the pictures were drawn."

"Wow. That's really an amazing unnie. Erlyn must have a good imagination too."

At Kang Lim's compliment, Erlyn spread her arms wide.

It was cute how she opened her small hands and shouted.

"A huge turtle! The hard and big shell is cool!"

"Yes. The turtle in Erlyn's mind is probably cooler than the one I drew."

"The baby mouse Erlyn imagined is cuter too. It came up from the ground! Its soft fur is slightly dirty with soil, so it's a bit sticky. It needs to bathe in the sea."

"Oh? Really. It could be sticky."

"The dolphin is pretty too. It lives in a pond with fragrant flowers floating around. Its body is sleek, making a squeaky sound!"

Kang Lim was impressed by Erlyn's description.

For a five-year-old to imagine this after hearing the book once, her depiction was detailed.

'She's describing the tactile feel of the characters she imagined from the story.'

At that moment, a good idea popped into Kang Lim's head.

It seemed like the next project the publisher wanted would come out sooner.

"Erlyn! I'll make a fairy tale book just for you."

Could it be a New Year's gift?

Erlyn looked at Kang Lim with wide eyes.

Her raised eyebrows and open mouth. Her red eyes sparkled brightly.
