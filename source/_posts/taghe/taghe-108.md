## Episode 108: Live Painting

In front of Isenne Street, a gentle winter.

The restaurant chef had been looking at his phone all day.

[R.F Who is he?]

[The message R.F delivers, what is Parisian chauvinism?]

[A fresh artist in the art world, an icon of radical ideas.]

What the hell is this guy? Did he have a grudge against me?

The chef clicked on the article with the highest views, looking incredulous.

[The New Artist R.F Who Shook the Christie's Auction House]

At the Christie's first-quarter winter auction, a new artist's work was sold for 42,000 euros.

It is the highest price since the emerging artist Julie Mehretu.

Just as Julie Mehretu caught the eye of Theo Danjuma, the son of the Nigerian Minister of Defense and a collector, world-renowned collectors also visited the preview exhibition.

The most notable collector was, of course, William Carter, a representative of the super-rich.

Why is the art world paying attention to this new artist?

Carter said, "I have no intention of buying R.F's paintings. However, just as he showed a new interpretation of Da Vinci, I believe he will someday present a work that will overturn the contemporary art world. When that day comes, I will buy it."

There has been talk that R.F is gaining attention due to the recent Salvator Mundi incident that shocked the art world.

R.F's painting presented at this auction, <The Chef's Dish> is also gaining great popularity.

This work is a unique painting that stacks various course dishes.

It is characterized by the beautiful blending of colors and the texture of food on the canvas. When illuminated, letters hidden by the artist appear.

People, like R.F who enjoys deciphering codes, tried to interpret its meaning and discovered it was a special course dish at a racist restaurant.

Visitors said, "Somehow, the painted picture is beautiful but also disgusting."

There were also many opinions like "What kind of ingredients were used to give this feeling?"

.

.

.

- That place originally serves dishes one by one to colored people. :) Trash restaurant.

└ It's not surprising since I already knew. :<

└ Famous literati used to rave about it, thinking they were sophisticated, but the taste of the food is just terrible. It was better before the owner changed.

└ Only tourists like it. Parisians don't go there.

└ I hope the artist's social message cleans up Paris. This is a city of art.

- So who exactly is R.F? I'm really curious.

└ Probably a Brit like Banksy.

└ Could be a Frenchman? This Christie's auction was for Paris, after all.

└ Maybe a black person facing racial discrimination.

- William Carter is too greasy and loud.

└ He thinks he's a newcomer in the art world.

└ Flashy golden man. Typical Americans.

"No, even though they didn't name it, you can tell where it is. Can they publish an article like this? It's grounds for a lawsuit!"

The chef shouted as he scrolled through the comments.

He pounded his fist in frustration and stomped his feet.

The loud noise echoed through the empty restaurant, hurting only his ears.

He couldn't believe the place that was always packed with customers had ended up like this overnight.

The chef asked the waiter who was wiping down empty tables.

"Can't we sue this artist? Drawing our special dish like this means he did it on purpose."

"…Chef, don't you understand art? Even harsher political critiques don't faze the art world. And that course dish isn't patented as ours; other restaurants have been benchmarking it too."

"The taste is different! The taste!"

Well, it was saltier for people of color.

The waiter sighed and shook his head. It was ultimately their own fault.

* * *

The next day, Seoyeon and Kang Lim took the bus.

At the point where they passed the intersection and Isenne Street, the restaurant 'Gentle Winter' came into view outside the window.

Kang Lim whispered to Seoyeon as he saw the empty store.

"That place usually has a line at lunchtime, but now there's no one."

"Serves them right~."

Seoyeon chuckled, looking pleased.

"I never thought customers would disappear so quickly… I actually thought it might cause a noise marketing effect."

Kang Lim recalled numerous newspaper articles.

There were cases where the logos worn by criminals became trending search terms, increasing sales.

After all, exposure is crucial in advertising.

Seoyeon pondered and then spoke.

"Well… not everyone in Paris is a racist. There are many good people too. This is originally a country that values tolerance."

"Haha. Only in times like this?"

Kang Lim let out a small laugh.

He remembered the times when he ate with the professor. Even when it was clear he was being treated discriminatorily, no one seemed to care.

It wasn't that he was whining for help, but it somehow felt cold.

It made him realize he was a complete outsider, not wanting to interfere in others' affairs.

Of course, it could be the sense of alienation felt as a foreigner.

Seoyeon, as if reading Kang Lim's mind, said.

"Actually, the reason the customers stopped coming is simple. Parisians don't like getting involved in controversies… and they can be somewhat cold."

"Well, I get it. It's tiring to attract attention, and stepping up is bothersome."

"Right. It's the same now; eating at Gentle Winter gives the image of supporting racists, so they don't want to go."

"Yeah, people care more about appearances than you think. They don't like noise."

Seoyeon smiled slightly at Kang Lim's bitter tone.

"I still think these changes are important. Even if it's just a surface change, I think it's good."

"…Do you think it has any meaning?"

"Yes! Incidents like this will set a precedent and gradually bring change. It always starts small, doesn't it? I think you did really well."

Kang Lim followed Seoyeon's smile. It warmed his heart.

* * *

Kang Lim and Seoyeon climbed up Montmartre Hill.

Maybe because it was a holiday, many people were out in nice clothes enjoying the fresh air.

The lively sounds filled Place du Tertre.

With the white Sacré-Cœur Basilica in the background, street artists were performing.

There were people playing violins with cases open for coins, portrait artists drawing children's faces, and craft artists selling handmade accessories...

The free-spirited atmosphere automatically lifted their spirits.

Kang Lim looked around and said.

"Wow. I've only been to the flea market down there, but there are definitely more people here."

Seoyeon, watching a dancer joyfully moving to the music, said.

"There's always a lot of people because there's so much to see… There are even more in the summer."

"Then I should add one more thing to see."

"You're unstoppable..."

Kang Lim took out transparent plastic and a thick canvas cloth from his art kit.

He found a smooth wall without any texture, laid the clean plastic, and fixed the cloth.

As he took out the gouache paint, Seoyeon spoke.

"Aren't you cold? You have a good memory, but why do you always draw outside in winter?"

"Today is the last day. I've already drawn a lot."

"Wow… that was fast."

Kang Lim squeezed a lot of black gouache onto a large plate.

Seoyeon tilted her head, curious since Kang Lim usually mixed other colors to make black.

Sure enough, Kang Lim began coloring the thick cloth with a large flat brush.

"Gasp. Why are you painting the background black? And with pure black?"

"I'm changing the entire background color. After I finish this, I'll explain the concept of how to install it. It will be a really fun exhibition."

"……."

What is this guy up to now?

Seoyeon sat silently beside Kang Lim.

All she could do now was watch and record it on video.

After the shoot, art director Charlotte entered the props room.

Hats adorned with fancy feathers and tassels. A jacket with buttons in the front and a tailcoat at the back. A silk shirt with a ribbon tie...

The room was filled with carefully prepared costumes for aristocrats.

She passed by the costumes and went to the next room.

As she was about to open the door, she heard voices.

The loud voice of the painter who was scolded by Fraser last time could be heard.

"Oh, come on. I don't know how many times we had to reshoot that. Honestly, I've seen them just give an okay cut to actors like John Ford, right? It's total discrimination."

"Hyung, John Ford is a good actor."

"Yeah. Even I think he's pretty amazing."

"So you're saying I didn't do well? You guys wouldn't know, just making props! Try doing live painting! The directors here are too sensitive."

"…There's no one as kind as our art director."

"You!"

Charlotte stepped back and made a loud footstep.

After clearing her throat unnecessarily, she entered the room, and the people fell silent.

More than ten staff members responsible for painting...

Their aprons were stained with oil paint, and the room was filled with the headache-inducing smell of turpentine.

People blinked and stared at Charlotte silently.

Had she overheard their conversation? One of the staff, noticing her presence, spoke up.

"Haha. Hello, director."

"…It must be tough for you all, right?"

Charlotte opened a large window to let the cold air dilute the oily smell.

"No! There's a lot of pre-made stuff, so there's not much to paint. Really."

"Thank you. Especially you, Little, for painting live on set."

Little swallowed hard and opened his mouth.

She probably heard everything, so he might as well address it.

"Actually, painting isn't the hard part. It's embarrassing when the director yells at me in front of many staff."

"Fraser probably feels sorry for that too. It was something that slipped out on set."

"…Honestly, I didn't expect Director Fraser to use so much CG. He's known for making everything from scratch."

"That was for his sci-fi movies. Of course, he only did it for important scenes. The truth is, he uses a lot of CG, but people misunderstand. He emphasizes hand-crafted production in interviews."

Charlotte looked at Little.

That's totally image-making... He still looked dissatisfied.

"I know it was tough during the last shoot. Without a steam locomotive, it must have been hard to remember the original."

"……."

"Of course, there are places like the UK or Japan that still operate steam locomotives. But getting permission for all the staff and actors to enter takes a long time. Arranging lodging, flights, and location reservations costs a fortune. It's also hard to control the site once we arrive. But most importantly, the details would be lacking."

"Why is that?"

"We need to accurately recreate the 19th-century Saint-Lazare station in France. Since we can't get the same model of steam locomotive from back then, we made it with CG. Instead, we built a set and released smoke for realism."

Charlotte opened her notebook and drew several rectangular frames.

It was a simple summary of how the cuts Little repeatedly shot that day would be put together.

"As you all know, an important feature of Impressionist painters is that they completed their paintings outdoors. Although Barbizon School painters also painted landscapes during the same period, they finished them in the studio. Only the Impressionists held their brushes outdoors and completed their work on the spot."

Little watched as various weather and light-changing scenes were combined into one.

It wasn't like a montage cutting and pasting scenes.

It was a time-lapse showing the painting flowing.

"This scene shows Monet pushing his limits. That's why it must have been even harder. Thanks to your efforts, Little, we'll get a great painting."

"…I understand. Thank you for the detailed explanation."

"You're welcome. Now, I'll take a walk. Enjoy a good dinner."

Charlotte greeted the props team and stepped outside.

There were currently four people performing live painting. Little was the most skilled, but even he lacked the ability to capture form and color perfectly.

‘It might be covered up a bit in the video...’

Then again... It's unreasonable to perfectly reproduce the genius painters of the 19th century.

Their paintings are beloved for a reason.

Charlotte had been walking for 30 minutes.

She arrived at Montmartre Hill nearby.

This place, where Renoir's masterpiece <Bal du moulin de la Galette> was born, was still full of artists.

Despite the cold, they were out painting and playing musical instruments.

She stood in the middle of the open square and took a deep breath of the fresh air.

Watching her white breath, she noticed a crowd of people through the dispersing mist.

‘There are especially many people there. What's going on?’

Charlotte slowly walked over and mingled with the crowd.

There, an Asian with black hair was painting.
