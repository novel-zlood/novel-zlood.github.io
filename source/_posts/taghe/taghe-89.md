## Chapter 89: R.F

The secretary sighed as they looked at the dejected president of the association.

It wasn't like they had never failed to purchase a desired painting before... Why was he so depressed?

He had been in this state for days, leaving too many pending issues unattended.

"President, the exhibition for the invited artists is approaching. Should we proceed according to the plan submitted by the chairman of the operations committee?"

"...Even if we invite Kang Lim, he wouldn't come, would he?"

"Of course not. Except for the exhibition of the contest-winning works, he would likely decline any invitation. He's probably too busy now."

"Do you think <Seoljukdo> will be put up for auction after the exhibition?"

"Most likely."

"That would be hard to purchase too, right? It'll become even more expensive..."

"I don't think it will be auctioned domestically. The texture on the screen is unique, making it appealing even to foreigners."

The president gave a lonely smile.

His eyes lacked any sign of life.

"That's right. So <Ujukdo> was the last chance... my last chance to acquire it..."

"Cheer up. Thanks to Kang Lim, traditional Korean ink paintings were sold at that price. It has brought a change in the market trends, so more good Korean painters will emerge."

"I hope so..."

The best offer at the auction that day was made by the chairman of the Seongwoon Group.

A large company responsible for automotive steel plates globally.

There was no capital that could rival a steel company ranked among the top five in the world in terms of crude steel production.

The Korean Art Association, no matter how large, couldn't compare to a corporation.

This was a fact so obvious that after 140 rounds of bidding, they couldn't even lift their paddles.

They couldn't buy a painting by going into debt.

"Seongwoon Group will likely exhibit Seoljukdo at Seongwoon Art Museum alongside Ujukdo..."

"That's not certain. We don't know what kind of career Kang Lim will build in the future."

"Indeed, there are many wealthy people overseas too. They would probably have to pay a much higher price."

From here on, it was their world.

* * *

An artist whose works are sold for tens of millions at Korean auctions.

Kim Whanki, Lee Ufan, Park Soo-keun, Lee Jung-seop... Only people whose names everyone would recognize.

Kang Lim found it amazing that his name had joined that list.

‘Well, even though it's the same tens of millions, the number of zeros is different...’

In any case, he had established a corporation in his name and had become someone who needed to worry about taxes... It felt quite different.

Was the winter sky always this clear and clean? A smile naturally formed on his face.

Indeed, having rewards for one's efforts motivates even more.

‘I should continue practicing calligraphy to maintain my skills when I go to France. I need to bring Korean painting materials with me.’

Kang Lim organized his bank account and confirmed the remaining balance.

From the final winning bid of 220 million won, he was left with only the amount after deducting a 12% commission and a 3.3% tax.

Almost 30 million won had disappeared just like that.

‘Well, I understand the commission, but the buyer has to pay another commission on the winning bid, which must be frustrating. The higher the bid, the higher the commission they have to pay.’

Since the auction house is an intermediary, they charge commissions from both the consignor and the buyer.

It varies by company, but generally, consignors pay 10-12%, and buyers pay 14-16%.

This is why many people dislike the tertiary market, the auction.

‘The auction house has a lot to handle, such as artwork insurance, catalogs, preview exhibitions, promotions, and operating expenses once they accept a consignment.’

Despite this, some people say the commissions are too high.

These people buy artworks in the primary market (galleries) or the secondary market (art fairs).

‘It would be nice if I could pass my large-scale series to a good collector. Since I can't hold a preview exhibition, I can't put them up for auction.’

Artists don't always prefer auction sales.

Auctioned artworks are likely to end up in private ownership.

Especially wealthy art investors, who store the paintings until their value increases.

On the other hand, if a famous collector who owns a gallery buys the artwork, it gets a chance to be exhibited publicly.

They don't just hang the paintings in their homes and watch their value rise.

They hold exhibitions with the purchased artworks, aiming to make the artist a star.

Will this artist continue their work? Will they become a master and increase the artwork's value?

Or will they quit soon, causing the painting's value to plummet?

Famous collectors change the market trends themselves rather than worrying about these things.

‘While it's nice to give deep meaning to one person, it's better for the painting to be seen outside rather than being a private collection.’

Kang Lim hoped his works would meet as many people as possible.

He painted to communicate with many people.

* * *

‘Where is everyone?’

When Kang Lim arrived at Baekyeon Gallery, the exhibition hall was already empty.

All the black partitions had been removed, returning the gallery to its original white state.

Usually, artists help with the dismantling work, so he was a bit taken aback.

Dodo-dodo.

At that moment, he heard the busy footsteps of two people behind him.

They seemed to be trying to walk quietly, but it was futile.

There's no way the sound of shoes wouldn't echo on marble floors.

"Ta-da!"

"Congratulations!"

Kang Lim turned around, surprised to see Ha Baekyeon and the curator.

He had to respond at least a little to their effort in preparing the surprise.

When the curator set off a small cake firework, curly paper pieces stuck to his hair.

Ha Baekyeon handed the cake to Kang Lim and said,

"We've packed all the artworks and sent them to the residency!"

"Why didn't you let me help with the packing? It must have been hard."

"You're a precious artist; we can't let you hurt your hands!"

"...Thank you. And for the cake, I'll enjoy it."

"Oh, it's us who should be grateful!"

Ha Baekyeon had gained a lot from this exhibition.

Usually, public contest exhibitions don't earn rental fees from artists, so there's no income. They are held to support young artists.

However, this exhibition attracted the largest audience in Baekyeon Gallery's history, and the catalog sales were substantial, so they actually made money.

Moreover, the good exhibition record elevated the gallery's prestige, allowing them to secure a good spot at the art fair.

"Oh, I should be the one thanking you. I got my debut thanks to you picking me."

"No, Kang Lim, you gave other artists a great opportunity. Thanks to this exhibition, our gallery also secured a good position at next year's K Art Fair."

"Oh, really?"

"Yes, large art fairs gather thousands of galleries, and the closer to the entrance, the better. Our affiliated artists are also grateful to you."

"That's great. It's all because of your excellent planning. The gallery's reputation is deserved."

"Ha ha, thank you. But that's not all."

"What else?"

"You set a new record for the highest price in Korean painting! There aren't many artists doing traditional work, but thanks to you, more will emerge. The art market will become more diverse in genres."

Kang Lim flinched at the mention of Korean painting.

In fact, modern Korean painting still required more research.

While painting <Seoljukdo>, he felt that the fundamental spirit was contained in the materials.

By studying traditional materials in detail, he discovered the aesthetics of time, similar to life.

He also created a new texture.

A texture that could surprise foreigners who perceive Eastern painting as flat.

‘But, working like this is too slow...’

If the production process takes too long, it’s hard to survive in the contemporary art market.

It's difficult to fill large spaces.

‘Is there a way to shorten the time...?’

Modern Korean painting was still a task to be pursued.

Seeing Kang Lim looking slightly bitter, Ha Baekyeon tilted her head.

"You seem a bit gloomy on a happy day. Was the commission higher than you expected?"

Kang Lim burst out laughing at Ha Baekyeon's joke.

"Haha, no. It just seems like there's a lot to overcome ahead."

"That's the feeling all pioneers of new genres experience."

"Yes, I need to work hard."

The sight of an artist contemplating good work is always pleasing.

Ha Baekyeon smiled and rummaged through her file.

She took out a clean leaflet and a business card and handed them to Kang Lim.

"What is this?"

"It's a gallery we're affiliated with. I sent them the exhibition report for review."

"Oh, is this the good news you mentioned?"

"Yes! The <24 Solar Terms of Emotions> exhibition will be held in France again. The gallery there loved it. It will be installed with the same concept."

Kang Lim looked at the map drawn on the back of the gallery leaflet.

It was located just before the Montmartre hill in Paris.

A good place, close to Heyum.

"That's great. Actually, this exhibition is the best introduction of myself."

"Exactly. That's why I deliberately sent it near Heyum's Paris branch. After seeing that, they will understand your third solo exhibition better. Although I don't know what it will be."

"By some coincidence or fate, my third solo exhibition will also express my personal feelings."

"Oh, a personal story? That would be perfect for a joint exhibition. It will help people deeply understand you."

"Yes, up until now, I've been talking about the external world surrounding me. This time, I plan to talk about my own emotions. An inner story."

"So, is it a self-portrait?"

"Haha, no."

Kang Lim grinned as he tucked the business card into his coat.

No matter how much she asked, he wouldn't reveal it.

Keeping it confidential until the exhibition opens is the rule in this field.

Still, Ha Baekyeon felt a bit disappointed.

"Ugh... I'm really curious. I guess I'll have to go to Paris. Domestic fans would feel unfair."

"I hope many people feel that way, and many museums want to hold exhibitions of my works everywhere."

"That's likely. Your first solo exhibition was like that too."

"Haha, true. But when is the date?"

"It's about three weeks before your Heyum solo exhibition. I wanted to match it exactly, but their schedule didn't allow it. Still, it will be open for a month, so there will be a week of overlap, which should be enough."

"Hmm..."

Kang Lim bit his lip and lowered his gaze.

A slightly lowered chin, eyes deep in thought.

‘If the exhibition is in January, it coincides with my participation in the overseas auction under the name X...’

Kang Lim rubbed his forehead with his index finger and opened his mouth.

He seemed to need some advice.

"Director, this is a secret."

"Your third solo exhibition?"

"No, not that. I'm planning to submit a blind auction under the alias X. Using a genre that foreigners have never seen before."

"Is there such a genre?"

"Yes, so I want to hold the exhibition under the name X and maximize curiosity. When the third solo exhibition opens, it can gain explosive popularity. Of course, it's just a hypothesis."

A slow smile spread across Ha Baekyeon's face. It was an interesting idea just thinking about it.

A smart artist also knows how to promote themselves well. Kang Lim was modern in that aspect too.

"That's great! I'll have to revise the preface to send to the gallery. They might go crazy when they see a painting you drew at six years old. Since the artist is anonymous, you could attract all the attention not given to an Asian."

Pleased with the better-than-expected reaction, Kang Lim smiled.

"Really? Is it okay?"

"Of course! Secrets naturally make people curious. Batman is attractive because he operates with a mask. Masquerade balls were popular in Europe for a reason."

"True, art is the same. Banksy is still a popular artist because he hasn't revealed his face. People are curious about his identity."

Banksy is an artist who uses spray paint to draw on walls.

Since graffiti murals are considered public property damage by law, he started working while hiding his face.

His works convey social messages about human rights and critique commercial art.

Being an artist who criticizes traditional art, his faceless 'terrorist' image fueled his popularity.

"Banksy is still a hot topic. People guess he's comic artist Jamie Hewlett, or a member of the band Dry the Red, there are many theories. But you're not planning to keep your identity secret forever, right?"

"No, I'll reveal it when people start guessing and speculating."

"Haha, they'll probably think you're Parisian."

"Do you think so?"

"Definitely!"

Ha Baekyeon laughed alone, finding it highly amusing, then stopped abruptly.

She seemed to have a good idea.

"Oh! Then how about the alias R.F? If you're going to reveal it later, R.F would be better than X."

"What does it mean?"

"River Forest. It means the same as Kang Lim."

"Ah, that's fine. The name itself is a hint."

"Exactly. I'll revise the leaflets and catalogs to R.F. You're leaving this weekend, right?"

"Yes, I just have one thing to finish."

"Is there something else to do?"

"Hmm, I was supposed to meet someone nearby to help with the dismantling... Just a moment."

Kang Lim took out his phone from his pocket.

There were already many messages saying they had arrived.

"Oh, they must be here."

Kang Lim turned around and looked at the large glass window at the front of the exhibition hall.

There was no need to go outside.

Four people were already clinging to the entrance.

They looked like they hadn't washed or eaten for days...

They were clinging to each other like a patched rag.

Kang Lim glanced at Ha Baekyeon.

As expected, her face was stiff.

She asked with a pale expression,

"...Kang Lim, have the beggars already attached themselves to you?"
