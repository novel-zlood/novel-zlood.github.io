## Episode 125: A New Proposal

Kang Lim fiddled with the documents Franz had left behind.

The blueprint of the space where the artwork would be installed, the Barbara Gallery, caught his eye.

Although there were no restrictions on the genre or materials, the space itself imposed limitations.

In fact, this is true for all art exhibitions.

"Life and death, huh..."

Seeing Kang Lim frown slightly, Ryu Myeon laughed.

It meant that encountering a topic worth pondering as an artist would lead to significant progress.

She spoke in a reassuring voice.

"Death has been a common theme for many artists. The mere existence of life from birth to extinction is mysterious."

"...Ah, right. That's true."

"Franz's collection also includes many works on such themes. Works by Käthe Kollwitz and Edvard Munch, for instance."

"Yes. I saw the catalog of a previous exhibition, and they had paired Kollwitz's 'Mother with Dead Child' and Munch's 'Dead Mother' to maximize the emotional impact. One shows a mother who lost her child, and the other a child who lost their mother... It was fascinating because it showed opposite perspectives."

"I liked that too. Kollwitz's work is a black-and-white print, and Munch's is a striking oil painting, creating a synergistic effect. Franz likes such contrasts. That's probably why he sought you out, Kang Lim."

Käthe Kollwitz lost her son in World War I, and Munch lost his mother to illness during his childhood.

Both artists depicted the sense of loss and fear brought by death.

Kang Lim recalled the works Ryu Myeon had mentioned.

First, Kollwitz's print.

The work depicts a woman hugging and sniffing the corpse of her child like an animal.

The desperation to keep the warmth from escaping is indescribable.

At a glance, it could even look like someone devouring a heart.

"Such grief and sorrow are beyond my ability to express..."

Munch's work was no different.

A child standing in disbelief, clutching their hair, in front of a mother who had grown cold on the bed.

The child's large eyes, filled with shock, also confuse the viewer.

Combined with Munch's unique touch that distorts the indoor scenery, the moment of despair stands out.

"These artists spent their lives conversing with death. I can't do that."

As Kang Lim pondered, Ryu Myeon spoke again.

"Dealing with death doesn't always have to be heavy. I'm sure you'll do well, Kang Lim."

"...Why did Mr. Franz seek me out? Does he think I can express life and death together?"

"Wow. That sounds amazing. I can't imagine what it would be."

"I can't imagine it either..."

Kang Lim laughed awkwardly while looking at Ryu Myeon.

Well, there was plenty of time left, so he would figure it out somehow.

Carter wandered around Kang Lim's solo exhibition, "Black Hole."

Why were there so many guests in the meeting room...?

Usually, when he entered a museum, people who recognized him would bow and quickly guide him, but no one was here.

"Why is it so empty? It's full of guests."

"The staff at the counter said to wait a little. We'll go in soon!"

Adam glanced at Carter nervously.

If he were to list the top 100 most influential people in all contemporary art magazines, Carter would be the number one pick.

In such cases, Carter would usually be furious, feeling snubbed, but he stood firm and waited patiently.

"Do they not know who I am? No, that can't be..."

Carter looked down at his phone, a bit sullen.

His messages were filled with taunts from Frazer.

The content mocked his lack of insight and called him a blind man with open eyes.

"Damn it! Who would've thought the live painting artist and Kang Lim were the same person."

After a few minutes, a guest was seen leaving.

It must have been a curator visiting to hold the exhibition elsewhere.

Following the staff's guidance, Carter entered the meeting room.

The warm and cozy atmosphere was a welcome change from the large exhibition hall.

"Hello, Mr. Carter. Sorry to keep you waiting. If you had contacted us, we would have cleared our schedule."

At Ryu Myeon's friendly voice, Carter adjusted his clothes, feeling a bit self-conscious.

Of course, they knew who he was.

"Are you the director of Heyum?"

"Yes. This is artist Kang Lim."

"Hello, Mr. Carter. Nice to see you again."

Carter shook hands with Kang Lim. The grip was quite firm.

Seeing him again meant he had already seen him on the set.

"Nice to meet you. I didn't recognize you back then."

Carter politely declined Ryu Myeon's offer to bring out some refreshments.

He wasn't here to eat; there were more important matters to discuss.

'Why is this person here? My work isn't to his taste.'

Kang Lim sat and quietly observed Carter.

With his short, sporty haircut, thick beard, and sparkling golden eyes, he looked just the same as when Kang Lim first saw him.

It seemed he had a specific preference for the length of his hair and beard.

'He must have a strict style. I can see his stubbornness.'

Carter was also analyzing Kang Lim in his way.

There was something intriguing about the dark eyes, though he couldn't tell what lay at the end.

Of course, the proposal would make him his own.

"First of all, I want to buy this 'Black Hole' piece. Not as individual parts, but the chaos Kang Lim experienced as a whole. Will 30 million dollars be enough?"

Huh, suddenly? 300 billion won isn't just a dog's name. This guy sure throws big numbers around.

Indeed, the owner of Chelsea in Manhattan, New York. 'Carter Gallery' is the most famous among the 400 galleries gathered here.

Being the representative of West 24th Street, its annual sales exceed 3 trillion won.

'But would he call that price for nothing?'

Kang Lim narrowed his eyes, sensing there might be an ulterior motive.

Beside him, Ryu Myeon seemed a bit surprised.

No wonder. It's rare to find someone who wants to own such a large piece.

Moreover, just owning a piece by Carter would triple Kang Lim's worth.

Carter spoke as if reading their minds.

"Such large pieces are hard to own unless it's a national museum. But, unfortunately, national museums have no money. Only big players like me can afford private ownership. And considering Kang Lim's career and current market value, you won't get this offer anywhere else."

"But it's impossible to sell. 'Black Hole' will be displayed at the Defonce Museum in Frankfurt, Germany, and Brussels, Belgium, after the Heyum exhibition. It's already scheduled for six months. Also, I believe that artist Kang Lim should meet audiences in various countries."

"It doesn't matter. Just transfer the ownership. However, there's a condition."

"What is it?"

"Kang Lim is a residency-supported artist and hasn't signed an exclusive contract with Heyum yet, right?"

"Yes. He's free in that regard, don't worry."

Carter handed Kang Lim a prepared contract.

Seeing Carter's unblemished hands, Kang Lim nodded.

Of course. He expected this. Tying him down for five years.

"Read it carefully. It's a good deal. If you come to America with me, I'll make you a star. You'll feel like you own the world."

"Suddenly to America? But I'm still a student."

"Nonsense! In this field, geniuses dropping out is the norm!"

"...I'll break that stereotype."

"Still don't get it?"

What do you mean, get it? You old man...

Kang Lim sighed and picked up the contract on the table.

Carter began to boast about himself with precise enunciation.

"The Korean art market is worth 500 billion won. Europe is bigger than that, but it's nothing compared to America. Here, it's 30 trillion won. You can't imagine my share in that. I can penetrate the heart of the New York Museum of Modern Art in one go. One word from me, and your work will be displayed immediately."

Kang Lim stopped reading and put the contract down.

It wasn't because of Carter's boastful attitude.

There was one condition he didn't like. As long as this condition existed, he didn't want to go to America with Carter.

"Why should I not do painting for a year? I don't like conditions that limit my work. I refuse."

Ryu Myeon smiled at Kang Lim's firm stance.

In fact, many artists take orders to paint.

If someone became famous for creating works with torn socks, they might receive requests specifying the type of socks they preferred.

So Carter's proposal wasn't very unreasonable in the industry.

"Some call this the dark shadow of exclusive contracts... But Kang Lim doesn't need to conform."

Kang Lim felt the same. 300 billion won. It's an enormous amount, no doubt. It could support him for life.

But he didn't decide to become an artist to make money.

He wanted to console people and create works that society needed to communicate.

Moreover, the freedom to create his own works was Kang Lim's happiness.

"I can earn money through children's books, movies, and rising stocks... What use is this to me?"

Kang Lim coolly turned his head away from the conditions that didn't benefit him.

There was only one person, no, two people, shocked by this situation.

Adam watched Carter, biting his nails.

His expression was more surprised than Munch's "The Scream."

He stood still for a while, then spoke.

Adam heard him whispering softly.

"Did I just get rejected? I love it!"

"..."

Adam was startled by the unexpected reaction.

When would he ever understand Carter?

Carter's golden eyes sparkled with excitement.

The weather was still too cold for flowers to bloom. But the buds were nurturing new sprouts, waiting for the warmth.

Shin Taemin walked into the dormitory with a blank expression. It had been quite a while since he arrived at Beaux-Arts.

Screech—

Opening the door made a rusty metal sound.

The first thing he saw was snack bags scattered on the floor.

"Ha. No matter where I go in the world, art facilities are never good."

He walked into the living room without taking off his shoes. The dust footprints on the floor were still unfamiliar.

The roommate who left socks everywhere and the smell of feet was no different.

"That guy is really dirty."

Shin Taemin pinched his nose with one hand and pushed the socks aside.

Even from a distance, the stench seemed to waft up.

His roommate, Baudouin, who noticed him belatedly, shouted.

"Wow, damn! When did you get here, Taemin?"

"Just now."

"Make some noise when you walk! It scared me like a cat."

Ignoring the greasy French, Shin Taemin stocked the refrigerator with bottled water he had bought from the market.

Even with his back turned, he could see Baudouin climbing onto the bed with his shoes on.

Not all foreigners are like that. This guy was especially messy.

Baudouin called out to Shin Taemin while stomping on the white bed sheets, which had turned yellow.

"Oh, right! Taemin, did you see this?"

"What is it?"

"The March issue of ArtPrestige is out! It seems to have been released today."

ArtPrestige, known as the European Time magazine. The cover Baudouin handed over had Kang Lim's face on it.

It's surprising. In the short time apart, he didn't know when this guy had grown so much.

Shin Taemin flipped through the magazine to find the article related to Kang Lim.

There was a review. Written by his father.

"Isn't that totally rigged? Easterners sticking together to boost each other up."

As he read the review, Baudouin's sarcastic voice came.

Shin Taemin frowned slightly and spoke.

"What do you mean?"

"Ah, sorry. You're an Easterner too, Taemin. I didn't mean to be racist. I was criticizing the top-tier art world's practices."

"...Brother, Shin Hansoo isn't like that. He doesn't analyze artists he doesn't like in such detail. And other critics are also talking about Kang Lim's work."

"Still, being on the cover of ArtPrestige consecutively is too much!"

Shin Taemin sighed and approached Baudouin.

Up close, the sight of him lying on the bed was even more ridiculous.

He felt like kicking that messy butt.

Maybe if he rolled over, the dust stuck to his long curly hair would fall off. Or maybe more would stick.

"Brother, do you know what happened to the person who was jealous of Kang Lim at the university I attended?"

Baudouin sat up, startled.

He widened his small eyes and asked.

"What, you went to the same school as Kang Lim?"

"Yes, we're friends."

"...Ahem. You should have said so!"

"Anyway, there was a girl who poured paint on his painting. But later, it splashed on her painting too."

Baudouin pouted his lips.

As if asking why he was telling him this out of the blue.

"So what?"

"I'm telling you to be careful of jealousy."

"I'm not someone who would splash paint on other people's work!"

"Then that's a relief."

"Did you really see me that way? Taemin! I'm disappointed."

Ignoring Baudouin's loud complaints, Shin Taemin said.

"Anyway, you'll find out in class. Kang Lim is definitely different."
