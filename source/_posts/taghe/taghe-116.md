## Episode 116: Strange Connection

Early in the morning, after finishing the shoot, Kang Lim entered the props room to organize the paintings.

Even though he wasn't the artist painting the same scene on set, he wanted to help since they were a team.

He wanted to finish the work quickly to have lunch.

'Even though they are copies, it's nice to see the paintings used as props.'

He enjoyed looking at the works of Caravaggio and Rembrandt, masters of the Baroque era.

There were so many works by Botticelli, who was supported by the Medici family during the Renaissance… His paintings were filled with codes praising the family that raised him, as Botticelli had filled his works with symbols of the Medici family, like orange trees and laurel.

These props showed that nobles have been nurturing artists since ancient times.

'The protagonist deciphers all the codes in the hundreds of paintings in the storage. Among the foolish nobles, he shows a remarkable ability that catches the count's interest. The staff must have worked themselves to death to create that one scene...'

Kang Lim admired as he wrapped an antique frame. He could feel their hard work on his skin.

"Really stylish. These are the masterpieces that will go into the storage set, right? You must have worked hard. It's like a whole truckload."

A staff member with messy hair and glasses scratched his head and said.

"No, many were pre-made. We only painted a few pieces."

"Still."

Indeed, for the movie "Loving Vincent," they hired 107 painters to paint oil paintings for 10 years. It meant that not all the staff in the props room were involved in this movie. Kang Lim carefully moved the paintings, thinking about this.

The staff member spoke with a worried expression.

"But you don't have to help with this. If you get hurt, it will be hard to do makeup."

Kang Lim waved his hand and said.

"Hey, what can hurt me while moving this? It's fine, I'm also part of the staff."

From a distance, Little grumbled as he watched the scene.

He found Kang Lim annoying for moving immediately to the car after shooting. No painter was treated as well as him, with a car provided by Charlotte.

Maybe it was jealousy. Helping now seemed like an act to appear nice.

"Kang Lim seems to have a good personality. And he paints really well!"

"Right. I also want to have those skills, become an art manager, and live well."

The staff were cheerful, unaware of Little's feelings.

'They love him...'

At that moment, Little's eyes caught someone. A curly-haired man crouched in the corner, holding his head.

Little, feeling mean, yelled at him.

"Mary! Haven't you finished yet? How long are you going to be stuck on it?"

"Ah… It's difficult because it's not a direct copy of a masterpiece."

"It's Sisley's village landscape! It's not a live painting, just a prop for a short exhibition, and you still can't paint it?"

"Cézanne is supposed to hit his peak because of the protagonist, and Sisley is shocked, changing his painting style… I can't figure out how to paint it."

Cézanne was a master who painted fragmented screens from multiple perspectives. He simplified objects to create abstract forms, fundamentally giving birth to Cubism. It's often said that without Cézanne, Picasso wouldn't exist.

"Ah, Mary! How about having lunch and then visiting an exhibition with me?"

Kang Lim smiled brightly at Mary.

A good idea had come to him.

* * *

Kang Lim had lunch with the staff and moved to the exhibition hall.

One of the benefits of Paris being small was that everything worth seeing was close by, so they could enjoy it together. This included the Heyum Paris Hall.

Heyum was currently holding Isabelle's solo exhibition.

As they opened the door and entered, a pure white world unfolded. It was dazzlingly clear and clean.

If they had seen Isabelle right away, they might have mistaken her for the Snow Queen.

'They say she's a rising star in France… It's true.'

Kang Lim looked around.

Even though it wasn't the opening, there were quite a few people, indicating Isabelle's popularity.

There were occasional magazine photographers as well.

As expected, the staff began to chat in the exhibition hall.

"Wow! I know her. She's famous. The rising star of French painters!"

"Wasn't she an albino?"

"Right! It's Isabelle. This will definitely help Mary. Sisley painted snowy landscapes all the time!"

"Oh. So that's why you recommended this, Kang Lim?"

Alfred Sisley was a painter known for many snowy landscapes.

He wasn't very famous but was called one of the best landscape painters, showing calm and simple touches.

Even Camille Pissarro, who was like a teacher to the Impressionists, said so.

Kang Lim smiled at the staff.

"Haha. It's not a snowy landscape, but I think there's something similar to Sisley. It will help."

"Thanks for thinking of us!"

Mary pushed through the people and went deep into the exhibition hall. She wanted to quickly get ideas for painting props.

"Wow… It's much more impressive than I thought. I've only heard of Isabelle, this is my first time seeing her paintings."

Kang Lim also followed Mary inside. It was his first time seeing Isabelle's works as well.

The exhibition hall had several large masterpieces hanging. They all depicted white cities. The words written in the preface calmly touched the heart.

[I have never painted snow. But people think I paint snowy landscapes. That's the difference in our perspectives.]

In front of the white houses Isabelle painted, white grass was spread. A white deer was grazing in the middle.

On the right, warm natural light came in. Clear yellow and light green mixed softly, creating a dazzling aurora.

Next to it was a white tiger drinking transparent valley water. It supported the ground with its heavy front paws and stretched.

The surreal landscape. The mysterious nature breathed. The unique part was that there was a crack drawn on the front of the painting.

It was as if a thick glass window was placed between the canvas and the audience. The utopia depicted in the painting was thoroughly cut off from the viewer.

Mary looked at the surface of the painting and said.

"The theme of Isabelle's solo exhibition is 'Intersection.' What's drawn on the surface is not a glass barrier but ice."

Kang Lim listened to Mary's words and continued reading the preface.

[The artist captured the points where relationships freeze and melt.]

As the words suggested, Isabelle had drawn a thin ice barrier on the front of her works.

It subtly revealed that the peaceful world could break at any time.

The utopia she lived in could melt or disappear due to someone's appreciation.

[The temperature of the world you and I live in is different. Then, what is the most appropriate temperature for us to meet?]

Mary read Isabelle's artist's note while appreciating the landscape.

The thin barrier drawn on the front of the screen felt like the circulation of light and air. The movement was faintly shaking, just like her appearance, making a part of her chest ache.

"Kang Lim… The fragmented part of the screen looks like Cézanne's paintings. The viewpoints of the village are drawn differently in each broken ice panel, making it look like a mosaic."

"Right. That's why I wanted to show it to you. Also, don't you feel Sisley's emotions?"

Mary quietly nodded.

"Yes. Sisley's brush touches are really delicate and lyrical compared to other Impressionist painters. He painted many snowy landscapes… I always felt a sense of warmth and sadness."

Kang Lim spoke with a serious expression.

"Exactly. Snow looks nice but ultimately means isolation from the outside. Although Sisley was British, he lived in France, and he might have unconsciously felt isolated. When other Impressionist painters painted their hometowns, he painted a foreign land."

"Wow… I never thought of it that way. I can immediately picture the introverted character of Sisley."

"Yes. It has that unique melancholic feeling of Britain. The gloomy weather, perhaps."

Mary thought of Sisley's "Snow at Louveciennes."

A black figure passing through the snowy field. Who was the veiled shadow? It might have been Sisley himself.

Mary quickly opened her notebook and started sketching.

The way to mix the fragmented perspective with the snowy landscape. She could get the hint for the painting from Isabelle.

She connected the scattered memories of Sisley one by one.

Just as Picasso was inspired by Cézanne, a new landscape painting was being created.

'Now that it includes the artist's perspective digging into the other side of the subject… it will have a unique sentiment.'

Kang Lim slowly moved away from Mary to let her concentrate.

* * *

Passing through the exhibition hall, he entered the meeting room.

Isabelle was enjoying tea with Erlein.

It was customary to attend the opening, but he was sorry he couldn't make it due to filming.

Kang Lim handed over a bouquet with an awkward expression.

"Sorry I couldn't come to the opening."

"Oh, no! I know you were busy with filming. And why did you bring this?"

Despite Kang Lim's awkward expression, Isabelle seemed pleased.

She looked happy, inhaling the floral scent with a big smile.

It was hard to believe she had been so sharp during their first meeting.

"Oppa, you're here? Erlein is reading a book."

Erlein waved at Kang Lim from where he was sitting.

His chubby cheeks twitched. He was holding a handful of cookies in his mouth and looking at a picture book. No, to be exact, he was touching it.

'It might turn black before it becomes a dolly.'

As if reading Kang Lim's mind, Isabelle burst into laughter.

"Haha. He clings to that book. It must be interesting."

"Thank you for reading it to him."

"I didn't know you were good at writing children's books too, Kang Lim."

"Well, I started writing again thanks to Erlein. I didn't expect to work on it again after the first publication. I'll bring the audiobook when it's out. It's hard to read, right?"

"No, it's Seoyeon who has a hard time."

Isabelle whispered to Erlein.

"It's a book that friends like you can read too. When you go to school, you can talk about Dolly with everyone, right?"

Erlein was about to enter a school for the blind.

In spring, he would attend classes with friends like little chicks. That would be cute too.

"Really? This book is increasing? Everyone can touch Dolly?"

Kang Lim laughed and said.

"Yes, thanks to you, Erlein. This book will be sent to the Bologna Book Fair. Many people will be able to see it."

"Wow! That's exciting."

Erlein clapped his small hands but stopped.

After a moment of hesitation, he carefully brushed off the cookie crumbs around his mouth.

"So Dolly doesn't get dirty, I'll only touch it a little."

Kang Lim and Isabelle laughed as they watched Erlein.

Erlein's sparkling hair swayed, and his red eyes curved nicely.

A few days later, during an evening shoot.

Rachel, who was filming the making-of, diligently followed Kang Lim.

It was a close-up coverage. She seemed determined to capture every detail, even the fine hairs.

Kang Lim felt burdened by her intense gaze and turned his head.

'…I should just draw.'

Kang Lim grabbed a large drawing book and sketched the structure of the castle where the count lived.

In front of the entrance, carriages were lined up. Extras playing coachmen had neatly arranged them. It was like a parking lot filled with expensive foreign cars in modern terms.

As he entered the banquet hall, a grand chandelier and luxurious red carpet came into view.

The orchestra members were preparing for a rehearsal.

The well-coordinated members tuned their instruments a few times, nodded at each other, and started playing as soon as the conductor's hand moved.

The lively melody of the first violin began, and Johann Strauss II's song filled the air.

The empty ballroom quickly transformed into a field full of spring flowers. The music alone filled it with people.

Kang Lim sketched the space and planned the composition.

He wanted to get familiar with the structure before people filled it, as it would become harder to see then.

"Oh! Kang Lim, you sketch too."

Rachel, along with the cameraman, looked at his notebook.

Kang Lim answered in a matter-of-fact tone.

"Of course. Even if it's live painting, you need to plan the composition. The framing might change on site, though."

"Oh... Then does that notebook have all the paintings you've done on site?"

"Yes."

"Can I take a look? I'd love to capture everything on camera."

"Sure."

Kang Lim put down his pen and lent the sketchbook. Rachel slowly turned the pages.

Her eyes widened with each page she turned.

"Um... Kang Lim? It's not just live painting sketches..."

At that moment, the voice of the filming director was heard.

"Kang Lim! Come here. I'll explain the movement."

"Yes!"

Kang Lim signaled Rachel to take care of the notebook and disappeared. Rachel could only watch his departing figure in dismay.

"Today's scene will be shot with a long take of the actor's movements, so the sequence is a bit complicated. It's a very important sequence. When Christian goes up these stairs..."

Assistant director Martin watched Kang Lim from beside the filming director. He liked the serious look in Kang Lim's eyes as he listened to the director's explanation.

'When painting Gauguin's work, the actor didn't paint delicately, but he accurately matched the major actions.'

Kang Lim had turned the strange abstract painting drawn by the actor into a beautiful composition, implementing several actions in sequence.

He was an actor who pinpointed the director's editing points.

'This is the first time I've seen such a detailed double performance.'

Martin observed him with a pleased expression, when Rachel approached with a pale face.

She handed Martin the sketchbook, insisting he needed to see it.

"What's this?"

"It's what Kang Lim has drawn so far. Just take a look. You'll be amazed."

After understanding the filming director's explanation, Kang Lim looked at Martin. He was examining his sketches.

Martin's eyes seemed ready to pop out. His face was full of astonishment.

Naturally, Kang Lim's eyes also trembled strongly. Behind Martin, he saw a familiar face.

"...What's that person doing here?"

Kang Lim asked, seeing the golden figure walking from a distance. It was William Carter, unexpectedly appearing on set.

"Oh, he was supposed to come today."

The filming director said nonchalantly.

"Didn't you know? Carter and Director Fraser are alumni. They've been close for a long time. He sometimes visits the set to watch the filming."

"From the U.S. all the way here?"

It was surprising that they were close. Both didn't have the best personalities, so he thought they would clash, but it was unexpected.

As Kang Lim blinked, the filming director grinned.

"Haha. Well, he doesn't usually come this far. It's because Carter is staying in Paris these days."

"Why?"

"You know that painter who's a big deal right now? Carter is here to see R.F's solo exhibition. It's at Seine Gallery near Montmartre tomorrow. Didn't you see the news? Carter publicly showed interest."

"So he's been waiting around since the auction?"

"Probably."

The filming director burst into laughter. Knowing Carter's obsession with getting what he wanted, he understood his actions.

"Haha, come to think of it, isn't this a good opportunity? I heard you're also a painter, Kang Lim. Where are you affiliated?"

"...Heyum. It's an art gallery in the Luxembourg."

"Oh, that's a great place!"

The filming director patted Kang Lim on the shoulder.

"Take this opportunity to do well! I've heard that the value of a painting skyrockets based on who owns it. Carter might fall for you too, Kang Lim."

"...I'm not really Carter's type."

"Oh, come on. I think you're a better painter than R.F. Carter will probably think so too if he sees your live painting. Don't feel down! Let's beat R.F!"

Kang Lim shook his head.

Art was truly a battle with oneself.
