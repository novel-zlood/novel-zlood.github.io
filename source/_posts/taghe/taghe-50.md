## Episode 50: Dedicated Curator

Famous artists often have dedicated curators.

This is because the sheer volume of works produced by a single artist is staggering, leading to the need for experts who study their entire life.

In Korea alone, there are dedicated curators at places like the Nam June Paik Art Center and the Whanki Museum who research the lives of artists and plan exhibitions.

Artists are often so immersed in observing the world and drawing out their thoughts that they lack the time to do anything else.

Thus, curators are responsible for the preservation and management of artworks, creating an archive that can explain the works to others by dividing them chronologically.

While studying the artist's life, they organize the values left behind by the artist.

For famous artists, it is not uncommon to have simultaneous exhibitions in multiple countries like the U.S., Germany, and China.

However, since artists primarily attend press conferences for exhibitions where they reveal new works, dedicated curators handle overlapping schedules and manage these exhibitions.

There is a constant need for someone to set exhibition themes, manage the transportation of artworks in and out, and oversee their preservation.

Seoyeon instinctively felt that Kang Lim would become such an artist.

No other person or work of art had ever made her heart race like this.

Nodding, Seoyeon exchanged a meaningful look with Kang Lim, who had stirred indescribable emotions in her.

"What? You want to have it?"

Of course, Kang Lim interpreted that feeling entirely differently.

"I'm all for it."

Kang Lim grabbed Seoyeon's hand, closing the distance between them.

Seoyeon was flustered.

She was already confused about why her heart was racing.

Was it because she had climbed up the hill out of breath?

Was it the shock from seeing so many paintings?

Her mind was in a whirl, leaving her overall dazed.

A mix of surprise, joy, emotion, and excitement swirled within her.

Kang Lim held her hand for longer than necessary.

Feeling embarrassed, Seoyeon tried to pull her hand away, but Kang Lim, determined not to miss the opportunity, held on tightly and didn't let go.

Finally, with a flushed face, Seoyeon shouted.

"That's not what I meant! You idiot!"

"Ugh."

Kang Lim, caught off guard, got kicked in the shin and fell to the floor.

Seoyeon was as unpredictable as ever.

"Can I take a look at the paintings? Give me some time."

Seeing Seoyeon deep in thought, Kang Lim nodded quietly.

It was the first time Kang Lim had shown such a personal space to someone, so he felt a strange sensation.

He stepped back a bit and leaned against the wall.

He thought both he and Seoyeon needed time to adjust.

"Wow..."

Seoyeon slowly examined each painting as if they were speaking to her.

She seemed like someone who had stopped all time to be present in this moment.

Shaking her head in disbelief repeatedly.

Her eyelids quivered.

It was only after a long while...

Seoyeon emerged from the world Kang Lim had created.

"Can you tell me about your life? When did you start drawing these kinds of paintings...?"

Hmm, where should he start?

Kang Lim found Seoyeon's overwhelming empathy fascinating.

No one had ever asked him about his life before, so it touched him in a way.

Kang Lim slowly began to speak.

He talked about the strange abilities and explosive talents he had from a young age.

How he worked obsessively towards the vague goal of becoming an artist.

Though he didn't go mad, the excessive information he handled made him feel a bit drained.

As he started sharing past events with Seoyeon one by one, he began to feel at ease.

Kang Lim was realizing how precious it was to open up about his past to someone.

* * *

Kang Lim found Seoyeon's constant testing of his abilities endearing.

"Can you remember this all at once?"

"You seem to really enjoy this."

"Of course! It's so fascinating!"

Seoyeon said as she flipped through an art history book from her bag.

"What's on the 3rd line of page 184!"

"Hey, that's something you'd need excellent peripheral vision for. I didn't even look at it."

"Ha, that's funny."

Seoyeon spent the whole day listening to Kang Lim's explanations.

About the background behind each painting.

She also took photos of the series and key works to feature in his solo exhibition portfolio.

Fixing the paintings to the clean rooftop wall, she took pictures under natural light.

What touched Seoyeon the most today, after seeing various paintings, was that Kang Lim had grown up under genuinely good parents.

Parents anyone would envy...

"So they were worried about you and didn't even let you appear on those common TV genius programs. Despite their worries, they gave you the space to do what you wanted... They're really incredible."

Knowing that their only son might be autistic.

The fact that he might suffer his whole life from handling too much information.

How difficult must it have been for them to accept that as parents?

And how happy must they have been when he grew up healthy?

Kang Lim's series captured all those emotions.

Seoyeon softly stroked Kang Lim's hair.

"You've grown up really well too."

Kang Lim laughed as he looked at Seoyeon.

It was funny to hear such words from someone so small.

Still, Seoyeon's gentle and kind words made his heart feel warm.

Smiling at her warm touch, Kang Lim said.

"But if I had received attention when I was young, wouldn't I already be really famous? I sometimes think that."

Seoyeon shook her head and said.

"No... Originally, artists shouldn't debut until they have enough works to hold four solo exhibitions in a row before their first solo show."

"Why? Who said that?"

"A famous art director. But I agree with that. Those who haven't fought alone don't have a worldview. Works without personal uniqueness are just technical images."

"Hmm..."

"Many people who released their works before establishing a solid foundation ended up losing themselves due to too much attention. But a person who stands on solid ground can withstand anything."

"So, you're saying I have a worldview?"

"Of course. I knew it the moment I saw it."

Kang Lim blinked in surprise.

He had always thought he was working on various things with no distinct characteristics.

His materials and styles were so varied without consistency.

"What is it? What's my signature?"

"It's the Hegelian dialectic of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. It's like the order in which history is built."

Kang Lim laughed, thinking Seoyeon was overhyping him.

It was too philosophical.

"Haha. What's that? You're giving it a huge significance. As expected of a curator..."

But Seoyeon spoke seriously.

"It's true. You have the ability to combine conflicting elements into something new. You can tell from your unique sense of moving between abstraction and realism. Plus, you also do traditional Korean painting. You're using both Eastern and Western materials. This means you have endless potential for growth.

Looking back, I understand why you kept saying you wanted to do popular contemporary art. Those two strongly clash. That's why you were drawn to it."

"Wow, really? When you put it that way, I do have a signature."

"Yes, you're a passionate mediator. Even when opposing elements clash, you seek peace. You create something entirely new at that point."

Kang Lim liked how Seoyeon interpreted his works.

He also liked her flushed face and sparkling eyes.

"Oh, that's good. Then I just need to keep working. I don't need to artificially create my signature."

"Yes, of course. You're doing well. You've worked so hard. From now on, I'll help you."

"What are you talking about? You're already helping a lot."

"All these thousands of paintings here need to be professionally photographed in a studio."

"What...?"

Seoyeon glanced around Kang Lim's room.

Although it wasn't an old villa, and was still in good condition, leaving the paintings as they were would definitely harm those done on mulberry paper.

Traditional Korean paintings are too sensitive to temperature and humidity.

They fade quickly and get damaged by drafts, requiring more professional management.

"I'll explain everything later. Your paintings must be kept in the best condition."

Seoyeon looked at her wristwatch.

It was almost time for dinner.

"Your parents will be back soon. We should go."

"Ah... No. My father has to work late today."

"What about your mother?"

Speak of the devil.

At that moment, the door opened and Lim Yujin walked in.

She had been writing at a cafe and then did some evening grocery shopping before arriving.

Lim Yujin had been listening to their conversation outside the door.

"Hello. You must be Kang Lim's friend. Why don't you stay for dinner?"

Seoyeon, surprised, greeted her, and Lim Yujin whispered as she came closer.

"You're so pretty... If Kang Lim bothers you, just tell me. I'll handle him."

"Mom! I can hear you."

"Oh... I thought I was speaking softly."

Seoyeon burst out laughing at Kang Lim's grumbling.

* * *

The cleanly tiled marble floor.

A terrace divided by rugs.

Ryu Miyeon sat on a modern chair reminiscent of Bauhaus and opened the file Kang Lim brought.

First, she checked his enrollment certificate and was surprised by an unexpected fact.

"I heard he was a student at Korea National University of Arts, but I didn't know he was a freshman. Then he's in the same year as Seoyeon..."

Next, she took out the portfolio Kang Lim had submitted.

Inside were photos of two installation works and one painting.

A static yet explosive scene created by collecting old books.

A practical and aesthetic public sculpture to be shared with citizens.

A highly realistic painting of decayed people wearing Nazi uniforms.

Ryu Miyeon's body naturally leaned forward, intrigued by the images that were far more interesting than expected.

The artworks were so compelling that her composed posture and proper demeanor could not help but falter.

Even though they were just small photos, Ryu Miyeon felt a chill as she rubbed her neck and arms.

Her intuition was kicking in.

She regretted that there were only a few works in the portfolio.

"Does he not have many works, so he brought the actual painting? No, he said he would submit that painting for a solo exhibition. Then he must have many works... But can a freshman have a lot of works?"

Ryu Miyeon suddenly stood up and walked over to the painting Kang Lim had brought.

She kept swallowing, causing her throat to bob.

Facing the actual painting was entirely different from seeing a photo.

As she unwrapped the bubble wrap,

When she met the eyes of the woman in the painting,

Ryu Miyeon felt as if she had encountered something mystical, naturally falling into a reverie.

She recalled what her daughter had said at the auction house.

[His works feel truly alive. They make you feel like you are right there in that place, even though there's nothing around you...]

"Oh my... Seoyeon's eyes weren't wrong... I was the one who didn't see it. I was the one with biases."

In retrospect, her daughter had been odd.

When she talked about Michelangelo's Pieta or when she bought Yan Jun's painting,

She spoke proudly as if it was natural to compare them.

She should have thought it was strange back then...

With her senses and nerves sharpened, Ryu Miyeon realized one thing.

She had almost missed a very important person.
