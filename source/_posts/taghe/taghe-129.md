## Episode 129: Round-Robin Song

"Isn't it going to collapse? It didn't seem like there were this many at first."

"Right? Where did he gather all that stuff from?"

The students were surprised to see the pile of furniture at Baudouin's partition.

Though it was just ordinary desks, chairs, and drawers, the sheer quantity was overwhelming.

Kang Lim examined the artwork closely. The number of items wasn’t the issue.

The interesting part was that the furniture seemed incomplete.

Chairs and desks had one leg cut off, making them tilt.

Drawers were split in half, making them unusable for storage.

The cuts were quite sharp, suggesting they weren’t simply broken and discarded.

"He cut them himself. Why did he do that? What’s the meaning...?"

As Kang Lim was speculating, Baudouin stepped forward.

Seeing Professor Alfonso’s intrigued expression, Baudouin felt half the success of his presentation was already secured.

He steadied his trembling voice and began to speak.

"Hello. I expressed 'freedom.' I thought from the perspective of trees and created the artwork."

The students listened intently to Baudouin.

They were curious about what he meant by thinking from the perspective of trees.

"As you all know, trees are just trees. They live among their kind in the forest. They wouldn’t have imagined becoming desks or chairs among humans. It’s too different from their original form."

Baudouin approached the chair he had cut.

"So I cut off the legs, making it an unusable chair. In other words, I gave 'freedom' to these trees. They were never meant to support someone’s weight."

The students burst into laughter at the interesting idea. It sounded a bit like mockery.

This wasn’t what he wanted. Baudouin, looking slightly flustered, pointed to the furniture.

"Desks, drawers, wardrobes... I cut them all to make them unusable. I deprived them of their utility. As I said earlier, from a human perspective, they are crippled, but from the tree’s perspective, it’s freedom."

Baudouin placed his hand on his chest and continued.

"Human life is similar. Once we get a job, it becomes our entire life. Like trees, no one decides their job at birth. We squeeze ourselves into the mold as we live."

Baudouin brought out a chair he cherished most.

Most of the furniture was picked up from outside, but this one was different.

"This is the chair I have used since childhood. I lived like this chair. My parents had a specific job they wanted for me, and I spent decades trying to live up to it.

Of course, I left that behind and entered school to become an artist at an older age. People might see me as a fool who can’t take care of himself, like this chair that can’t fulfill its function."

Kang Lim examined the small chair.

It was covered with flower patterns, making it stand out compared to the other furniture.

‘What kind of story does Baudouin have?’

By his size, it seemed he lived a comfortable life without much hardship...

But you can’t judge a person by their appearance.

Kang Lim observed his expression.

There was a deep shadow in Baudouin’s eyes.

With a somewhat sad face, Baudouin spoke.

"In conclusion, this chair that appears crippled symbolizes 'freedom.' It’s a struggle to reclaim its original life from the carpenter who tried to define it. That’s why I like this broken form."

As the presentation ended, Alfonso and the students began to speak.

A heated debate ensued, more intense than before.

"It's too personal a piece. It can’t be expanded socially."

"How does a pile of furniture show freedom? It's hard to grasp Baudouin's thoughts."

"Judging by the image, it would be better to say it expresses compassion and comfort."

"Right. He relies too much on words. Can we understand the intent without explanation? It's almost better to see it as the entanglement of human misery."

Baudouin lowered his head at the barrage of critiques.

Though it was an honest piece, the response was not as positive as he had hoped.

"Duchamp brought a urinal and exhibited it as an object to show that objects could be art. As the students said, no lengthy explanation was needed. Baudouin should study readymade art more. A more intuitive image is necessary."

Even Alfonso seemed to think the students had a point.

'Sigh. Another failed assignment. I worked hard gathering these...'

Just as he was thinking that, Kang Lim’s voice was heard.

Is he going to add more criticism? Baudouin looked up at him.

"I think the perspective of seeing objects anew is excellent. The idea of approaching from the tree’s standpoint was unique and good. Also, an artist’s work inevitably reflects their life, making it inherently personal."

Contrary to Baudouin’s expectation, Kang Lim had positive words.

Rather than criticize, Kang Lim suggested new possibilities.

"The idea is good, so just changing the image a bit should work. Personally, I liked the chair Baudouin used since childhood. If the main piece is a piece of furniture that can’t fulfill its function, you don’t need many items; just that one will suffice. Make it memorable."

Kang Lim began sketching in his notebook.

It was a sketch using kinetic art.

"Though others see it as crippled, the goal of pursuing one's own path is the 'freedom' Baudouin speaks of, right? So, if you detach the chair legs, attach motors to the joints to make it move like a limping person, it would be interesting. Cut the legs at different heights so it barely manages to walk. It can’t be sat on, but it gains new value by being able to walk by itself."

Baudouin’s mind filled with new ideas as Kang Lim spoke.

Various scenarios of gaining new abilities, even if not sitting, came to mind.

"Not just moving motors, adding lights would be fun too!"

Baudouin took out a drawing book from his pocket.

Ideas continued to unfold on the clean paper.

Alfonso smiled as he watched Baudouin’s sketches.

Kang Lim’s critique was injecting new vitality into the other students.

So, what about Kang Lim’s own work?

Unable to contain his curiosity, Alfonso quickly walked over.

"Great presentation. Let’s move on to the next."

* * *

Others were just as curious.

Following the crowd of students, Alfonso entered Kang Lim’s area.

A massive tree was reflected in his blue eyes.

A huge old tree stood tall enough to surpass the partition.

Alfonso felt the passage of years from the dead tree.

Without needing words of consolation, it was evident that it had endured storms and harsh winters.

The stubborn grain of the tree bore the scars.

The holes that pierced its hard exterior told the story of the tree’s life.

Alfonso looked at the dry roots exposed above the ground.

A tree too tough to even use as firewood...

The weight of sorrow was felt from its already met demise.

Between the massive stump, there was a large knot big enough for a person to enter.

As trees age, their insides decay and hollow out.

"There was something like this in Alouville-Bellefosse. A tree that lived for 1,200 years. Inside, there was a small chapel for prayers..."

Recalling his hometown in Normandy, Alfonso closed his eyes.

Swoosh—

The sound of wind came from afar.

The wind ran across endless green hills.

Weaving from highlands to low meadows.

The wind passed the meandering river, shaking the branches of the forest vigorously.

The sound of ice breaking near the lake and water trickling down was heard.

The rustling of leaves grew louder.

Though they drooped from rain, they sparkled as if nothing had happened once the sun rose.

Brilliant new sprouts. The vibrant colors of the forest unfolded.

When the chirping of birds mixed in, Alfonso opened his eyes wide.

It wasn't possible to imagine this far.

“What... It was the sound from the clock?”

He opened his eyes and looked around.

Due to the giant painting in the center, he had forgotten about the digital clock.

"Wow. It seems the sound comes out at the set time."

"Olivia, did you participate too?"

"Yes. Kang Lim asked me to set it to an unforgettable, nostalgic time, so I set it to the date of the last pie my grandma made."

"It must have been special."

"Yes. It was my birthday."

"...But, you’re not crying, are you?"

"It’s just so wonderful. Playing forest sounds in front of a dead tree."

Listening to the students’ conversation, Alfonso realized this was participatory art.

It was a new work that combined traditional painting with advanced technology.

"Um, can I start the presentation?"

At Kang Lim’s question, Alfonso, still slightly dazed, nodded.

He pulled a few students out of their reverie.

There would be much to learn from the presentation, so they needed to focus.

Kang Lim looked into the students’ eyes as he spoke.

It was as if they already understood without needing an explanation.

"I expressed 'time and freedom.' The theme of my upcoming exhibition is 'Life and Death,' and I thought this material suited the title well. Life is the time we’ve lived, and death is the freedom from it."

Kang Lim took out clocks from a shelf. They had the same design but different colors.

Black, gray, and white—various neutral tones.

"I asked the audience to set a precious time, a memory that can’t be experienced again. It could also be a moment they want to relive."

Kang Lim showed the three types of clocks.

Though time flows the same, the methods to set the alarm varied.

"You can set it by year and date using a calendar, by specific time when an event occurred, or just by the age you experienced. You just turn the back of the clock to change the numbers."

Kang Lim explained the conditions for the alarm to ring.

"Each clock has a sensor, so the alarm only rings when the viewer is close for a certain time. The sound plays only when someone pays attention to someone else’s memory. It represents recalling memories."

Kang Lim stood quietly in front of a clock that wasn’t ringing.

After a moment, as he said, the sound of wind began to play.

"I wanted to capture the longing for what’s absent through sound. You see a dead tree, but you hear rustling leaves."

Kang Lim returned the clock to its place.

Alfonso felt the grid-patterned shelf looked like an urn.

"Everyone dies. But no one lives preparing for it. They think it’s a distant matter.

At Kang Lim’s words, everyone nodded.

Death always comes as an unexpected shock.

A baby born tomorrow might die before you.

Even if ill, the approaching end is another story.

Those left behind only regret in the face of death.

Why didn’t they realize sooner...?

"Why do we always realize too late? Time passes fleetingly. In the face of death, all humans can do is recall memories.

While creating this space, I wanted to give freedom to those left behind. I thought it would be nice if they could feel the deceased living in their memories.

Visitors will participate in the exhibition by receiving notes. When the alarm rings, they can reset their memory to stop the sound.

This is our round-robin song. Even those who haven’t faced death will know they’ll remain a precious memory to someone someday. Many people gather to share time."

Listening to Kang Lim, Alfonso nodded.

A sanctuary-like area. A meditative work that seemed to release old sorrows and grant freedom to both the dead and the living.

"It’s an excellent piece. Typically, traditional painting and digital art don’t mix well... You used contrasting elements to create a dramatic effect. Looking at the dead tree, I recalled its vibrant days. It was moving without needing words."

Students agreed with Alfonso’s praise.

Among them was Baudouin, who saw the piece late after organizing his thoughts.

Baudouin realized what Shin Taemin had said. Kang Lim was distinctly different from other students.

His sensory system was multidimensional. Being with him made Baudouin feel like a single-celled organism.

“Any questions?”

Kang Lim looked at the students with wide eyes.

Though their mouths were open, no one spoke.

After a while, a student finally asked.

“Why is the top of the tree cut off? Did the branches break because it got old? There are many dead trees that maintain their form, but the trunk seems too small for the massive stump.”

“You’re right, it’s small. The tree will expand. Right now, the space is too cramped to attach more paper. You’ll see the full form at the exhibition.”

“Wow...”

Students started buzzing again.

If exhibited on a larger scale, the impact would be immense.

With more clocks, the sound would amplify, creating the feeling of being in a forest.

‘There’s a secret in the old tree, but no one’s noticed...’

Contrary to the students’ admiration, Kang Lim ended the presentation with a slightly sullen expression.

Alfonso handed him a notebook with today’s date written on it.

“Today is an unforgettable moment for me, so set my alarm to this. I’ll definitely visit the exhibition.”

“Oh, thank you. Professor, I’ll deliver the catalog from the Barbara Gallery once it’s out.”

“Sure.”

Alfonso patted Kang Lim’s shoulder with a smile.

He thought Kang Lim’s work would be one of the greatest experiences of his life before he died.

It was an exhibition he wanted to see with his loved ones.
