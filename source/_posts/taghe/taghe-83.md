## Episode 83: The Second Solo Exhibition

Kang Lim locked the door of his studio and stepped into the hallway.

The empty hallway felt devoid of any human warmth.

Outside the window, the trees had only a few leaves left.

Perhaps because it was already winter, it felt inexplicably lonely.

‘Even though the Heyum residency only accepts a few people... why are there so few around?’

Typically, the residency period for corporate or museum residencies is 1-2 years.

The number of people selected each year ranges from 10 to 20.

Heyum, however, uniquely does not set a fixed number of participants.

Maybe their intent is to select fewer people and provide better support.

Often, only one or two people are selected, making it newsworthy just to be accepted into the Heyum residency.

‘It's nice that the allocated studio is spacious because there are fewer people, but it's a shame that I can't interact with many artists.’

Various residency artists passed through Kang Lim's mind.

Many, like Kang Lim, were unknown but gained fame after receiving support here.

They were distinctive artists with their own well-defined worldviews.

‘I don't know where they are now, but...’

Bzzzz-

While moving towards Heyum, Kang Lim answered his phone.

It was his mother.

[Did you see the photo I just sent?]

“Yes, I was just about to reply.”

[How is it? Pretty, right?]

“It looks like a monk's robe, but I like it. Or should I say, it looks like Kim Satgat’s?”

[Oh, you... Are you joking? Where would you find such a stylish monk's robe! I bought it to match the theme of ‘Gray Human’ from your solo exhibition.]

“Yes, yes, I'm joking. This is for me to wear at the opening, right?”

[Hahaha. Of course!]

“Got it. Thank you.”

[Is this what a celebrity coordinator feels like?]

“Haha... I wouldn't know, I haven't done it. I think I'll be home the day after tomorrow.”

[Alright! I miss you. Son, fighting.]

“Yep.”

Even after hanging up, his mother's lively voice lingered in his ears.

They say that a child's success is the best way to show filial piety, and it seems true.

Kang Lim smiled and put his phone back in his pocket.

His hands felt warmer than before.

After taking a few more steps, he arrived in front of the main building's planning office.

Kang Lim felt a slight sense of tension at the door.

Perhaps because he thought of the director, it felt a bit different from when he had met Seo Hee for tutoring.

* * *

Ryu Miyeon greeted Kang Lim with a warm smile.

Her elegant appearance was always impressive.

“Kang Lim, the opening is soon. I saw the installation, and it's really good.”

“Thank you.”

“Are you feeling alright? I heard you stayed up late modifying things until just a few days ago.”

“Yes, I'm fine. Seo Yeon helped a lot.”

“Haha, yes. She worked hard writing the preface and making the catalog. It must have been tough for both of you since you're students.”

“No, the installation team had it the hardest. They helped a lot, so it was easy for me.”

“That's a relief.”

Kang Lim glanced at the file on Ryu Miyeon's desk.

The title on the file read "Residency Results Report."

It summarized the exhibitions and project work done by the resident artists.

Seeing Kang Lim's curiosity, Ryu Miyeon spoke.

“Are you curious about that?”

“Yes, I was wondering why there are so few people at the residency.”

“Group A is in Paris, and Group B is in New York. They're busy with their respective projects. You'll meet them soon.”

“Oh... That's why it's empty.”

“Actually, I called you to talk about that.”

Ryu Miyeon handed Kang Lim a prepared envelope.

“We're planning a relay solo exhibition with the residency artists, and the theme is ‘Intersection.’ Inside, there's a blueprint of Heyum in Paris, so think about what kind of exhibition you want to plan and prepare the works you want to take. It might be a bit tight, but you'll be leaving the Sunday after next.”

“No, it's enough time. The theme also suits me well.”

“Haha, everyone says that. That the theme matches them well.”

“Well, when you gather artists with strong personalities, you need a broad theme.”

“See, you're good at planning too. I knew I could trust you with this.”

Ryu Miyeon looked at Kang Lim with a satisfied expression.

Kang Lim tried to calm his excitement.

‘When was the last time I flew... I only flew once when I went to Jeju Island. This will be fun. I'll be able to see masterpieces I've only read about in books, right?’

The thought of going abroad for work made him feel like something big was happening.

He didn't want to show his excitement like a child, but...

“Oh, and one more thing. Could you prepare the <Woojukdo> you painted for the Korean Art Exhibition? You can mount it on a scroll or fix it on a panel.”

“Yes, I can prepare that in a day. But why?”

“We're going to put it on K-Auction. Being exhibited at Heyum means there's no one in the Korean art world who doesn't know you. While you're shining as a promising artist, you should put out a piece. What do you think?”

“Um... I'm fine with it, but isn't ink wash painting still unpopular?”

“That's true for overseas auctions. But there are more enthusiasts than you think in domestic auctions.”

“Oh, really?”

This was another unfamiliar world to Kang Lim.

‘I want to go and see it out of curiosity, but would appearing at the auction ruin the mystique...’

After some thought, Kang Lim spoke.

“Can I go and watch too?”

* * *

The large window was covered with crimson blackout curtains.

They were for the owner who stayed up late reading.

Pushing one bookshelf revealed another bookshelf.

The massive library-like study was filled with books from various fields.

Books neatly organized by height and thickness...

Shin Hansu pulled out the thickest hardcover.

As he slowly turned the pages while seated, the smell of old paper wafted out.

‘Ha... I can't concentrate.’

Shin Hansu was preoccupied with an undecided matter.

He closed the book again and turned on his computer.

He read an already-read email once more.

The sender was Ryu Miyeon, the director of Heyum.

[Hello, Professor Shin Hansu. This program is for the artists at the Paris residency...]

The goal of the residency is to enhance the artists' creative capabilities.

They create curated exhibitions, hold open studios and workshops, and run various projects.

Among these, the most important service is matching artists with critics one-on-one.

Ryu Miyeon had sent a solicitation email to Shin Hansu, the most famous critic in the industry.

However, famous critics usually do not participate in such programs.

They cannot afford to spend time following new artists abroad.

‘Normally, I would have deleted it without even reading...’

He sighed and rubbed his face.

The name of the matched artist bothered him.

The name Kang Lim.

Shin Hansu recalled his memories related to Kang Lim.

It felt like meeting those clear eyes again.

Old memories should fade, but Kang Lim's first impression was too strong.

‘Even during the first class, I thought he was unique, but his solo exhibition was beyond imagination.’

He had first glimpsed Kang Lim's inner world in a dark exhibition hall.

A painting capturing someone's life... The emotional brushstrokes deeply resonated with him.

Even the format of the canvas frame shattered conventional thinking.

When he realized the angle of the two opposing sides gradually decreased, he got goosebumps.

He was a very curious artist, always making one wonder what he would create next.

He exited the email screen and opened the search engine.

The search rankings already included not only ‘Kang Lim’ but also related terms like ‘Heyum Museum’ and ‘Heyum Museum location.’

Such reach could draw even those unfamiliar with art to visit.

[The Youngest National Representative Artist is Born!]

[Prodigy Painter Kang Lim's Second Solo Exhibition.]

[Kang Lim to Challenge Guinness World Record with the Largest Painting in the World?]

[A Young Artist, Kang Lim, Breathes New Life into the Stagnant Korean Art Scene.]

Shin Hansu clicked on the main article among the flood of reports.

The view count was unbelievable for a cultural arts section.

[Heyum Museum to Hold Kang Lim's Solo Exhibition <Cyclic Spectrum>.]

The artist Kang Lim (19), who exploded his potential at his solo exhibition at Baekyeon Gallery, returns.

Kang Lim's second solo exhibition, <Cyclic Spectrum>, will be held at Heyum Museum from December 12th to April 12th next year.

Since Heyum, a leading Korean museum, has never held a solo exhibition for a new artist, it’s garnering significant industry attention.

Kang Lim, who has been active since the age of 6, will reveal large-scale works he has been painting over the years.

These paintings reimagine the Bukhansan mountain range from the artist's perspective, explored from middle school to high school.

This work also combines past works with new additions, creating a unique fusion of past and future.

Ryu Miyeon (44), the director of Heyum Museum, said, "While the current exhibit is 500 meters in length, it will continue to evolve throughout the 5-month exhibition period. The piece, which merges beginning and end into eternity, showcases the artist's worldview and is especially significant as it was created entirely under Kang Lim's direction. This exhibition confirms that Kang Lim has not only the talent of an artist but also the skills of a curator, a critical ability for contemporary artists who must handle space."

Kang Lim also expressed his confidence, saying, "Like a unit of light breaking into various colors depending on the wavelength in a spectrum, I will show the continuous cyclic process of nature in diverse ways."

<Cyclic Spectrum> is set to be listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for being over three times the size of Monet's large Water Lilies series.

Currently, Kang Lim is studying at the Korea National University of Arts and has been selected as a participating artist for next year's Venice Biennale.

Known as the Olympics of the art world, the Venice Biennale is the largest art exhibition in the world, and being the youngest participant will likely draw even more attention to Kang Lim.

└ Seriously, what did I just read...

└ Yep, his portrait work last time was amazing too.

Shin Hansu pressed his temples.

Reading the noisy comments gave him a headache.

Seeing unrefined words was an ordeal for him.

‘Since he also curated it, it's a must-see exhibition... I'll decide whether to join as a residency critic after seeing it.’

* * *

A few days later, at the solo exhibition opening.

In the waiting room, Kang Lim recalled the catering food.

Sandwiches with fresh vegetables arranged by color.

Canapés neatly placed on a three-tier tray.

Puddings and fruits in beautiful cocktail glasses.

Even wine to enhance the flavor.

He had never seen food so beautifully arranged before.

The visualization of taste. No wonder there are food stylists.

‘You really lose out if you don't attend an opening at an art museum. There are so many events.’

Seo Yeon watched Kang Lim with curiosity beside him.

He looked pleased and didn't seem nervous.

“Usually, only world-renowned artists come to Heyum, so I've never seen anyone nervous before an opening... You're similar to those artists? Impressive, I'm the one feeling nervous.”

Kang Lim smiled faintly.

He seemed very relaxed.

“Well, of course. I've already experienced it at Baekyeon Gallery.”

“There will be far more reporters than back then.”

“Well, no matter how many, how many could there be.”

Seo Yeon checked the time and spoke.

“We should go now! Let's move.”

Kang Lim followed Seo Yeon out the door.

As they passed through the exhibition hall and approached the entrance, a white table came into view in the distance.

He wasn't nervous earlier, but now his heart raced with each step.

The moment he passed through the entrance and the door closed.

The overwhelming cheers and flashes of lightning began.

There were so many clapping hands that they seemed to sparkle.

With the endless camera shutters, Kang Lim couldn't keep his eyes open for even a second.
