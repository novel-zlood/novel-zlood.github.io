## Episode 27: Juyoung Juhyung

Most mock-up design works are made by machines, so choosing the right production company is crucial.

Prices vary greatly since there isn't a fixed rate, and it's important to check if they are using the latest and best machines.

However, Kang Lim entered a small alley far from Euljiro Station without hesitation.

Since he attended design college before, he had already explored the area.

“Wow. It’s already changing bit by bit. I came here when I was making my graduation project...”

In the future, Euljiro will see many buildings converted into cafes and restaurants while keeping the existing shops intact.

In a few years, with the rise of social media, it will become a retro hotspot.

More young people will come to enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of signless shops while maintaining the old building forms.

“Oh, there it is. Juyoung Juhyung.”

Kang Lim entered between an old, rundown bar and a cafe.

In between them was "Juyoung Juhyung."

“Though it looks like this on the outside, this is the best workshop.”

The owner couldn’t open a shop near the station because he spent a lot on good machines.

Only regular customers who knew well used this place; the location was an issue, but the senseless sign name also played a part.

Most 3D modeling companies use the words ‘CNC, 3D Printer’ on their signs...

This person named it Juhyung, boasting that the quality seemed like it was hand-made.

The reason it’s called ‘Juyoung Juhyung’ is that the owner’s name is Juyoung...

“Hello.”

Zzz- Zzz-

As the door opened, the sound of a printer producing a large banner could be heard.

“Oh! You’re here to pick up your order, right? What’s your name again?”

“Yes, I’m Kang Lim. I uploaded the web hard file last week.”

“Oh, last week!”

Kim Juyoung opened a list with a yellow bookmark.

It was a well-known place, so there were quite a lot of orders piled up.

“Ah, you’re the one who ordered the butterfly and bee.”

“Yes, that’s right.”

“It’s just coming out now. You can take it in about 30 minutes!”

“Oh, it’s fresh off the press.”

“Haha. That’s right. Come and see.”

Kang Lim followed Kim Juyoung to the 3D printer.

“How did you model it so well? You look young. Is this for your graduation project?”

“No, this is just an assignment.”

“Wow... You’re putting your soul into an assignment. You’re a diligent student, huh?”

“Haha, not really. There’s a display contest too, so I tried hard. Even if it costs some money, I can make up for it with the prize money.”

“That's good. If the quality of this decoration is like this, the entire project must be top-notch. I thought Pixar sent it.”

The 3D printer was solidifying the liquid-form raw material according to the calculated shape.

Exactly the butterfly shape Kang Lim wanted was coming out.

The texture even included soft fine hairs on the wings.

“I’ve never seen rendering this realistic.”

“There’s a machine here that can pull that off.”

“Wow- you speak so nicely, student.”

“Haha.”

In his past life, the old man used to scold him for delivering shoddy work, saying the machine was wasted on him.

Was he always this gentle?

Receiving only compliments was amusing.

“But what kind of butterfly is it? A tiger swallowtail?”

“Yes, it’s in the tiger swallowtail family. It’s called a jabinabi.”

“Oh, there are butterflies that big.”

“The wingspan is about 7 centimeters. Its body and wings are almost black, but the tail part gradually turns blue, which is the highlight.”

“That must be really mystical.”

“Right. It will stand out a lot among bright flowers since the colors are vivid and simple.”

“Then painting the colors must be important. You’re not leaving the painting to us?”

Oh, this old man.

Kang Lim knew Mr. Kim Juyoung wasn’t good at painting.

Besides, commissioning hand-painting would significantly raise the cost.

It was obviously better to receive the model and paint it with acrylic paint himself.

“No, I’ll paint it myself.”

“Hm- okay.”

Kim Juyoung smacked his lips regretfully.

Kang Lim smiled and opened his phone to check messages from other team members.

As expected, the most photos came from Yoon Jangmi, who had the most work.

[Yoon Jangmi: (photo), (photo), (photo) How about these flowers?]

As expected of a craft major artist.

The petals had such delicate details that they seemed touchable.

[Kang Lim: They’re perfect, Noona. I’ll help with the rest. I’m done with my work too.]

[Yoon Jangmi: Ha. Thank goodness. There was too much. What’s Lee Hyunseong doing?]

[Kang Lim: He’s busy too. He has a lot to do.]

[Yoon Jangmi: ...What on earth is he doing.]

Kang Lim chuckled and closed his phone.

This group project felt really promising.

Three weeks later. Assignment presentation day.

Han Jungpil entered the classroom, anticipating what kind of assignments the students had brought.

Everyone looked tired from meeting the deadline, but looking around, there seemed to be quite decent works.

“You all worked hard. Since the display size was quite large, it would have been difficult to produce quality work in just three weeks.”

“Ugh...”

Groans of exhaustion could be heard here and there.

“However, the result is always objective. If you don’t get good feedback here, winning a competition is out of the question.”

“I hope we at least get an honorable mention...”

Listening to the students’ grumbling, Han Jungpil chuckled.

“What’s important is to identify what’s good and what to avoid by looking at each other’s work. When presenting your group’s work, actively participate in the evaluation. The group that gives good advice will get extra points.”

“Yes!”

“We’ll present in the order of the practical room seats.”

As soon as Han Jungpil finished speaking, the group seated at partition 1 came forward with their work.

It was a group of kids who were happy to be composed solely of design majors.

A student who seemed to be the group leader stepped forward to explain the work.

“Hello. Our group prepared the basic product display for Corial Fresh’s newly announced product. Interestingly, this product has both moisturizing and whitening functions. We designed it to highlight those features.”

Cosmetics were displayed with a background of blue sky and sea.

The work stood out with its unevenly carved and hole-punched Iso Pink, resembling basalt.

The white droplet-shaped packages were placed in tiers on stacked stones, reminiscent of Jeju’s stone walls.

“Wow... It’s pretty. Refreshing.”

“Yeah. It looks moisturizing.”

“It kind of feels like Udo.”

The sky and sea seemed meticulously painted.

To Kang Lim, the detailing seemed too weak and would have been better as a photo, but the kids’ reactions were surprisingly good.

‘The initial colors are refreshing and visually appealing, so they’re reacting like this. My eyes are a bit sensitive too...’

The first element of design, aesthetics, was somewhat satisfied with the work.

“Right. We wanted to express the volcanic rock water from Jeju and hyaluronic acid used in this product. We aimed for a moist and refreshing feel. And we included a humorous element.”

“Humorous element? What’s funny about it?”

“If you look closely, the path between the stones is actually modeled after a real path leading to a lighthouse. Since this product has a whitening function, we represented the package itself as a lighthouse.”

Again, the kids showered compliments.

‘Oh. Clever. Saying the product package is set up like a lighthouse makes it more interesting.’

But Lee Hyunseong raised his hand, looking disapproving.

“Humor? Corial Fresh’s target customers are a bit older. Isn’t this a bit of a stretch?”

Kang Lim sighed in frustration.

Lee Hyunseong had misunderstood when he said not to use funny codes.

There are various kinds of humor, but he didn’t get it.

‘No, this level of freshness is fine. The problem was your Disney princess character jokes...’

In the end, voices complaining about Lee Hyunseong erupted.

“Just because the target is older doesn’t mean this clever humor won’t work. It’s not like they made a dad joke or harmed the brand image.”

“Yeah. The idea is good.”

Surrounded by criticism, Lee Hyunseong looked at Kang Lim in confusion.

Why are you looking at me? You messed up.

Although Kang Lim glared coldly at him, he felt a pang of sympathy.

This guy also worked hard on the project, suffering due to Kang Lim’s picky requests...

Reluctantly, Kang Lim started to critique to support his shrinking team member.

“I think the idea is pretty decent. But there’s a reason why using a lighthouse in the display doesn’t make sense.”

“Is that group just criticizing for the sake of it?”

“No. When doing displays, there’s something more important than the product’s functionality.”

Han Jungpil’s ears perked up at Kang Lim’s words.

He couldn’t understand why the kids had praised this work so much.

“The most important thing is the product’s package design. From the start, this company made the product in a droplet shape. This means they focused on moisture more than whitening. In other words, setting it up like a lighthouse on the sea lacks conviction.”

“Wow... That’s true.”

Only then did the students start noticing the display’s flaws.

“And if you wanted to emphasize whitening, using a bright daytime background was a mistake. A dark night sea would have been better. The white product package would stand out more, naturally emphasizing its functionality. Lighthouses shine at night, right?”

Han Jungpil keenly observed Kang Lim, who had provided a perfect solution.

This... no wonder there were rumors that Professor Koo Haeyoung treasured him.

“That was an excellent point. Let’s give extra points to Kang Lim’s group.”

At Han Jungpil’s words, Lee Hyunseong sighed in relief.

He thought they were going to lose points, but Kang Lim turned it into a plus.

Han Jungpil checked the score sheet and spoke again.

“And it’s evident you worked hard, but the quality of the depiction seems lacking. Did you draw it by hand to consider the sculpture art department? It wasn’t necessary... As you know, this is a common practical class. It would have been fine to use the tools that design students excel at. It’s a shame. Personally, I think a photo background would have been cleaner.”

Hearing the professor’s assessment, the presenting students lowered their heads.

Only Lee Hyunseong grinned and whispered to Kang Lim.

“Hey, we’re going to win. No doubt.”

Had he forgotten how good Professor Han Jungpil’s hearing was? Here we go again. He must be a fool by now.

Was his memory that of a goldfish...? Kang Lim felt like sharing his memory with him.

“Okay. Next group, please come forward.”

Han Jungpil smirked slightly and looked at Kang Lim.
