## Episode 88: Adrenaline

4 PM. After the chief auctioneer's opening declaration.

Forty minutes have already passed.

The president of the Korean Art Association checked the time, waiting for Kang Lim's work.

"They've arranged the order with care… The selection of auction items is crucial, too, as it follows a flow."

To raise the atmosphere initially, they placed popular works.

Paintings that anyone could easily bid on and understand.

After that, they positioned relatively lesser-known artists, and just when things might get boring, they presented high-priced works.

In this way, when prices wildly fluctuate, adrenaline automatically gets pumped.

To fetch high prices, you need to unsettle the bidders' psychology.

"But today, all the guests look bored."

The president looked around.

Everyone seemed like they were about to lose their patience waiting for their chosen paintings.

They were all recognizable wealthy individuals and celebrities.

"They wouldn't send proxies to an auction, after all. It's easy to make mistakes if swayed on the spot. People with a keen eye come in person…."

The president chuckled, thinking of Kang Lim.

"A mere twenty-year-old is making these rich folks anxious… The world is really funny."

"He acts so indifferent, as if he doesn't care at all, while watching people struggle behind the scenes."

At that moment, the auctioneer's words echoed in his ears.

"The next piece is Kang Lim's <Bamboo Forest>. We will reveal it on the spot."

The president snapped to attention.

As he sharply raised his head, his glasses fell to the ground.

His secretary, who was next to him, offered to pick them up, but in his haste, he fumbled around on the floor.

Staff members wearing white gloves brought out the artwork.

As soon as the painting was revealed, the room buzzed with excitement.

He needed to see the source of this chaos quickly...

His mind was racing, and he couldn't see anything in front of him.

In the end, the secretary picked up the glasses first.

"…Here they are."

"Th-thank you."

When the president learned about the Four Gentlemen (plum, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum), there were words that stuck with him.

"Ink has colors. It's not just black, so tube paints can't replicate it.

It's not about being proud of Korean painting; it's a scientific fact.

The degree to which the particles disperse light differs based on their size.

Especially when it meets porous Korean paper, this effect is maximized.

Dense ink actually has a cool blue hue. A very dark celadon blue.

On the other hand, the more diluted it gets, the more brown it becomes. Smaller particles disperse more light.

Soot left from burning wood...

The soot itself is the ink.

Really skilled ink painters even use these colors."

Today, he finally met such an artist.

Kang Lim's painting was precisely that.

A bamboo forest painted with light ink.

He layered even lighter rain on top, overlapping the ink.

The colors became warmer than if he had painted it densely in one go.

With a sepia tone covering the entire canvas, it exuded a nostalgic rain scent.

It evoked damp and painful memories...

"A full ink painting without empty space, yet it feels both full and empty…."

A heavy downpour overwhelmed the canvas.

A densely painted bamboo forest like a torrential rain.

Sharp raindrops violently shaking the leaves as if to tear them apart.

"President, please sit down."

The secretary pulled his arm, and the president sat down in his chair.

She looked embarrassed, but he didn't feel ashamed.

Everyone had faces drenched in the downpour.

"Because of the quickly brushed strokes, even in the wetness, dry brush effects appeared… Thanks to the whitish parts, the rain sounds even rougher…."

The president quietly closed his eyes.

As the painting faded, other sounds emerged between the rain.

.

.

"55.5 million won."

"56 million won."

"56.5 million won."

"57 million won!"

"57.5 million won!"

.

.

The sound of prices soaring.

It was time to snap out of it. He absolutely wanted to get this painting.

He had to do his best, as much as he could.

The president's eyes opened wide, and he grabbed the bidding paddle.

"60 million won."

The chief auctioneer, sweating, read the bid. Everyone was raising their hands, making it hard to determine who went first.

The weight of the pressure on her shoulders.

She spoke with a slightly flustered expression.

"If we keep the increments low, the auction won't end today."

"From now on, we will raise the bid by 3 million won each time."

That evening at Kang Lim's home.

Im Yujin was having dinner with her husband.

With a voice without much inflection and clear pronunciation.

Drinking soup while watching the usual expressionless face of the anchor.

Clicking their tongues together with her husband, criticizing the world and wondering how such scammers exist.

Every day, the same incidents, slightly varied.

Im Yujin, with a face showing there was nothing more to see, said,

"Should we turn off the TV?"

"Yeah, it's better to watch a drama later."

"But these days, dramas aren't even fun."

"Haha. That's true. Isn't there any fun drama?"

Just as Im Yujin was about to turn off the TV,

A familiar face appeared on the screen.

"What… Isn't that Kang Lim?"

"Huh? Our son?"

Both of their eyes turned to the TV simultaneously.

They put down their spoons, and their upper bodies naturally leaned forward.

No matter how much they looked, it was definitely their son inside that screen. There's no way parents wouldn't recognize their child's face.

Behind Kang Lim's photo was an ink painting of bamboo.

The headline below read,

"Kang Lim, the highest price for contemporary Korean painting. Sold for 2.2 billion won."

Their mouths opened wide like caves.

Life is more interesting than drama.

"Let's get more details from reporter Kim Sangjun on the ground. Kim Sangjun."

The screen split, and the reporter's face appeared.

"Yes, this is K Auction. It's the number one auction house in our country. Major auctions are held four times a year, and during this year's fourth-quarter winter auction, something extraordinary happened. It's unimaginable for a new artist to fetch such a high price. The atmosphere at the scene is also one of disbelief."

The anchor asked,

"Although Kang Lim is a rising star in the art world, he's relatively inexperienced. How did he fetch such a high price?"

"The price of an artwork is determined by various factors, including the artist's life narrative and philosophy, the number of works they own, exhibition history, and the unique value of the artwork. It appears that Kang Lim has no shortcomings in these areas.

Although he has a short exhibition history, his recent successful exhibition at a major museum representing Korea seems to have played a significant role."

"Can you elaborate on other factors besides his exhibition history?"

The reporter approached Kang Lim's <Bamboo Forest> displayed at the auction house.

"Yes. This work has value in reconnecting the broken tradition of Korean literati painting. Since Japanese colonial rule, few artists have continued traditional practices, which sparked greater competition among Korean painting enthusiasts."

"I heard there was a 'rally,' where the price kept rising."

"That's correct. The auctioneer said it's common for high-selling works to rise about 20% from the estimated price, but it's unprecedented for a piece to rise fourfold."

"Amazing. What's the industry's evaluation?"

"The industry's evaluation is sharply divided."

Listening to the happy news, both of them gulped.

So, it's not all praise… They were worried about negative comments.

"Those who can't accept the price say it's not a representative work of Kang Lim, yet it sold at a high price. They argue that a 210-round bidding battle at a live auction is unprecedented and attribute it to excessive competition among Korean painting enthusiasts."

"But isn't it natural for auction prices to be higher than gallery sales, due to competition?"

"Yes. Since Kang Lim's work was first released without a market price, unforeseen events seem to have occurred."

"Are there experts who believe the high price is justified?"

"Yes, there are."

Hearing this, the parents sighed in relief.

"One expert said that <Bamboo Forest> is a paradoxical painting that shows an empty heart by filling the blank space, reflecting the artist's signature style, making it inherently expensive. The artist's unique philosophy is vividly expressed.

Additionally, since Kang Lim mainly releases series works, it's unlikely for a single piece to come up for auction. Due to its rarity, when one does come up, people feel the need to buy it."

The reporter stood at the auction entrance and concluded,

"Korean painting enthusiasts genuinely want to own his work. Isn't that the essence of art auctions? In an era overflowing with art investors treating paintings like stocks, who detest their works if prices drop even slightly,

If one can fully understand the value and derive spiritual satisfaction from genuinely liking the work, I think the value of <Bamboo Forest> is higher than today's sale price. This was Kim Sangjun reporting from the scene."

After the news ended, Im Yujin immediately picked up her phone.

As expected, the main portal site's homepage was filled with news about Kang Lim.

Ignoring her husband's attempt to stop her from reading the potentially negative comments...

She slowly read through the articles.

There will be many such incidents in the future; she needed to get used to it.

Im Yujin cautiously checked the comments as if walking on thin ice.

Fortunately, there were many praises and supportive comments.

Some people interpreted the artwork better than the reporters and anchors.

There are always some skilled writers among netizens.

- A bamboo forest in a torrential rain. No matter how much it rains, bamboo doesn't break. It resembles modern people living steadfastly in their strained lives. I feel a warm consolation amidst my tiring daily life. The water droplets falling from the leaf tips are sad, yet I feel cheered up.

└ LOL armchair critic.

└ It's expensive, but honestly, there are many expensive artworks.

└ Indeed, there are several living foreign artists with works worth hundreds of billions.

└ Isn't it a large piece, 120 ho? Consider that Ryu Junhee's 30 ho piece is 80 million won.

└ If he builds his career overseas, it will soar even more.

- Making 2.2 billion won at twenty, LOL. But I can't say I'll paint the same...

└ Those dissatisfied should visit the exhibition. You'll shut your mouth.

└ Right, they haven't seen it in person. It's just jealousy.

└ I acknowledge this artist.

└ Now that it's like this, I hope we have an artist in our country whose works are worth hundreds of billions!

- Good at traditional Asian painting too… ㅠㅠ

└ That's right. It's a completely different genre.

└ He paints ink paintings uniquely, LOL.

└ He won the grand prize in Korean painting at the Korean Art Exhibition.

Click-

At that moment, Kang Lim came in from outside.

In his right hand, he held a black plastic bag.

He had brought ice cream after dinner.

"Oh, Dad is here."

Kang Lim casually walked in and sat at the dining table.

He picked up his phone from the charger.

"What, why is everyone so silent?"

Stiff necks, eyes fixed on him.

Eyes burning with excitement...

His parents' mouths twitched slightly.

"Oh, the news came out, right? It's all over, I guess."

"Aren't you curious at all…?"

"You rascal, you should have told us this beforehand!"

Kang Lim burst into laughter and said,

"What, you'll be more surprised in the future… This much? Ink paintings aren't that expensive. How much did it sell for?"

As he turned on his phone, it buzzed like crazy again.

He was used to it by now.

Feeling the vibration leisurely, he checked his messages.

Starting with the most important ones.

[Ryu Miyeon: If you establish a corporation, you can manage the tax rates more favorably. Split the accounts, and create a stock account. You'll need to keep using it in the future. I've sent you an email on how to do it, along with the receipt. You've worked hard, and congratulations.]

"What… She's even worried about my taxes…."

Kang Lim opened the attachment and checked the receipt.

It was the file sent by the auction company.

"……?"

Kang Lim's eyes widened as he confirmed the sale price.

There were too many zeros, much more than he expected.

With furrowed brows, he counted the digits again, disbelieving.

He suspected the receipt was incorrect, but Ryu Miyeon's words lingered.

"Who on earth paid this much…?"

A blank stare. Rapidly blinking eyelids.

His parents, finding his expression amusing, burst into laughter simultaneously.

Then their whole bodies shook.

It was his father's congratulatory pat.

Saying he was proud, he roughly tousled his hair.

With a touched expression, Kang Lim said,

"Are we going to be able to live in an apartment soon?"

"Ha-ha-ha."

Bzzzz-

At that moment, another important message came in.

[Ha Baekyeon: Kang Lim, I heard the news. Congratulations. But you remember tomorrow is the day to clear out Baekyeon Gallery, right? If you come, I have good news to share. Someone wants to meet you.]
