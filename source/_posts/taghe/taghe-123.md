## Episode 123: Busy People


[Kang Lim's Black Hole Mesmerizes Paris]

(Photo) The solo exhibition <Black Hole> by R.F (Kang Lim) at the Leuxangbrug Heum Art Museum. The artist and the audience are engaged in conversation.

The identity of the artist R.F, who has sparked everyone's curiosity with his unique ideas, has been revealed.

R.F stands for River Forest, which signifies the meaning of his name, Kang Lim, representing river and forest.

On this day, R.F unveiled over 300 works he had accumulated in the exhibition hall. These paintings featured anonymous backs.

The paintings were hung in the air, and the space was transformed into a mirror room, a distinctive feature of this exhibition.

The audience experienced something strange in the black room where the images infinitely expanded.

Kang Lim's appearance in the dark reminded one of the man in René Magritte's painting, <Concord>.

In fact, the editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine ‘Runway’, Miko Futonen, who was present at the opening ceremony, was greatly shocked by his appearance.

He said, “There were many people standing in the black room, and it felt like it was pouring like rain. Kang Lim appeared in a Christian Dior Trapeze Line Balmacaan coat among them.

The raincoat line, first created by Yves Saint Laurent, boasted a mysterious silhouette and appropriately expressed the artist who had to pass through many people.

The clothes he wore inside had a pattern mixed with various fabrics, but the black color conveyed a silent scream. Kang Lim turned even his fashion into an exhibit.”

It was as shocking as when Jean-Michel Basquiat wore a Giorgio Armani suit and struck an arrogant pose.

Of course, Kang Lim exuded a much more contemplative atmosphere.

Joachim Kellen, a world-renowned critic, said, “There is a saying that life ultimately comes alone and leaves alone. It means everyone feels the weight of being responsible for their own lives. Kang Lim captured that weight using various fabrics.

Moreover, he vividly depicted loneliness in the crowd, re-examining our image oppressed by the social self.

The people who were too ordinary to empathize with, yet felt distant, provided a sense of unfamiliarity. I think of his paintings as ‘hyper-realistic surrealism.’”

Scholars noted that his work carries a signature of harmonizing conflicting elements.

This was true not only of the theme but also of the method of expression, which was surprising.

His first solo exhibition traversed between conceptual and abstract, and his second solo exhibition mixed materials from East and West.

“Ultimately, it is human memory that gives meaning to something,” Kang Lim had said.

He succeeded in exploring the meaning of existence, functioning each individual as its own.

<Black Hole> will be on display at the Heum Art Museum until March 20th.

Before spring arrives, it's recommended to experience the deep contemplation of an artist.

- It was my first time having such an experience at an exhibition.

└ It was the best exhibition I've ever seen. I still remember the person's back at the moment they kicked the ball. I really thought time had stopped!

└ I was captivated by the person feeding pigeons. The brush stroke at the moment they got up from the chair was so sensuous.

└ Although it was a bit eerie to see only backs, I fully felt Kang Lim's heart.

└ Me too. I wondered how far I could embrace all those numerous strangers.

└ Perhaps the back is more honest than the face. We live with a social mask on.

- Ordinary daily life, fleeting time, and various people create a strange scenery. This is art.

└ I was in a place where people of different nationalities, races, genders, and ages were mixed.

└ The fashion sense was also excellent. Speaking in French with a calm, low voice was so cool.

└ It felt more like that because of the exhibition.

└ Yeah. It really felt like I had come back from space...

- I think he’s an irreplaceable artist.

└ So, where’s the next exhibition?

└ I need to see <Black Hole> again. The exhibition period is too short.

└ The fact that he's a college student is so cute. If he ever held a project exhibition at school, it would be incredible.

└ I need to go see it immediately. Multiple galleries must be desperate to invite him.

Seoyeon read the article and the comments on her phone. The scroll seemed endless.

“Wow, there are so many. You should check it out too.”

Kang Lim also read various articles, smiling contentedly. He enjoyed hearing people talk about their thoughts after seeing the exhibition.

He considered himself lucky to be born in this era. Sharing different thoughts expanded the meaning of the work.

Korean fans proudly shared the reactions of foreign media with others.

Domestic audiences who missed Kang Lim repeatedly visited the ongoing <Cyclic Spectrum> exhibition in Seoul Heum.

As the cumulative number of visitors increased, new inquiries poured in.

Those who couldn't see the <Black Hole> exhibition wanted at least the catalog.

In the end, Ryu Miyeon opened sales on the Heum website and organized an online photo exhibition.

The catalog and leaflets were all in a unique, vertically long format.

Since they featured a lot of backs, there was no need to make them wide.

‘It must have taken a lot of time to photograph every individual painting and the entire exhibition hall.’

The cover, made of black mirror paper, glittered.

In the center was a simple drawing of a back, with that part being matte paper.

Kang Lim looked at Seoyeon and spoke. He had received a lot of help in many ways.

“The catalog looks great. You worked hard on the preface and setting up with the planning team.”

“No problem, it’s my job. I showed the preface to Professor Shin Hansu, and he gave his approval.”

“Wow, that must feel satisfying.”

“Of course!”

As Seoyeon proudly shrugged her shoulders, Kang Lim handed her a box of chocolates.

“Whoa. What’s this? Isn’t this La Maison du Chocolat?”

“Yeah, it’s for you. It’s Valentine's Day in February.”

“Wow. I really like this! But, Valentine's Day is when girls give chocolates to guys, right? White Day is when guys give to girls.”

“...Really? But chocolate tastes better than candy.”

“Well, that’s true!”

Seoyeon laughed brightly and put a chocolate in her mouth.

The fresh cream and ganache softly enveloped her tongue, creating a unique flavor with a hint of wine.

Rachel, who was filming the making-of, captured John Ford and Lina Estelle on camera.

The two, who had just finished their individual interviews, naturally reminisced about the exhibition they saw yesterday.

John Ford, shaking his head as if it was unbelievable, spoke with an excited expression and sparkling blue eyes.

“Wow... I always knew Kang Lim was special, but he was even more amazing. It was completely different from what I saw on the set.”

“Perhaps it’s because personal projects allow him to fully unleash his creativity. Estelle, you were there too, right?”

At Rachel’s question, Estelle nodded fervently.

“Of course! I even viewed it when Director Frazer didn’t invite me. Starting from the Christie’s auction exhibition!”

“Do you generally like paintings?”

“Yes. Especially Kang Lim’s first solo exhibition touched me deeply. I also started acting at the age of six, and it was fascinating that the artist began drawing at the same age. Kang Lim probably felt a moment of destiny too. The feeling that this is his calling!”

Watching Estelle, John Ford added.

“He must have honed his skills over the years. How tough that time must have been. I feel that Kang Lim’s painting is similar to an actor’s performance.”

“In what way?”

“It allows you to experience someone else’s life. It makes you reflect on an individual’s life. The meticulous depiction of a person’s life is similar.”

Rachel smiled. The two main actors of the film were Hollywood’s finest.

Both had started acting as child actors and were legendary for their talents.

With careers already spanning 10 years, they had won top awards at the Golden Globes and Movie Awards, becoming some of the most beloved actors.

For such people to compare painting to acting was the highest praise.

“…For world-renowned actors like you two to show such expressions as fans of Kang Lim! If you promote the movie in Korea, it will be a huge deal. They will be proud.”

At Rachel’s words, Estelle burst into laughter.

“Haha. Will it only be Korea? When the movie is released, they might say we’re riding on his fame. It seems like the film will become an issue because Kang Lim, now a famous artist, participated in it during his unknown days.”

John Ford agreed with her.

“I don’t want to call Kang Lim just my double. In reality, actors and staff on set benefit a lot from him. As you’ve seen during the shoot, his script interpretation skills are outstanding.”

Rachel awkwardly looked around.

The staff, watching the interview, were nodding in agreement.

‘I can’t just make a film for the production report... Should I make one more for the DVD?’

The director of photography, the assistant director, and even the head director Frazer all liked Kang Lim.

Given that it was an art film, Rachel decided to make another documentary focusing on art production.

* * *

The art team staff also gathered on set to talk about Kang Lim. They were chattering like sparrows.

“Wow. At first, I just thought a skilled technician had come?”

“What technician, man.”

“Ah, listen to the end! The moment I saw live painting on set, I realized I was wrong! But then it gets shattered again?”

“Right. He’s just a genius! I wondered if the artist I had only heard about was like this.”

Little shrank among his colleagues.

He recalled the words he had said in front of Kang Lim when he went to R.F's solo exhibition.

[Kang Lim, isn’t being an artist your real job? When will you become like R.F? Be careful not to end up just as a staff member.]

Little pulled at his hair. He wanted to hide in a hole.

[Isn’t he making the movie just to get famous? Kang Lim, I’m worried you’ll be overshadowed by R.F.]

Hearing his own sarcastic voice echoing in his ears, his face turned red.

To make matters worse, he saw Kang Lim walking towards them.

Was that an illusion? Little edged sideways, speaking.

“Guys... I think I have a bit of a fever, so I’m going to head out early.”

“Huh, suddenly?”

As his colleagues tilted their heads, Little was already far away.

He stumbled awkwardly as he ran.

Seeing Little avoiding the scene, Kang Lim thought he might be a bit embarrassed and walked slowly.

Of course, it didn’t help much as the staff gathered around him all at once.

“Kang Lim, congratulations! The exhibition was amazing.”

“We were shocked to find out you were R.F! Little must be so embarrassed.”

“Yeah. He’s not feverish, maybe just sick with jealousy?”

“Puhaha.”

People laughed, holding their stomachs, and asked Kang Lim questions.

“But why are you here today? There’s no filming today.”

“Oh, a friend wanted to look around the set. I got permission from Director Charlotte, so I came.”

“Oh! Then enjoy to your heart’s content. Since we have to dismantle the set after filming, it’s best to enjoy it while it’s here. It’s a bit of a waste.”

“Right. And I don’t think I’ll be able to come here often anymore. I wanted to help out even when there’s no filming.”

As Kang Lim made a slightly apologetic face, Mary asked curiously.

“Why? Is something up? I mean, we’ll manage our work, of course!”

“Ah... I think I’ll be a bit busy. I’m starting a new semester as an exchange student at Beaux-Arts.”

“What! The Beaux-Arts in Paris? That’s such a hard place to get into!”

“Yes, that’s how it turned out.”

“Well, thinking about it, they must have really wanted to have you.”

“Haha. Not really. And I received another new offer, so I think I’ll be even busier.”

“Wow, are you having another exhibition?”

As Mary’s eyes sparkled, Kang Lim looked down at his phone.

It was a message from Ryu Miyeon, urging him to keep his schedule open for an important guest the next day.
