## Episode 90: Question

Kang Lim walked past the cafe street in Mangwon-dong and entered a secluded residential area.

Among them was a commercial building without a sign. If you go down below the laundry on the first floor, you'll find a hidden underground practice room.

Unlike the musty-smelling stairs, the inside is a relatively clean practice room.

Electric guitars and basses standing side by side, drums and keyboards occupying a wide area.

Although not a single ray of sunlight comes in, everything sparkled in Kang Lim's eyes.

“Ha ha, even if the soundproofing isn't perfect, since this place is a basement, we can practice as long as it's not too late at night. Jinseong hyung found this place for us.”

Sung Woojin spoke with an embarrassed expression.

In just a few months, Kang Lim had become so famous that it felt somehow awkward.

He hadn't even washed for days, focusing on the album work... Everything was on his mind. Embarrassed...

“I feel like we should treat you better, but I’m sorry it’s such a shabby place.”

Unlike Sung Woojin, who was concerned about various things, Kang Lim wandered around the practice room with an excited expression.

“Wow! This is so hip!”

“……”

“Jinseong hyung is definitely a leader.”

Kang Lim gave a thumbs-up to Heo Jinseong.

He is the versatile leader who handles composing, lead guitar, and sub-vocals in the Atomix band.

Until Sung Woojin joined, he also worked as the vocalist, so his singing skills are considerable.

The member Kang Lim liked the most after Sung Woojin in his previous life.

“Huh? How did you know I was the leader……?”

Heo Jinseong said with a slightly flustered expression.

He seemed a bit nervous since it was the first time someone other than the band members had come to this space.

“Ha ha! You’re the oldest. You found this practice room, and you just look like a reliable supporter.”

“Well… it’s nothing, but thank you.”

“Oh, please speak casually! I'm much younger.”

“Well, that’s true.”

Heo Jinseong momentarily avoided Kang Lim’s gaze.

Eyes soaked in happiness, a smile that was bright enough to look foolish...

Such an expression is typical of a die-hard fan, but it felt somewhat peculiar.

He hadn’t even heard their performance yet...

“Ahem, let me introduce our members. I’ll exclude Woojin since you already know him.”

“Yes, yes!”

Heo Jinseong pointed to two men.

One was slim, and the other was chubby.

Although their body shapes were different, both had bobbed hair and similar faces.

“Hello! I’m Lee Sodam, the bassist. I’m 22 years old.”

“I’m Park Youngsoo, the drummer! I’m 21 years old.”

“Hello, I’m Kang Lim. Nice to meet you.”

Kang Lim greeted the Atomix members.

Just shaking hands made his heart swell, and his eyes felt prickly for some reason.

It felt like he was becoming another member of a band that would become legendary.

Of course, the members’ expressions weren't much different from Kang Lim’s.

To them, Kang Lim was like an idol. A star who had escaped the tough days of being unknown.

It was like a dream that someone like him would design the cover for their first album.

“Hyung, thank you so much! We don’t have 220 million won, but we’ll treat you like the best in the industry.”

“Right. We’ve gathered 3 million won!”

Usually, a single album cover design fetches 2 million won.

If it involves working on the inside with many tracks, it’s 3 million won.

So, 3 million won for a single illustration was a good deal.

“No need to give me that much.”

“No, we must! Honestly, it’s hard to even bring someone like you here! And you’re leaving soon, right?”

“Well, then, I’ll gratefully accept.”

In fact, Kang Lim didn’t want to accept because of his fan spirit. He even felt like paying to design the album cover.

But it didn’t seem polite to refuse too much.

He also knew Heo Jinseong’s prideful personality.

“Woohoo! This album is going to be a hit!”

“Debut! Debut!”

The Atomix members jumped and rejoiced.

They ran and hugged Sung Woojin.

This guy is like a lucky charm. He sings well and even has superstar connections.

“What are you doing? Let’s start.”

Even Heo Jinseong, known for his cold image, couldn’t help but smile.

He tried to suppress his joy and barely managed to hold back his laughter.

“Right! You need to hear our song to get artistic inspiration. Hyung, please sit here.”

Kang Lim sat on the chair prepared by Sung Woojin.

Even if the chair fell backward and his head broke, he would feel happy.

Who would have thought a celebrity would play music just for him?

‘Atomix is an unknown rookie band now. It’s cute to see them in this phase. I wonder what song I’ll be designing the cover for...’

After setting up on the small stage, the members nodded to each other.

The small lights installed to save electricity only heightened the atmosphere.

Sung Woojin grabbed the microphone under the flickering lights.

On the dry and lonely stage...

Like a crackling bonfire, the small drum sounds resonated.

Then, a deep and rich guitar melody joined in.

It was a sound with plenty of delay and reverb effects.

The sounds, not overwhelming, repeated a simple chord.

A harmonious sense of space, the timbre of the electric guitar was unique.

[Because of the reason you came to hate her, many people will love her.]

A whispering low voice that tickles.

It matches well with the dreamy and hazy melody.

‘Question.’

How could he not know this song?

Kang Lim slowly closed his eyes.

This is Sung Woojin’s first self-composed song.

[Asking questions about her only brings agony.]

A peculiar music that is neither manic metal, pop, nor Korean pop...

This song is the starting point that brought an underground band to the mainstream.

Atomix swept all music shows and charts with this song for 10 weeks.

* * *

After the performance ended, the members simultaneously looked at Kang Lim.

They were clearly worried since it was a song they had never revealed to the public.

Their eyes seemed to ask if it was okay.

Kang Lim stood up and clapped as if he was moved.

“It’s the best. This will definitely be a success.”

Finally, the members, who had been frozen, started hitting each other’s backs.

They pulled at their worn-out T-shirts and burst into laughter.

“Especially the sound that gets crushed during the climax chorus. It feels like a scream.”

The chord progression and song atmosphere were exactly as Kang Lim remembered.

But the lyrics had changed a bit. They seemed deeper than before.

Kang Lim asked, looking at Sung Woojin.

“Who wrote the lyrics?”

“Ha ha, you ask me as if you already know it’s me.”

“Wow, you wrote it? That’s amazing.”

“It wasn’t the original lyrics, but I changed them after seeing your exhibition. I was shocked after seeing your debut solo exhibition.”

“Oh, really?”

“Yes, [We live in the present but yearn for the past. We love and hate at the same time. Why do people try to sever states like cutting with a knife? Many relationships can’t mix completely and can’t be distinguished.] That part.”

To think he influenced Sung Woojin... Kang Lim’s lips curled up.

Famous artists invite close singers to perform at their exhibition openings... that day doesn’t seem far off.

“This is the title track, right? I’ll design the album cover based on this.”

“Yes, that’s right.”

The Atomix members ruffled Sung Woojin’s hair as they spoke.

“That rascal Woojin is quite a genius. He learned guitar only half a year ago, but did you see him play earlier?”

“Hey, it’s a song with only a few chords. What’s the big deal?”

“Do you think it’s all about finger speed with the electric guitar? It’s about what sound you can produce.”

“Hmm...”

Kang Lim chuckled as he looked at Sung Woojin.

Although still shy, it was clear he was the beloved youngest member in the group.

Even Heo Jinseong sided with Sung Woojin.

“Actually, I didn’t want to write love songs. There are too many cheesy love songs in Korea. But after hearing Woojin’s melody line and lyrics, I changed my mind. Ah, this doesn’t have to be cliché.”

Kang Lim nodded vigorously.

Indeed, this song had garnered a lot of love by forming a deep connection.

Who could disregard teenage love after hearing this song?

“Right. It’s not just any song. It will resonate with anyone who has experienced a breakup. It’s perfect for the cold winter.”

The members burst into laughter at Kang Lim’s words.

“Ha ha. Let’s sit down and discuss the album concept!”

“Right. Have some cake too. It’s too big for me to eat alone.”

As Kang Lim opened the cake he received as a gift, the members rushed over.

Their eyes were sparkling. They seemed very hungry.

* * *

“Then, Kang Lim, if you just draw, will your works continue to sell for hundreds of millions?”

“Are you not fazed by being on the search rankings now?”

“How many hours a day do you draw? Is it a natural talent?”

The cake disappeared in no time, and the members, with cream smeared everywhere, bombarded him with questions.

Kang Lim didn’t know where to start answering, feeling dizzy.

Taking selfies together was nice, but it was overwhelming with cameras pointed at him from both sides.

“The price of a painting varies depending on its historical significance in art... It also varies with size. Even Picasso’s paintings range from tens of millions to billions. And being exposed to the media, I’m still not used to it. I draw every day.”

“Wow, that’s awesome. Then will you be able to draw a painting worth billions someday?”

Well, it might be possible if he leaves behind multiple masterpieces and decades pass after his death.

Kang Lim just shrugged in response.

It was a hard question to answer.

“Hey! Stop yapping, you guys. It’s so noisy.”

At Heo Jinseong’s words, the noisy members quieted down.

It only took a raised voice for silence to fall; a leader is indeed a leader.

Kang Lim was also relieved to stop the personal interview.

What mattered was the context and meaning behind this song.

“Firstly, I want to ask Woojin why he wrote this song. The album cover should accurately reflect the theme of the title track.”

At Kang Lim’s words, Sung Woojin responded.

He looked embarrassed to talk about himself.

“Um... honestly, it’s a childish story about breaking up with my girlfriend. But I want it to feel like a lingering trace or deep resonance rather than something trivial.”

“Trace?”

“Yes, after love ends, you look back and mature through the pain. I want it to feel precious despite the resentment and hatred.”

“Oh, I get it. The melody also felt like that, complex emotions.”

“Yes, exactly!”

“Send me the full lyrics by text.”

“Okay!”

Kang Lim looked at the members and asked.

“Does anyone have suggestions on what feeling it should convey?”

“Well, I’ll be happy with the artist’s touch.”

“I like everything Kang Lim does.”

“Hmm... I want to incorporate the band’s opinions into the design to some extent.”

After some thought, Heo Jinseong spoke.

“Since it’s our first album, I want it to clearly show the band’s identity.”

“Then, can you tell me why the band’s name is Atomix?”

Kang Lim asked out of formality. He already knew from reading their magazine interview.

‘Atomix’ meant a mix of various genres, spreading a shockwave like an atom bomb in the pop music scene.

“Um... Actually, there’s no special meaning. Woojin read a children’s book named Atomix, and we liked the sound of it.”

“What?”

Sung Woojin protested.

“Aw, hyung! It’s not a children’s book. It’s a young adult novel.”

“Same thing.”

“……”

The members laughed and handed over the book Woojin was reading.

The cover showed a kid hero, resembling Superman, flying in the sky.

Atomix was the protagonist’s name.

“A hero has appeared in the pop scene!”

“Creating shocking and new music!”

“Yes, a band with that image would be nice.”

Kang Lim chuckled, accepting Atomix’s identity.

Well, it’s similar enough to the magazine interview.

“Great. I’ll come up with a design reflecting everyone’s opinions.”

Clear eyes, a voice full of confidence.

The members cheered at the sight of a confident Kang Lim.
