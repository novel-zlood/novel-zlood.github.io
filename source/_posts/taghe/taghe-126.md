## Episode 126: Progress

Kang Lim entered the street of Saint-Germain, which is known for its many flower shops.

"Even though it's not yet March, the flowers have already bloomed…"

The tulips, boasting lovely colors, had already begun the spring season early.

After walking a bit further, he entered the École des Beaux-Arts.

The solid iron gates were wide open to welcome new students.

The only national art school in France. It's a place where the 19th-century genius painters, whom Kang Lim had filmed, exerted tremendous effort to get admitted.

Now, it was amazing to think that he could just walk here because it was close to his residency.

'Wow… The building isn't tall, but it's really spacious.'

Kang Lim looked up at the massive stone building.

The temple-like pillars, the arched windows reminiscent of a chapel, and the statues intricately carved into the walls were all impressive.

The school, boasting a 350-year history, was indeed classical.

'I should go inside quickly.'

He entered the educational building to escape the chilly wind.

His fluttering hair settled down calmly as if nothing had happened.

The interior of the building was also decorative. They say Louis XIV gathered graduates from here to decorate the Palace of Versailles…

Perhaps the architect who built this place had foreseen that.

The hall, adorned with elaborate tile patterns, was filled with students.

Just like the various pieces of colored tiles, people from diverse countries had gathered.

They were chatting while holding the same magazine, but they quieted down when Kang Lim appeared.

"Oh my, isn't that him?"

"…It is! They say he's here as an exchange student in the second year."

"I thought we rarely accepted transfer students? I thought exchange students were just nominal, but this is surprising."

"He must be really good to be selected! He's a total pro."

Feeling awkward due to the attention, Kang Lim approached the art wall displayed near the entrance.

Various magazines were arranged for students to freely take out and read.

'Is this why they were whispering?'

He figured out the reason for their murmuring.

Apparently, there's a place that Ryu Miyeon allowed to use her article photos, and it was Prestige again.

Kang Lim felt a bit embarrassed seeing his face prominently displayed in the dark.

He wasn't a wanted criminal, but his face was plastered all over the art wall, making him feel quite awkward.

'Was this taken during the talk with the artist?'

Kang Lim opened the magazine and read the part where the critique was printed.

It was the last thing Shin Hansoo left before leaving for Korea.

[In an era where innovative art fused with cutting-edge technology, led by media art, is emerging, painting is considered the oldest form of art with a prevalent perception of being outdated and limited. This is why Kang Lim's work mechanism is special. He has only showcased painting works in his three solo exhibitions. As I summarize Kang Lim's three solo exhibitions, I want to talk about the 'freedom of painting' he has gifted. While it's good to discuss the meaning of the works and the artist's deep contemplation, it's crucial to point out Kang Lim's 'breakdown of form.' I have observed him since his first solo exhibition in Korea. The first exhibition held in Paris was <24 Seasons of Emotions>. At that time, seeing the unique canvas Kang Lim had transformed, I instinctively felt that this artist might break away from the fixed frame of painting. The subsequent <Cyclic Spectrum> turned that instinct into certainty. The work, in which over 1,000 pieces constantly changed positions, was like a painting that transformed like music. The painting that expanded over thousands of meters might have been a prelude to the near-infinite <Black Hole>. Additionally, in the performance where he created a gigantic landscape using a human face, Kang Lim communicated with the audience. The most important characteristic of his work is that it includes the audience. This is also true for his third solo exhibition, <Black Hole>. Typically, when audiences visit a museum, they have to view the paintings from a distance, and if there's a frame, the distance from the work becomes even greater. However, Kang Lim's <Black Hole> embraces the audience. The work, which exists only when it breathes with the audience, provides liberation to the paintings that were quietly hanging on the wall. Kang Lim possesses an unstructured flexibility. His exhibitions are filled with heightened emotions and offer a synesthetic experience. The works, mixed with various times and perspectives, provide an illusion that the audience has never experienced before…]

"Are you just now reading this? I read it all as soon as it came out."

Seoyeon's voice interrupted him as he was reading the book.

"Thanks to that critique, there are people who say they'll go see the exhibition in Korea? Your public art project from before is also up on this site."

Kang Lim closed the magazine and smiled brightly.

He was already feeling the intense stares from people, so it was a relief to meet someone he knew.

"That's great news. By the way, when did you get here? You have French class today too, right?"

"Yeah! This is the only class we can take together."

"Right. Taemin will be here soon too. He texted me yesterday saying he's taking this class."

"It's been a while."

"Oh, right. And…"

Kang Lim rummaged through his coat pocket as if he remembered something.

He took out a colorful paper bag and handed it to Seoyeon.

"Oh? What's this? An entrance gift?"

"Yes. Director Charlotte gave it to me. It's a photo we took before."

"Wow. It's already out?"

Seoyeon, who liked analog film, was thrilled at the thought of having a good memory.

Moreover, when she opened the bag, there was a pendant emitting a subtle bronze glow.

"Wow! Amazing. They put a photo in the pendant."

"Yes, it's a necklace. They were going to use it as a prop but it was too old, so they couldn't use it. They said they're glad they found a use for it."

"It's so pretty. I love things like this."

Seoyeon polished the pendant with her sleeve and opened the lid.

Her heart raced with excitement at the special gift.

"……."

However, the photo she expected wasn't there.

Seoyeon's fantasy was shattered in an instant.

The focus in her eyes, which had been shining with anticipation, gradually faded.

Her face came out pitch black, and Kang Lim's eyes were half-closed.

"Look at this. Why is your expression so stiff?"

Kang Lim tapped the photo of Seoyeon and burst into laughter.

How red must her face have been for her skin to come out that dark.

Thanks to that, her wide-open eyes stood out.

"This is truly a bizarre photo that could only be salvaged in black and white. I almost died laughing."

Seoyeon didn't respond to Kang Lim's words.

She quietly stared at the photo before closing the pendant lid.

Her tightly clenched hand trembled, and a cold voice flowed out.

"…Do you have this photo too?"

"Of course. I'll keep it forever."

"Give it to me!"

"Nope~."

"Don't look at it!"

The two of them quarreled as they entered the classroom.

The students watching from a distance were simply amazed.

They thought, "He's just like anyone else, playing around and joking. He really is twenty-one years old." That was the look in their eyes.

* * *

After his French class, Kang Lim had lunch at a nearby restaurant.

Seoyeon had to quickly finish her meal and leave because she had a history lecture.

Fine arts classes only had one or two classes a day, so they were leisurely, but it seemed different for her side.

"Phew… Isn't this school really crappy?"

Shin Taemin took out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it.

There were many smokers on the street, so it looked natural.

Every time he exhaled, a hazy smoke rose in front of Kang Lim's eyes.

Kang Lim, observing the smoke, replied with a bright expression.

"Since I stay at the residency, I wouldn't know. Coming here occasionally feels romantic and nice."

"…You're teasing."

Kang Lim nodded at Shin Taemin's words.

Come to think of it, the private dorm here costs 400 euros per month.

Given the rundown environment, it must be tough for Shin Taemin, who used to live in a nice house.

"Who told you to come to Paris? It’s always been dirty here."

"If only the house was old, it would be fine, but the roommate is filthy. Did you see the guy sitting in front earlier?"

"Oh… Baudoin?"

"Yeah. He doesn't wash."

Kang Lim recalled the particularly large Baudoin. His greasy curly hair was memorable.

His eyes were a clear and clean green, but it seemed he didn’t wash his body well.

"Can't you move to a larger private dorm? Doesn’t your father give you an allowance?"

"He used to let me spend freely, but lately he hasn't been giving much."

"Why?"

"I don't know. He got a bit weird after you left for Paris."

Shin Taemin frowned and tilted his head.

After thinking for a while, he spoke again.

"I'm supposed to send him the process of my artwork, drawings, essays, and analysis of art history writers every day, but suddenly he stopped checking?"

"Wow… Seriously? That's amazing that you did that all this time."

"It's weirder that he suddenly stopped. Doesn’t that feel odd?"

Kang Lim laughed at Shin Taemin's suspicious look.

They say if you suddenly release animals that have been caged for a long time, they continue to act as if the fence is still there… It seems he’s not used to it.

"Maybe he’s just giving you freedom."

"All of a sudden?"

"I don't know, man."

Judging by the reduction in his allowance, it seems like he’s given freedom but also neglected.

Indeed, everything has its pros and cons. Responsibility comes with it.

"Anyway, let’s go to the studio. For the next class."

"Yeah."

The two walked into the studio.

Interestingly, the Beaux-Arts studio is used by students from the first to the fifth year together.

There aren't many students, and they also mix classes.

Kang Lim unfolded a large drawing board at his assigned spot.

He took out a wrapped painting and hung it on the wall. It was a piece he and Seoyeon had bought at an auction before.

"Isn't this cool? I bought it for 3 million won. It came out in a blind auction, so I don’t know who the artist is, but I just liked it."

"……."

When no answer came, he turned around.

Shin Taemin was silently staring at the painting.

"You’re shocked too, huh? I felt the same way the first time I saw it. It's very sensory, right?"

Kang Lim slowly stepped back and stood next to Shin Taemin.

Looking at the painting again, he thought he had indeed made a good purchase.

A primitive man with limbs half-covered in hair.

It was a painting that captured the moment of sneezing while eating a live animal.

From the thick lips of the primitive man, pieces of flesh and bone mixed with snot and saliva flew out.

The desperate look in his eyes, as if being chased by something, was impressive.

"I really like that grotesque touch. When you sneeze, there's a strong recoil in your body, and it seems like the artist captured that momentary distortion."

"…Why did you buy this?"

"It has a powerful image! The expression is amazing. And the title of the work was <The World I Live In>. I think they see themselves as an indigenous person on an island."

Shin Taemin stood still for a moment and then brushed his hair back.

His neat forehead was revealed.

"I painted this. My mother knows an auctioneer, so she put it in. She told me to try it out when I was feeling down to see if anyone would want to own my painting."

"…What? This is your painting? The style is different."

Kang Lim moved closer to the painting.

He couldn’t believe it, but as he kept looking at the primitive man's face, he could vaguely see Shin Taemin’s features.

No, the eyes, nose, and mouth were definitely different… but the atmosphere of fearing something was similar.

The feeling of being chased by something rapidly approaching.

"I felt like I was always obsessing over my face, so I created an avatar to represent me. When I see your exhibitions, you seem to always break the mold, so I wondered what it would be like to break the mold of a self-portrait. Does a self-portrait always have to depict my face? I had such strange thoughts. Originally, I wouldn't even think of such nonsense, but your work makes me think of those things."

"Wow… Haha. This is unbelievable."

"I thought it could be more me without depicting my face. You know how people are more honest on anonymous sites because they can tell everything since no one knows them."

"Really, what a coincidence. No… You made me buy it. I genuinely thought it was good."

"Thanks. Actually, after it was sold, I worked really hard to develop a new style. I spent the whole winter vacation working on it."

Kang Lim alternated between looking at the painting and Shin Taemin. Slowly, a smile spread across his face.

While he was balancing between competitions and Heum's solo exhibition, this guy had been making tremendous progress too.

'In the original future, Shin Taemin becomes a promising painter domestically, but his work lacks depth. But at this rate…'

The future seemed likely to change.

Indeed, something significant was changing.

* * *

Classes at Beaux-Arts are conducted in a workshop format.

Since the professors are actual contemporary artists, the students choose subjects based on their work.

Kang Lim took various classes but liked Professor Alfonso's class the most.

His expressive art class was so free.

They would draw with their eyes closed or dance to music.

Alfonso said that only things artists experience with their whole body could expand their work.

It’s hard to express something one hasn’t felt.

Kang Lim gradually changed, sympathizing with his words.

He could understand the meaning of sound and movement on the canvas more delicately.

No wonder Nam June Paik majored in music.

The rules of music scattered into elements of points, lines, and planes.

Kang Lim even bought a microphone that could capture very subtle sounds.

He walked around, collecting the sounds of nature.

He didn’t know when he would use them, but they seemed like important materials.

The schedule at Beaux-Arts had a lot of free time, so he could go on trips to the outskirts of France.

When the flowers withered, and the buds started to sprout and grow lush...

When Kang Lim had gathered various sounds, Alfonso gave the students their first assignment.

"I've helped you directly feel the world. Now, show me what you've felt."

He presented two words.

[Time, Freedom]

It was very typical of Alfonso.

"Choose one of the two and create a work. Since you’ve felt enough, you can visualize abstract things that can't be expressed in words."

Kang Lim was holding a microphone amid the students.

While the murmuring sounds were being recorded, he nodded.

‘Life is time… Death is freedom, perhaps...’
