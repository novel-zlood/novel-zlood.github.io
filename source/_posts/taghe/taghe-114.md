## Episode 114: Butterfly Effect

Assistant Director Martin was monitoring the first shooting scene of John Ford and Kang Lim with the cinematographer.

The cinematographer shook his head in disbelief.

To think that he could produce a perfect cut without trembling in front of Hollywood's top actors, and in one take...

The young man's confidence was astounding. His vigor was so overwhelming that even the staff felt intimidated.

"Wow. It's amazing that Director Fraser is giving cuts this quickly. I'm personally surprised. Where did you find this artist?"

Martin smiled as he looked at the cinematographer's face.

He was someone who approached filming with a stricter attitude than anyone, reflecting his directorial intentions in every scene for the sake of beautiful imagery.

Not only Fraser but countless directors wanted to work with him. To receive praise from such a stubborn person, the first shoot was excellent.

'I still remember the suffocating silence on set.'

Martin brushed his arm.

The scene of Kang Lim putting his hand into his pupil and breaking a branch replayed in his mind.

At that moment, a tension that seemed about to shatter formed throughout the entire film.

"Honestly, I thought there would be a lot of NGs. Are you sure this is his first film?"

Martin burst into laughter seeing the cinematographer's serious expression. Deep wrinkles were etched on his forehead.

"Yes, that's right. Charlotte brought him properly. And thanks to the cinematographer's precise explanation of the movements, we got a good cut."

"Hah... and he did it in one go after hearing that?"

Following the count into the garden and observing him while sculpting his face... This involved quite a complicated movement.

Since there were rails laid on the garden lawn, it was easy for the actor to bump into the camera within them.

The cinematographer also came with a mindset of teaching the substitute for the first time today and had emptied his mind. But that expectation was shattered.

Martin spoke as if he had read the cinematographer's thoughts.

"It's fascinating to keep watching Kang Lim's acting scenes. Usually, when someone acts for the first time, they have difficulty staying within the camera's frame..."

"Exactly. That's why people say that capturing the limited range of the camera in film shooting is just a matter of experience and intuition."

Actors who lack filming experience or come from theater often make movements so large that their arms and legs get cut off from the screen.

This results in NG cuts that directors who value perfect screen composition hate the most.

"Yet his actions aren't restrained, and he navigates precise movements while staying within the frame."

"That's right. Thanks to that, we won't have to cut and edit some scenes. Connecting them in one go preserves the on-set feel and makes it better."

The cinematographer silently nodded at Martin's words.

With a flushed face, he twitched his lips and brought up two screens.

"Actually, I got goosebumps while monitoring!"

"What is it?"

"This... you'll understand only by comparing two scenes together. The cuts with John Ford and Kang Lim. Even if you say he has a good sense, this is really strange."

With a gaze that seemed unfocused, the cinematographer took a deep breath and played the two screens.

"Watch closely. John Ford comes out and sculpts the count's head, right? From the neatly combed bangs to the sideburns... Then, he slowly shapes the nose, lips, and facial contours."

John Ford also learned sculpting for several months to perform this role.

He couldn't make the face exactly like the count's, but he had decent skills to direct the screen. If ordinary people watched, they would have applauded John Ford's ability.

However, what shocked Martin wasn't John Ford's sculpting skill. His eyes were on Kang Lim, who was playing John Ford. Martin's face grew paler as the screen progressed.

"...What is this? Is this even possible?"

"Yes. I was shocked too. The speed and sequence of actions of both actors match perfectly. Kang Lim is replicating John Ford's performance exactly. The editing director could randomly cut and paste, and it would still connect seamlessly."

The cinematographer repeatedly paused and played the screen.

Kang Lim synchronized all his actions and gestures frame by frame.

It wasn't a memory that a human could replicate.

A few days later, Kang Lim moved for the next shoot.

In the car, he reviewed the scene he would act today.

[After showcasing excellent sculpting skills, protagonist Christian works as a gardener.

Since he handled all his meals and lodging at the count's castle, he could gather funds solely for investing in paintings...]

Christian bought paintings as people do with financial investments.

He strategized by dividing paintings that could yield short-term profits and those for long-term investment.

'New painting styles are bound to face opposition. If I went back to the 19th century, I would have bought them like this.'

Kang Lim nodded as he read the script.

The representative works of Pissarro and Renoir, which Christian purchases early on, could yield significant short-term profits.

This was because they didn't just paint natural landscapes preferred by the Impressionists.

'Landscapes weren't popular at that time. It was hard to make money by buying them immediately.'

It was an era where educational paintings representing the authority of France symbolized art.

Since historical hero epics or biblical content were the main subjects, Impressionism, which observed light falling on common landscapes, was disregarded. It was far from high art.

Of course, there wasn't zero demand for landscapes.

As a new middle class emerged, they bought paintings to hang in their homes.

'However, even the middle class preferred Barbizon School painters like Millet for landscapes.'

They preferred paintings that expressed light and shadow well and had clear outlines like photographs.

Impressionist landscapes painted with rapid brushstrokes on-site only seemed unfinished.

'So, the only decent painters for early investment are Pissarro and Renoir.'

Pissarro depicted the modern Paris where various social classes mingled and the city enriched by Baron Haussmann, earning quite favorable reviews from critics.

Renoir also painted portraits of capitalists, politicians, and vibrant bourgeois, so buying them in advance wasn't a huge loss.

'Monet's paintings are the best for long-term investment. He eventually gets recognized as the greatest painter in France during his lifetime. They become extremely expensive. Moreover, Impressionism enjoys a boom in American exhibitions more than in Europe. Going abroad quickly is also an option.'

Kang Lim chuckled at the protagonist planning American exhibitions.

Thinking about it, knowing the future gives one a huge advantage. Knowing where and how the value of money will skyrocket.

'But here's the problem. Thinking one can change someone's life... Is that arrogance?'

Christian is overly conscious of his rival Percy, who insulted him.

Since Percy had the same foresight as him, he wanted to secure good artists much earlier.

Moreover, Percy was the type who had to get the paintings he decided to own.

If he bought the desired painting first, he could resell it at a high price.

In the end, an anxious Christian decides to quickly build rapport with the artists.

This includes even the post-Impressionist painters who hadn't started painting yet or were amateurs.

He decided to hasten the time.

'So, what I have to act today is how the protagonist influenced a mere painter like Gauguin. That's it.'

Kang Lim fiddled with his hand covered in silicone.

It had been a while since he had switched to the hands of the actor playing Gauguin.

They were much rougher and darker in skin color than John Ford's hands.

'These hands feel rough and don't grip well.'

Just as he was thinking that, his phone vibrated.

[Seoyeon: Kang Lim, come to the planning office after today's shoot. Check the installation scene for the solo exhibition.]

[Kang Lim: Wow, already?]

Many people are busy here and there.

* * *

Upon arriving at the set, Kang Lim checked his surroundings and confirmed his movements. It was a place set up as Gauguin's atelier.

The room with its strikingly open red windows was filled with traces of experiments. The vibrant colors and touches of the props overflowed with lively energy.

Gauguin, who wasn't shy about promoting himself and boasted a wide network like a jack-of-all-trades. It was a spacious workshop reflecting his generous personality.

'Early on, Gauguin worked as a stockbroker, so he had quite a bit of wealth. When he started painting, he was excited rather than worried about the poverty to come.'

Gauguin actively participated in art transactions, earning a lot of money.

He appears as someone who trusted his own judgment and had pride.

In a positive light, he was confident; in a negative light, he was a naive character.

"Hahaha! Nice to meet you! I'll just be doodling, but Kang Lim, you'll do well, right? I heard the first shoot was amazing! I've heard all the rumors!"

The actor playing Gauguin approached Kang Lim with a handshake, spitting as he spoke.

"Thank you. I'll do my best."

Kang Lim greeted him warmly and observed his face.

How could someone have such frog-like deep eyes and an aquiline nose without makeup... It was a perfect casting from appearance to personality.

"Alright, Kang Lim, we'll start shooting now."

After the actor's performance, Kang Lim entered the frame.

Assistant Director Martin looked at Fraser's face among the staff.

He had a similarly expectant expression as Martin.

'Does he really memorize the actors' performances? If it's not a coincidence, we can confirm it again.'

Martin approached the video village where Fraser was. He wanted to see Kang Lim's acting up close.

'Especially this scene is challenging. It's not free creation; there are conditions, so it might be more difficult.'

The amateur painter Gauguin encounters various images through the protagonist.

He is deeply shocked by the sight of Tahiti, which he would come to love, and Japanese prints, Ukiyo-e.

A person's life can change significantly depending on who they meet.

Similarly, painters are strongly influenced by the images they see.

In short, this scene had to show the butterfly effect caused by the protagonist.

It hinted at how a painter's life could drastically change.

'Especially, I'm curious how he'll incorporate Ukiyo-e into oil painting.'

The West draws things as they appear. Hence, light appears, and precise perspective is maintained.

Conversely, the East does not draw things as they appear.

They believe that doing so distances them from the essence of objects.

A painting with no precise perspective and hardly any shadows... To contemporary painters, Eastern prints were revolutionary.

The mere act of drawing flatly was shocking.

'But it wouldn't make sense to grasp it all at once and create a masterpiece just by looking at Ukiyo-e. I need to subtly reveal Gauguin's latent wild image.'

A painting mixed with Eastern and Western styles. How will he portray the early works showing the signs of a master?

With an intrigued smile, Martin watched Kang Lim.

"Scene 58. Gauguin's Atelier-!"

The moment the slate clapped. Kang Lim picked up the brush.

Like a painter encountering a new world, his eyes were filled with joy.
