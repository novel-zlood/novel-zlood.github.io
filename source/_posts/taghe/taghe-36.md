## Episode 36: Summer Festival

Lee Hyerim’s mouth slowly opened as she saw Seoyeon.

Great proportions, great skin… and her features were beyond words.

‘This is the first time I’ve seen someone so pure. Is she Kang Lim’s girlfriend?’

Kang Lim smiled as he spoke to the curious-looking Lee Hyerim.

“Oh, noona, you should go rest like Yoonki hyung. It’ll be done once you just pour in that trash. I’ll handle the rest from here.”

“Oh… okay! I’ll come back later to see the finished product.”

“Sure. Go ahead. Good job.”

As soon as Kang Lim greeted Lee Hyerim, he ran over to Seoyeon.

Lee Hyerim realized she didn’t matter at all and slowly walked away.

Seoyeon was looking around at the newly installed canopy.

Kang Lim walked around the canopy, following Seoyeon, and said,

“Why did you come early? I told you to take your time. It’s not even finished yet.”

“I thought so, so I came early to help if there was anything I could do. You said today was the final installation day.”

“Wow… can I cry? I’m touched.”

“Haha. Why are you crying over that?”

Seoyeon was also a reliable supporter of Kang Lim.

Thinking about it, since entering school, he had gained a lot of people who helped him, and he felt proud.

“Isn’t it cheating for something unfinished to be this pretty? You’re not even Schubert.”

“You make such classy jokes.”

“…what are you talking about?”

Seoyeon placed her hand on the canopy and smiled, then ran towards the stairs Kang Lim had designed.

“This one’s finished, right?”

“Yeah, it’s all done.”

“It’s really clean and pretty. You used synthetic wood… it even has wood grain?”

“There are various types of synthetic wood, and the guy gave me the expensive kind.”

“No wonder it looks natural and high-quality. It makes you want to sit down.”

Seoyeon sat on a chair and placed her camera and tripod down.

“The canopy design is so unique. From a distance, it looks like a jellyfish. Did you do this all by yourself?”

“Of course.”

“Wow~ seeing how you made displays for cosmetics, it seems you’re also good with computers.”

“You’re flattering me too much. I already feel like flying.”

“That’s surprising. I thought you’d just take compliments for granted with your confidence.”

“Haha.”

Kang Lim laughed at Seoyeon, who was playfully glaring at him.

“Then, please help me with this now.”

“With what?”

“We need to fill the transparent canopy with trash and close the lid.”

“Trash?”

With a curious expression, Seoyeon walked over to Kang Lim.

“I’ll climb the ladder. Pass me the two bags tied with red strings from the left.”

“Gosh, they look heavy.”

“They’re recycling trash, so they’re light.”

“Ah, okay.”

Kang Lim securely fixed the ladder and climbed up.

“Give it to me now.”

“Okay.”

Seoyeon grabbed the bottom of the sack and handed it up.

‘Even though I tinted it, I didn’t do it strongly with black, so the bottom needs to be blocked with flat, densely compressed cans.’

Kang Lim opened the red sack Seoyeon handed up and piled the colored cans neatly on the first layer.

The canopy below cast a much darker shadow, making it cooler.

“Yeon-ah, pass me the bag tied with the blue string.”

“Okay.”

The next sack was filled with translucent colored plastic.

Kang Lim arranged the less compressed plastic trash haphazardly.

The colors of the cans below combined with this, giving it a more mysterious feel.

“We’ve filled the roof… just need to fill the pillars.”

“Right, there’s one bag left.”

Kang Lim emptied the last sack into the center pillar hole.

Rattle.

The empty pillar was filled with brightly colored vivid trash.

The last sack was plastic that hadn’t been altered or compressed, keeping its original form.

Plastic spoons, small cup lids, and such.

“Wow, it’s really pretty. It looks like one of those machines that dispense beads.”

“Does it look okay? I painted everything green to give a forest feel.”

“It’s more than okay. Is this just green? You have a good sense of color.”

Seoyeon’s eyes sparkled as she looked at the filled canopy.

The green hues were varied.

Lime, olive, watermelon, emerald, mugwort, melon, bamboo…

Various colors were harmoniously arranged.

Mixing and intertwining, sometimes appearing as dark teal, sometimes as khaki.

“Great, perfect. Why does it seem to sparkle?”

“I applied some silver gilding wax.”

“The kind used in elementary school crafts?”

“Yeah, that’s right.”

“Wow. Applying it sparingly makes it look pretty.”

“To keep within the budget, I used paint instead of proper colors.”

“Wow, really? The colors are so varied I thought you used acrylics.”

“With just red, yellow, blue, white, and black, you can make most colors.”

Kang Lim closed and secured the canopy roof and climbed down the ladder.

Indeed, completing and installing the work felt most satisfying.

“Then, please take some photos.”

Seoyeon smiled at Kang Lim.

“Just wait!”

“Why? What now?”

“Who am I?”

“Seoyeon.”

“A photographer…”

“Ah, got it. So we need to wait.”

“Of course.”

“Well… my work looks best in bright sunlight. It’s a bit cloudy now.”

“What are you talking about?”

“You’ll see in a bit.”

This guy’s work always had something new to reveal.

Seoyeon looked at Kang Lim with interest.

He was like an onion.

“Oh… the person I asked for is coming.”

“Who?”

“Someone who can be photographed.”

Seoyeon turned her head following Kang Lim’s gaze.

In the distance, Seong Woojin was coming with an amp speaker.

* * *

As Seong Woojin sang a few songs, people started gathering.

If there used to be around thirty people, now it was like a mini-concert.

Including people sitting on the stairs and standing next to them.

“Wow… what’s that? The place where the singer is standing.”

“I think it’s a sculpture project by the city?”

“Oh. Cool. I didn’t know the city did things like this.”

Seoyeon and Kang Lim were watching people’s reactions from behind the tripod.

Seoyeon adjusted the camera and said,

“Anyway… your works are so big that I need a wide-angle lens. Just like the first assignment.”

“You’re trying to include all the people, right?”

“Of course. This work includes interacting with people. I’ll take detailed shots separately later.”

Kang Lim was pleased that Seoyeon understood the intention of his work.

He was quietly glad that he had executed his project well.

Seong Woojin also opened his mouth with a satisfied expression.

“It’s the first time so many people have gathered to watch. It must be thanks to the new stage.”

“Wow!”

“Amazing!”

“The next song suits this tree I’m standing next to.”

Seong Woojin smiled as he pointed to the canopy made by Kang Lim.

* * *

After a brief silence,

simple guitar chords started coming from the speaker.

Just the intro of the song made hearts flutter. It was a song by that band.

‘Wow. This song choice is unfair.’

Kang Lim looked around.

People who knew the band were already buzzing.

Seong Woojin smiled lightly and started singing.

- I am free to choose whatever I want.

As soon as he sang one line,

the gentle guitar sound was pierced by the refreshing string sound of the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

- If I want, I can sing the blues.

Then again on top of that,

a thrilling electronic guitar sound spread.

- I am free to say whatever I want.

Seong Woojin sang in a completely different style from before.

People flinched at his slightly husky voice scratching at their throats.

A tingling sensation like an electric shock.

A sound that shook the entire body made the heartbeat feel stronger.

Even without any high notes, he comfortably dominated the stage with just his tone.

Naturally…

people’s eyes turned to Seong Woojin.

The canopy made by Kang Lim made Seong Woojin, who had his eyes half-open, stand out.

People swallowed nervously as they watched him holding the mic and swaying as if immersed in the moment.

The materials in the transparent acrylic box were no longer trash.

As Seong Woojin said, they were the tree itself.

The mysterious colors swayed like a forest moving.

Round notes and colors shook people’s hearts simultaneously.

- You can feel joy anywhere

The orchestra accompaniment intensifies.

In response, the electronic sound also immediately raises its pitch.

- If you want, you can shout out loud!

Is the sky helping this stage?

At the same time, the clouds cleared, and the bright sunlight emerged.

“Wow…”

It was like an oasis unfolding in the middle of the desert.

People’s mouths opened, and their faces turned rosy.

The thin groove at the end of the canopy roof that Kang Lim had dug started letting in light.

‘Excluding the singer in the center, the warm sunlight is drawing an angel ring in the distant outskirts…’

Seoyeon was surprised but quickly pressed the shutter.

She didn’t want to miss this moment.

The stunning visual effect made even those sitting in chairs slightly stand up.

The canopy designed by Kang Lim changed color as more light came in.

‘The transparent acrylic box roof only lets sunlight in from the top, creating a skylight effect.’

Why did looking at this sculpture remind her of Claude Monet’s water lilies?

Kang Lim’s work changed as it caught the ever-changing light.

It sparkled.

Sometimes like new buds blooming in spring.

Sometimes like leaves swaying in early summer.

It made one feel the cool natural breeze completely.

“Mom was right. It does cool you down if you stay still.”

People’s humorous reactions to the visual air conditioning effect increased.

Seoyeon pressed the shutter from various angles, capturing every moment.

Not only Seoyeon but also people with smartphones increased.

“Wow… was there such a vocalist?”

“But what’s with that parasol? It’s so cool.”

“Hyung, I think we should bring him in as our main vocalist. He’s cute and handsome.”

Hearing a somewhat familiar voice, Kang Lim turned around.

‘Wow… this legendary meeting starts here.’

They were the people who would form a band with Seong Woojin.

Knowing how famous they would become, Kang Lim excitedly tapped Seoyeon.

“Those people. They’ll become legends. Seriously.”

“…Who are they?”

“They do band music and will hit number one on the Billboard.”

“What Korean band hits number one on the Billboard? That’s a big dream.”

“No, it’s true. I have a bit of a knack for seeing the future.”

“You said that last time too…”

Seoyeon looked skeptical and made a prim expression.

Then she spoke softly to Kang Lim.

“Can I make a prophecy too? I can see the future.”

“What is it?”

“You’ll become a legend too.”

The song was heading towards its climax.

- Whatever you do

The fantastic meeting of electric guitar and orchestra.

- Whatever you say

The rockestra and Seong Woojin’s voice were reaching their peak.

- I know it’s right

The audience who knew the song cheered and sang along to the chorus.

Kang Lim, with a puzzled expression, asked,

“What?”

Seoyeon closed her eyes and shouted.

In front of this sound and voice that seemed to control the stage, she thought no one would hear her.

“You’ll become a legend too, you idiot!”

Bursting into laughter at Seoyeon’s answer, Kang Lim kept laughing and said,

“It’s better hearing it twice.”

“…”

* * *

After Seong Woojin finished singing,

Oasis’s “Whatever” repeated its outro for over three minutes.

This song, over six minutes long, only had an instrumental part after 3 minutes and 33 seconds.

But that day,

no one found this song boring.

Until the ever-chattering tambourine quieted down,

they just regretted that the song was ending.
