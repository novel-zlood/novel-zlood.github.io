## 9. Never Underestimate South Korea Again! (1)

It's embarrassing.

Recently, people in Korea started calling me ‘Nellumjwa,’ because a broadcast camera caught me secretly sticking my tongue out at Fabrizio, who was trailing me the entire match against Ascoli and ended up getting sent off.

Well, having a nickname is nice.

Along with the nickname, I can feel the growing expectations and interest towards me.

My mother finally received a call from a distant relative asking to borrow money.

When she told me the news, my mother exclaimed, "You've finally become an overnight star!"

Anyway.

In the next match against Crotone, I played as the left winger again and scored multiple goals.

Thanks to that, I was awarded MVP once more.

It was already my fourth MVP award, making me the player leading Parma's charge to the top.

And then, I flew back to Korea.

I was called up for the national team again.

Honestly, I thought I wouldn't be called up after the last time... but it turns out that our coach Pedro really likes me.

I'm not sure if he saw me playing as a holding midfielder in the last match, but he put me in for the friendly against Syria and the final World Cup Asian qualifiers match against Iran.

Honestly, I didn't record any attacking points in either match, and since all the main players were playing, I might not have had a reason to be in the attacking midfield.

But some experts praised me a lot for carrying the ball well as a holding midfielder...

Well, I'm satisfied with that.

Moreover, I was pleased to be the hero of Korea's first-ever away victory against Iran with the A national team.

I didn't perform too badly myself.

But for sure, the organic movements of Sunbae-nim Shin Junseo and the other attacking midfielders were on another level.

-Shin Junseo! Shin Junseo GOOOOOAAL!

-Right at that moment, the match ends!

-Finally! Korea achieves its first victory against Iran in an away match!

Shin Junseo is definitely Shin Junseo.

There's a reason he's playing for Tottenham.

Seeing his dribbling and running skills, I honestly doubted whether he was even human.

Honestly, I couldn't talk much during training.

But after all the matches ended and before heading back to Italy, I got to have a light dinner with Sunbae.

He said he was really happy to hear that I was playing football again.

Of course... was it just lip service?

I took a picture with Sunbae, holding the Tottenham jersey he gave me, and we smiled brightly.

Two hours after the picture was posted on Shin Junseo's SNS, I received a chilling text from Monika.

-Monika: Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham?

There's something wrong with North London.

I'm sure there's some bad energy flow in London.

I'm convinced.

-Monika: Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone.

Or maybe there's some cosmic horror in the London sewers that drives people mad.

"Porco Dio!"

Monika is terrifying.

I hope Arsenal wins so Monika doesn't throw such fits.

Please...

Even though I kept up the good atmosphere, there wasn't much change in my life.

Although a few Korean journalists came to Parma and caused a bit of a nuisance.

Well, that wasn't a big problem.

Rather, Santiago.

It was evident that he had slacked off in training during the international match week.

"Like this! Do it like this."

"No, that's something only Mino can do."

This lazy guy grumbles again.

How is this difficult?

You catch the ball with a flick!

Turn your body swiftly!

Shoot with an out-front kick, and...

You complete the Quaresma special.

Is this hard?

"Yeah, it's damn hard."

But his eyes are filled with dissatisfaction.

You chose Quaresma.

Endure it with grit.

"Ah! I don't care! I'll just practice what I'm good at! I don't need this!"

In the end, he gave up and ran off somewhere to practice his dribbling enthusiastically again.

But seeing that, I couldn't help but be amazed at Santiago's talent.

How does he move like that?

And make such decisions?

I've heard that many clubs are interested in Parma lately.

I heard that scouts from several Serie A teams visited our stadium in the last match.

Their targets were me and Santiago.

Anyway.

Lately, I've been focusing on improving my out-front skills in training.

I've put a lot of effort into making my shots and crosses with both my right and left foot more fluid using the out-front technique.

Thanks to that, I've somewhat adapted with my left foot.

But honestly, my right foot still feels lacking.

"Mino! Shall we take a break?"

After running around like a dog.

Santiago comes up to me, suggesting to rest since it seems like a good time to slack off.

But we can't rest.

And I can't let this lazy guy rest either.

"Uh, we still have stamina training left."

"Oh..."

Lately, Santiago's concentration has been dropping in the latter part of the matches, often missing good passes during the final moments.

From what I feel, he's at a similar level to me in terms of stamina, which has improved through consistent stamina training.

Probably because of the mistake he made in the past when he gained weight up to 90kg during the off-season.

That's why I pushed him harder.

I also honed my free kicks and passes under the strict guidance of Sunbae-nim Shin Junseo during my high school days.

Thanks to that, I rotated between being a starter and a reserve in my senior year of high school.

"Alright! Fun stamina training time!"

"No, it's absolutely not fun."

The lazy guy grumbles with a sullen face.

But what else can he do?

Behind me stands Parma's legend.

Giovanni Buffon, glaring fiercely, made the lazy guy whimper and eventually stand beside me to start running together.

Kid.

I told you to do it right when you have to.

* * *

US Lecce.

A professional football team based in Lecce, Apulia, Italy, and our next opponent.

We have a strange bad connection with this team.

Well, it's their feelings towards us.

In the 2019-20 season.

Lecce, who were in Serie A, could have stayed in 17th place if they won the final match against Parma.

But they suffered a crushing defeat to Parma, finished 18th, and were relegated to Serie B.

Of course, Parma also spectacularly messed up the following season and got relegated...

Anyway.

Maybe that's why Lecce has bad feelings towards us.

Not to the level of a derby.

But enough to curse us occasionally when they think of us?

In such a situation, the match between us, the league leaders, and Lecce, the 5th place team, has become quite a hot topic in Serie B.

But I find the next match against Benevento, the 2nd place team, more interesting.

Well... everyone has different thoughts, so I didn't think there was a need to argue about it here.

But these guys are crossing the line a bit.

[Parma's surge? It's because they haven't faced us.]

[Lecce will definitely get promoted this season.]

[If Parma's Asian player played for our team, he would have been reduced to selling T-shirts.]

Hmm... they hit a sore spot.

Honestly, when I first joined, I did think I was just an event player at the level of selling T-shirts.

Of course, now it's different.

I have confidence that I am competitive enough in the professional league.

"Well... thinking about real monsters, I still have a long way to go."

Anyway.

Their public opinion campaign was quite effective.

It hurt my fragile soul.

"What? Fragile? You?"

The lazy guy looks at me with doubtful eyes.

I was really hurt.

Sob sob.

"Crazy guy."

Santiago looks at me like I'm a weirdo.

I think this lazy guy is weirder.

But I can't refute.

Giovanni and Gianluca also looked at me with peculiar eyes.

"Lately, seeing Mino, I think... wasn't that originally Mino's personality?"

"Maybe."

"I think Mino might be like this because he served in the military. My friend in the US military said the PTSD from military service was intense."

"Well, Mino also served in the military in Korea... he might have a lot of psychological scars."

These people.

They instantly make me a patient.

But strangely, I also think 'maybe?'

I've seen many people develop illnesses after suffering for 1 year and 9 months in the Korean military.

The... military veterans all empathize, right?

The military. That damn place.

I explained to the players that it wasn't that hard because of conscription.

In their eyes, I looked like a retired soldier with PTSD who rolled in a war zone for 2 years and then returned to football.

Ah, it's frustrating.

My military life was just being stuck in the admin office or playing soccer as an administrative soldier.

Anyway.

An incident happened.

It was caused by the phrase ‘Porco Dio.’

‘Porco Dio’ means ‘Pig God’ in English.

It doesn't sound like much of a curse, and in northern Italy, it's used to mean ‘Damn!’

But in southern Italy, it's a very severe curse.

This ‘Porco Dio’ is a severe curse because Italy is a very strict Catholic country, and in the past, blaspheming God was considered a serious crime.

Some people even paid fines of 50 to 300 euros for cursing in public with this phrase.

The reason I'm bringing this up is...

Parma is in the northern region.

Lecce is in the southern region.

Santiago dropped a sports drink at the hotel where we were staying for the away match and said ‘Porco Dio!’ which spread on SNS.

In the northern region of Parma, ‘Porco Dio’ isn't taken very seriously.

But in Lecce, it's different.

The home fans of southern Lecce went mad.

Starting with the blasphemy against God.

Some even said that the damn Argentine guy mocked the entire Lecce.

They were fiercely biting.

Thanks to that, SNS was in chaos.

Parma responded by saying, "It's not a good phrase, but it's commonly used in the north. What's the problem?"

Lecce retorted, "If it was in the north, we would understand, but he said it in a hotel in the south. So, it's an insult to the entire south and Lecce."

Was this the start?

Lecce fans began to hurl insults and leave malicious comments about Santiago and even me.

I didn't care much since I don't use SNS often.

But Santiago's SNS was a mess, and he was sulking.

But that was it.

The lazy guy, who was whining about his messed-up SNS, soon got distracted from this incident.

Seeing him foolishly smiling yesterday, relieved to be free from tough training for a while, it seemed there were no problems.

But.

This wasn't the end of the incident.

An incident that should have subsided by now suddenly erupted with unexpected participants.

[Comments]

-These damn bastards! How dare they bully our Minho? Want to taste some Korean Kimchi?

-These damn bastards, what? A T-shirt seller from Korea? Lecce bastards think they're Manchester United or something?

-F***ing F***ing F***ing Lecce! F***ing F***ing F***ing Lecce!

-A crazy player with 8 goals and 4 assists in 8 league matches, what? A T-shirt seller? Lecce, you'd lose to a Korean K-League player selling hotteok, okay?

-Lecce would be in the relegation zone in the K-League. Agree?

-Agree 100%. Comrade.

The sudden participation of Korean fans.

Lecce fans were greatly bewildered to see their fan page filled with incomprehensible words at a rapid pace.

The unexpectedly strong firepower.

I, too, was bewildered looking at Lecce's fan page that I had briefly checked.

"Why are Koreans showing up here?"
