## 9. Never Underestimate South Korea Again! (1)

Embarrassingly.

Recently in Korea, people have started calling me ‘Nael-lum-jwa’ because I was caught by the broadcast camera sticking out my tongue at Fabrizio, who was following me around in the Ascoli match and eventually got sent off.

Well, having a nickname is good, but.

With the nickname, I also felt that the expectations and interest towards me had deepened considerably.

My mother finally received a call from a distant relative asking to borrow money.

When she told me the news, my mother exclaimed, "You've finally become a star!" with admiration.

Anyway.

In the next match against Crotone, I played as a left winger again and scored multiple goals.

Thanks to that, I was awarded MVP again.

Having already received the MVP four times, I became the player leading Parma's charge to the top.

And then I flew back to Korea again.

I was called up to the national team again.

Honestly, I thought I wouldn’t be called up again after the last time, but our coach Pedro seems to like me more than I thought.

I don't know if he saw me playing in the third line in the last match, but he played me in the friendly match against Syria and the last World Cup Asian qualifier against Iran.

Honestly, I didn’t score any points in both matches, and this time all the main players were playing, so I didn’t really have to play in the second line.

Still, some experts praised me for carrying the ball well in the third line, so...

Well, I am satisfied with that.

Moreover, I was satisfied to be the protagonist of Korea's first away victory against Iran in the history of the A national team.

Although I didn’t play badly.

Indeed, the organic movements of senior Shin Junseo and the other second-line players were on another level.

- Shin Junseo! Shin Junseo goooal!

- And as we speak, the match ends!

- Finally! Korea achieves the great feat of winning their first away match against Iran!

Indeed, Shin Junseo is Shin Junseo.

There’s a reason he plays for Tottenham.

When I see his ability to dribble and run with the ball, I honestly doubt if this senior is even human.

Honestly, I couldn’t talk to him much during training.

But after all the matches ended and before returning to Italy, I could have a light dinner with the senior.

He said he was really happy to hear that I was playing football again.

Of course... it must be lip service, right?

Holding the Tottenham uniform that senior Shin Junseo gifted me, we took a photo together with big smiles.

Two hours after the photo was posted on senior Shin Junseo's SNS, I received a terrifying message from Monica.

- Monica: Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham? Tottenham?

That damn North London is the problem.

There must be some bad energy flowing in London, I am sure of it.

- Monica: Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone.

Or there must be some cosmic horror in the London sewers that drives people mad.

“Forco Dio!”

Monica is too scary.

I hope Arsenal wins so Monica doesn’t have such outbursts.

Please...

* * *

Even though the good atmosphere continues, nothing significant has changed in my life.

Although some Korean reporters came to Parma and caused a bit of trouble.

Well, that wasn’t a big problem.

On the contrary, Santiago.

It was evident that he slacked off during training during the international break.

“Like this! Do it like this.”

“No, that's something only Minho can do.”

This lazy guy grumbles again.

Why is this difficult?

Tap! I catch the ball.

Swish! I turn my body.

Bang! I kick with an out-front shot.

Quaresma special complete.

Is this difficult?

“Oh, it’s f*cking hard.”

But Santiago’s eyes are full of complaints.

You chose Quaresma.

Endure it with guts and perseverance.

“Ah! I don’t know! I don’t know! I’ll just practice what I’m good at! I don’t need this!”

In the end, he gave up and ran off somewhere to dribble excitedly.

But seeing that, I couldn’t help but admire Santiago’s talent.

How can he move like that there?

And make such decisions?

I heard that many clubs are showing interest in Parma recently.

I heard that scouts from several first-division teams came to our stadium in the last match.

Their targets were me and Santiago.

Anyway.

Lately, I’ve been putting a lot of effort into out-front shots, which I’m not very skilled at.

I worked hard to make my shooting and crossing smooth with both my right and left foot using out-front shots.

Thanks to that, I’ve somewhat adapted with my left foot.

But honestly, I still feel my right foot is lacking.

"Minho! Shall we take a break?"

Having run around like a dog.

Santiago comes to me, thinking it might be time to sneak in some rest.

But we can’t rest.

And this lazy guy shouldn’t rest either.

“Uh, we still have stamina training left.”

“Ah...”

Lately, Santiago’s concentration seems to drop in the latter part of the game, causing him to miss good passes frequently.

From what I feel, his stamina is somewhat similar to mine, which improved through consistent stamina training.

After all, he once ballooned up to 90kg in the off-season.

Because of the mistakes he made in the past.

So I pushed him harder.

I also honed my free kicks and passes under the strict guidance of senior Shin Junseo during my high school years.

Thanks to that, I alternated between being a starter and a rotation player in my senior year.

“Alright! Time for fun stamina training!”

“No, it’s absolutely not fun.”

The lazy guy grumbles with a sulky face.

But what can he do?

Behind me stands Parma’s legend.

Giovanni Buffon, staring sharply, makes the lazy guy whimper and eventually stand beside me to start running together.

Kid.

I told you to do it properly when you need to, didn’t I?

* * *

US Lecce.

A professional football team based in Lecce, Apulia, Italy, and our next opponent.

We have a peculiar connection with this team.

Well, it's an emotion they hold towards us.

In the 2019-20 season.

Lecce, who was in Serie A, could have stayed in 17th place if they won the final match against us, Parma.

But they were miserably defeated by Parma, finishing 18th in the league.

And thus, they were relegated to Serie B.

Of course, Parma also did terribly the next season and got relegated cleanly...

Anyway.

Perhaps because of this.

Lecce harbors bad feelings towards us.

Not to the level of a derby.

But enough to occasionally curse at us when they think of us?

In such a situation, the match between us, the league leaders, and Lecce, the fifth in the league, became quite a hot topic in Serie B.

But I found the next match against Benevento, the second in the league, more interesting.

Well... Different people have different opinions.

So I didn’t see the need to argue here.

But these guys are crossing the line a bit.

[Parma’s rise? It’s because they haven’t faced us.]

[Lecce will definitely get promoted this season.]

[If Parma’s Asian player played for our team, he would have ended up as a T-shirt seller.]

Hmm... They hit a sore spot.

To be honest, when I first joined, I really thought I was just an event player at the level of a T-shirt seller.

But now, it’s different.

I am confident that I have enough competitiveness in the professional league.

“Well... Thinking of real monsters, I still have a long way to go.”

Anyway.

Their public opinion campaign is quite effective.

Because it hurt my delicate soul.

“What? Delicate? You?”

The lazy guy looks at me with suspicious eyes.

But I am really hurt.

Sob sob.

“Crazy guy.”

Santiago looks at me like I’m a weirdo.

I think this lazy guy is weirder.

But I can’t argue against it.

Giovanni too.

Gianluca too.

They all look at me with strange eyes.

“Watching Minho these days... I wonder if this was Minho’s original personality.”

“Maybe so.”

“I think Minho might be like this because he served in the military. My American friend said that the PTSD he suffered during military service was immense.”

“Well, Minho also served in the military in Korea... So he might have a lot of psychological wounds.”

These people.

They instantly make me a patient.

But I can’t help but think, “What if?”

I’ve seen many people who developed illnesses after suffering for 1 year and 9 months in the Korean military.

All... Military veterans can relate.

The military. That damn place.

I tried to explain to the players that conscription wasn’t that hard.

But in their eyes, I looked like a veteran who suffered from PTSD after two years on the battlefield and is challenging football again.

Oh, it’s frustrating.

My military life was just being cooped up in the admin office.

Or playing football happily as an administrative soldier.

Anyway.

Something happened.

It started because of the words ‘Porco Dio.’

Porco Dio.

In English, it means ‘Pig God.’

It doesn’t sound much like a curse, and in northern Italy, it’s used to say ‘Damn!’

However.

In the south, this word is a very severe curse.

The reason why Porco Dio is a heavy curse is that Italy is a very devout Catholic country among European nations, and in the past, blasphemy was considered a severe crime in Italy.

This word ‘Porco Dio’ is a blasphemous word, so some people were fined between 50 and 300 euros for using this curse in public places.

The reason why I’m bringing this up now is that.

Parma is in the northern region.

Lecce is a team in the southern region.

Santiago, while staying at a hotel for an away game, dropped a sports drink and said ‘Porco Dio!’, which spread on SNS.

Parma doesn’t take ‘Porco Dio’ very seriously since it's a northern region.

But Lecce is different.

The home fans of southern Lecce were furious.

Starting from blasphemy.

Some even said that the damn Argentine mocked all of Lecce.

They fiercely attacked us.

Thanks to that, there was an uproar on SNS.

Parma reacted by saying, “It’s not a good word, but it’s commonly used in the north. What’s the problem?”

Lecce responded angrily, “Even if it’s common in the north, the hotel he is staying at is in the south. So the curse insulted the entire south and Lecce.”

This incident somehow escalated.

Lecce fans started to hurl strong curses and malicious comments not only at Santiago but also at me.

I didn’t care much since I rarely use SNS.

But Santiago’s SNS was a mess, and he was on the verge of tears.

But that was it.

The lazy guy, who was whining about his ruined SNS, soon turned his attention away from this incident.

Seeing him foolishly grinning about having a rare chance to relax from hard training yesterday, I thought there was no problem.

However.

This incident didn’t end there.

An incident that should have calmed down by now suddenly became lively again due to unexpected participants.

[Comments]

- These bastards! How dare they mess with our Minho? Do you want to taste Korean kimchi?

- Damn bastards, what? A T-shirt seller from Korea? Those Lecce bastards act like they are Manchester United even though they're in Serie B?

- Fucking Lecce! Fucking Lecce!

- A crazy player scoring 8 goals and 4 assists in 8 league matches, what? A T-shirt seller? If Lecce were in the K League, they’d even lose to a hodu-gwaja (walnut cookie) seller, okay?

- If Lecce comes to the K League, they'd be in the relegation zone. Agree?

- Totally agree, comrade.

Suddenly, Korean fans joined in.

The fans of Lecce were greatly bewildered as their fan page was quickly filled with incomprehensible words.

The unexpectedly strong firepower.

I was also taken aback while looking at Lecce's fan page.

“Why are Koreans here?”
