## 45. King Henry, King Salah, God Minho (3)

The North London Derby is the North London Derby.

Even after scoring the first goal, Tottenham's players maintained their offensive stance, targeting Arsenal's defensive gaps.

Of course, Arsenal, having scored first, handled Tottenham's attacks with ease.

The one in a rush was Tottenham.

There was no helping it.

Losing to Arsenal, especially at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, was something that should never happen. Tottenham's players knew this.

So they fought fiercely.

Of course, Arsenal was no different.

That's what a derby match was.

A game fought more intensely than a war.

A match you absolutely must not lose.

That's a derby, and that’s why the players from both teams were fiercely competing today, regardless of their rankings.

"Hey! To the left!"

"Pass deeper! What are you doing? They're stealing the ball too easily and counterattacking!"

"Press hard! Don't leave Minho alone!"

The shouts and heavy breaths of the players from both teams mixed with the boos from the Spurs fans on the field.

The fans were displeased with the team's current ranking.

And they were booing the players for showing an unsatisfactory performance despite losing to Arsenal.

- Tottenham is struggling in today’s game. As the first half is nearing its end, they are trailing 1-0 to Arsenal, who is comfortably leading the game thanks to Minho's goal.

- This is the problem. The reason Tottenham is struggling in the lower part of the league this season is because, except for Kane, they don't have any reliable attacking options.

- Exactly.

- Defensively, they have mid-to-upper league stats, but in attack… Except for Kane, there isn’t a single player contributing significantly.

- To be precise, their attack stats are ranked 15th in the league. Most of the goals have been scored solely by Kane.

Most of their losses were 1-0.

Even the games they won or drew were mostly due to Kane scoring.

Experts were focused on Tottenham's poor performance due to their lack of high-scoring victories.

A cross followed.

Tottenham assigned Vigo Kier as the marker for Lorenzo Lufo, given his height advantage, even though Vigo was 10 cm shorter than Lorenzo, he was still competing for aerial balls.

- Vigo Kier wins the aerial duel!

- And here comes Tottenham’s counterattack!

- A long pass forward! The player receiving it is Harriet Kane!

- Kane! Kane! Pushing Daniel Saliba aside and shoooots! Goooooooal!

- Equalizing goooooooal! Harriet Kane finally scores, making it 1-1!

Waaaaaaaah!

The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium erupted in cheers for none other than Harriet Kane’s goal.

Simultaneously, the first half ended, leaving the Arsenal players with disappointed expressions.

The Spurs' chants of support for Tottenham, hoping for a victory in the second half, filled the air.

* * *

The first half ended.

The players' expressions weren’t great after conceding a late goal.

However, the gameplay itself was good.

Even our coach acknowledged that part.

He said that since the opponent lived up to the name of the North London Derby, we just need to play even harder in the second half.

Although we had the momentum with the first goal, the heat of the North London Derby was enough motivation for the struggling Tottenham.

As a result, we had no choice but to concede a goal late in the first half.

Even though we had the advantage with the opening goal.

Honestly, we were stronger than the opponent, but the North London Derby was still special.

"Let's keep our focus in the second half. If we just be cautious of their quick counterattacks that we allowed at the end of the first half, we can definitely win."

Listening to our coach's encouragement, I munched on a banana and pondered on how to move in the second half.

With the intense pressure from the opponent, it was tough to dribble the ball up directly.

In the end, coordination was key.

Of course, I didn't need to drop back to the midfield to receive the ball like Kane.

There were plenty of high-level players in Arsenal who could link up in my stead.

"Ah! If I had played today, a hat-trick would have been a given…"

Lorenzo chuckled as he slurped down an energy gel at Amani Richards’ words.

As a pro, such confidence is important, I thought.

Though he’s just a backup now, I believed Amani had tremendous potential.

I think he could grow to a world-class level within 1-2 years.

If things go well, that is.

Yeah, if things go really well.

Anyway.

Thanks to Amani's grumbling, the players forgot the regret of conceding a goal late in the first half.

The bad atmosphere that had seeped into the locker room seemed to have been ventilated a bit.

If we maintained our good performance in the second half like we did in the first half, there was no reason for us to lose today.

"Alright! Let’s go and smash those dumb Spurs like Amani is confident enough for a hat-trick!"

Everyone burst into laughter at our captain Tierney's shout.

Amani tilted his head, saying, "Why? I really can do it."

Clearing our minds.

After a good 15-minute rest, the players headed back to the field.

- The second half is about to begin.

- As expected! The North London Derby never disappoints! Arsenal's performance in the first half was overwhelmingly superior, but… The score is tied at 1-1.

- Exactly. That’s why derby matches are so unpredictable. Even with a clear difference in performance, the special nature of a ‘derby’ makes it all meaningless.

- And here it is! The second half begins!

The second half began.

The intensity of the North London Derby seemed even higher in the second half than in the first.

Midfield turned into a brutal battleground.

In an aerial duel, our youngest midfielder Jake Francis and their midfielder Davis Seibalt elbowed each other in the face, causing both to have nosebleeds.

Of course, both players received cards.

As a result, the atmosphere on both sides became even more heated.

With the players getting more intense, the ball started moving faster between the two sides.

This led to an increase in mistakes from both teams.

With the tempo increasing, both teams' players were reacting more emotionally than rationally.

In such cases, the more composed team often wins.

This happens frequently in amateur football, and it’s no different in professional games.

Arsenal's midfield was gradually taking over.

Yes, the more composed side was our team, comfortably leading the league in first place.

As I glanced around, I noticed Tottenham’s defense tightening their pressure on me.

Due to my opening goal, it seemed they were marking me even more closely.

Of course, even if it wasn’t for that, no team would leave a striker who scores over 40 goals in a season unchecked.

Tottenham’s defense started to lower their line.

This made it difficult to target their defensive gaps, but it also revealed spaces between their midfield and defense.

“Well… they’re not exactly like Atlético Madrid from the past.”

If Tottenham could play a two-line defense, they wouldn’t be in their current position.

Targeting this well could definitely lead to a goal… It seemed Gabriel had the same thought.

He signaled with his eyes that we should create something using the space.

Alright, let's make something happen.

I really want to break Alan Shearer’s record.

Especially against Tottenham.

* * *

The atmosphere was tense.

But the emotions felt by the players from both teams were different.

Arsenal was composed, while Tottenham, with a chased expression, focused on defense.

In such a situation, Tottenham's defense had no choice but to focus on Arsenal's ace and phenomenal goal scorer, Park Minho.

There was no helping it.

In a situation where they were outmatched, the first thing Tottenham had to do was defend solidly.

Even with good defense, they could at least secure a draw.

Even if Park Minho broke through Tottenham's defense, it was tough for him to get past several players alone.

The problem was that Arsenal was not a team reliant on Park Minho.

Lorenzo, Gabriel, Campos, Ødegaard, etc.

There were many excellent players on the field who could deliver sharp passes to Park Minho.

Naturally, Park Minho utilized those players.

Especially Gabriel Martinelli, who had just returned from injury and was darting across the field, shaking Tottenham's defense while exchanging passes with Park Minho.

"F***ing bastard!"

"Block him! Block that bastard!"

Tottenham’s defenders screamed almost in agony as Gabriel swiftly exploited the space left unattended due to their focus on Park Minho.

Thud!

Seeing the ball hit the post and go out, the Spurs breathed a sigh of relief.

But leaving Park Minho unchecked… His performance in the first half still lingered in their minds.

"God… I miss him."

"Why did he leave for Man United?"

"You idiots cursed him as a washed-up player!"

"Junseo seemed happier at Tottenham… He doesn’t look happy at Man United."

"You f***ing idiots! Didn’t you call him washed up?"

Some Spurs fans argued amongst themselves.

Park Minho’s performance reminded them of Shin Junseo, who had led Tottenham's attack along with Kane last season before leaving.

In that chaotic situation, Gabriel slyly checked Park Minho’s position.

‘We can really create something here.’

As Park Minho moved like bait, drawing attention, and Gabriel cut into the open space a couple of times, the confused Spurs defenders didn't know where to focus.

This created a gap in Tottenham's defense that Gabriel didn't miss.

“Huff!”

Gabriel exhaled deeply.

He dribbled the ball up slowly.

- Gabriel! Slowly advancing along the flank.

- Tottenham’s defense must be in a dilemma! Gabriel’s form is sharper than expected today, isn’t it?

- Indeed. Leaving Gabriel unchecked is risky. He’s a highly skilled player. Tottenham seems quite burdened by him.

‘Let’s deliver an excellent pass.’

With that thought, Gabriel dribbled up and passed the ball to Park Minho, who was cutting in between the defenders and midfielders.

Though the pass had a bit too much power,

Gabriel didn’t think it was a mistake.

‘Minho can handle this much…’

To him, Park Minho was a football god.

He believed a player of such caliber could easily cover for his mistake.

Naturally, Park Minho received the hard-driven pass with a soft touch and cut inside.

The Tottenham defenders were taken aback by his smooth movement, despite the powerful pass from the opposite flank, and failed to stop his breakthrough.

"What the hell are you doing? Get your heads together! F***ing bastards! Stop him! Stop him!"

Tottenham's goalkeeper Jack Stephan shouted almost in panic as the defenders finally snapped back to reality.

They hurriedly rushed in, attempting to block him.

But as soon as their focus shifted to Park Minho, he casually flicked the ball sideways.

Gabriel was in that spot.

- Gabriel is unmarked!

Gabriel knew.

It was better to score from here.

But he had a crazy thought.

He knew Park Minho was chasing a new record.

So he boldly gave it up.

He gave up a perfect scoring chance.

Some might think he was crazy.

But Gabriel thought it would be incredibly fun to pull off a crazy move against Tottenham.

Flick!

"Huh?"

Jack Stephan, who had come forward, was momentarily bewildered as he saw the ball rolling away.

Park Minho, who was pushing past two defenders, slid in, shooting.

"Aah!"

Noticing it too late.

As he slid on the field,

Park Minho also slid, gently pushing the ball to the opposite side of the goalkeeper.

Roll… Thud!

The ball quickly rolled across the field and hit Tottenham’s net.

- Gooooooooooooal!

- Minhoooooooo! League goal number 34! Minho ties Alan Shearer's record!

- Waaaaaaaah! He breaks the EPL single-season scoring record from the 42-round era!

- King Henry! King Salah! He surpasses both of their records and now ties with Alan Shearer! This player is Minho! God Minho! No, Minho God! Arsenal’s deity stabs Tottenham!

Park Minho sprinted to the corner.

Then, running up to the broadcasting camera near the corner, he raised three fingers and shouted.

"One more goal for the hat-trick."

"Come ooooon!"

"Minhooooooo!"

"God Minho! God Minho! God Minho!"

"Ahhhh! The god has descended!"

As soon as he finished his words, the Arsenal players, filled with fervor, rushed towards Park Minho.
