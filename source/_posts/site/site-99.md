## 37. North London Derby (2)

-Whoooosh! Ah! Minho's free kick narrowly misses! It was such a good attempt... It's hitting the post and going over!

The young defender from Brazil.

Kaiki raised his alertness as he watched Park Minho's threatening free kick.

Gulp.

He swallowed dryly and refocused on the game.

In fact, he had no intention of transferring to Tottenham.

The league he initially considered was Serie A.

The reason was obviousâ€”the presence right in front of him.

It was because of Park Minho.

'I can't believe I'll be playing in the same league as Minho.'

Kaiki's interest in Park Minho started because of his pro debut episode posted on SNS.

The process of a suddenly appearing spectator scoring a goal in the preseason, signing with the club, and becoming a pro was a huge shock to Kaiki Fernandes.

And as he watched videos of Park Minho's continual growth over time, Kaiki began to dream.

He dreamt of one day becoming the best defender who would stop that player.

Kaiki Fernandes, who had honed his skills in Brazil, finally caught the attention of the European football scene.

With an overwhelming work rate and movement that belied his 190cm frame, his suffocating defense was based on astonishing agility.

Moreover, he had excellent positioning, flexible linking, and ball control skills, transforming into an all-round defender. European scouts were confident in his success.

A few experts even gushed, 'The Ferdinand of Brazil has appeared!'

Kaiki Fernandes resembled Rio Ferdinand, who led Manchester United's golden era.

Naturally, multiple clubs reached out with active courtship for his acquisition.

However, Kaiki Fernandes was resolute.

He wanted to transfer to the club where Park Minho was.

The problem was that Park Minho had transferred to Arsenal, and Arsenal's defense was already saturated, leaving no room for Kaiki Fernandes.

'Should I stay in Brazil for another year?'

While Kaiki was contemplating, one club approached him.

It was 'Tottenham.'

They approached him knowing that Kaiki was interested in Arsenal.

This indicated how desperate they were to bolster their defense, and they used Kaiki's interest in Park Minho to their advantage.

-Tottenham is a rival of Arsenal, where Minho transferred.

-You can face him directly in matches often and leave a strong impression on Arsenal and Minho later.

-Plus, Arsenal is a team based in the same London area, close to Tottenham.

Swayed by Tottenham scouts' sweet talk, Kaiki Fernandes accepted.

He wanted to meet Park Minho in person, no matter what.

So he decided to transfer to Tottenham.

Of course, Tottenham showed a significant improvement with the acquisition of Kaiki Fernandes.

They barely climbed to 14th place from the relegation zone thanks to Kaiki Fernandes' relentless defense.

Tottenham was in a dire overall situation.

The team's attack route had become simple due to the transfer of Harriet Kane and Shin Junseo, who were responsible for the team's goals, to Manchester United, and Kaiki alone was holding the defense.

Moreover, Jack Steffen, an American goalkeeper brought in to replace the aging Lloris, frequently showed lapses in concentration, causing Spurs fans' hearts to race.

However, Kaiki Fernandes didn't care.

He believed that if he did his job, the team's performance would eventually improve.

And then came the North London Derby.

He was more excited than anyone.

A heated match against a local rival team.

It would be a rough game, but undoubtedly an intense match that would ignite a man's heart awaited.

Kaiki Fernandes was convinced of that.

'It's going to be an amazing match.'

But.

Contrary to his expectations, the North London Derby was terrible.

It was odd to take a massive bus for a mere 4km trip from Tottenham's area to Emirates Stadium.

When a teammate said, 'Did you know this bus's windows are bulletproof?' Kaiki slowly realized something was wrong.

Seeing 5-6 police vehicles escorting them and the club manager warning them to 'lower your heads and put them between your knees,' Kaiki realized that the two teams sharing the same hometown were almost at the level of hatred.

He realized that the Tottenham scout had lied to him.

'Leave a strong impression on Arsenal and Minho? Not this kind of impression!'

As soon as they crossed into Arsenal's area, lighters, beer bottles, and all sorts of trash began flying toward them.

Seeing even rocks being thrown, Kaiki ducked in fright.

When they finally reached near Emirates Stadium and the extreme fans' actions ceased, Kaiki couldn't calm his pounding heart.

Kaiki asked the team captain, Harriet Kane, in the locker room.

"Is it always like this?"

Harriet Kane smiled and replied to his question.

"It's what they go through at our home. Do you think our fans will let them leave our home smoothly?"

Hearing that, Kaiki Fernandes was appalled at the completely different relationship between the two teams than he had imagined.

At the same time, the thought of being doomed flashed through his mind.

With the relationship between the two teams in such a mess... Can he really transfer to Arsenal where Park Minho is?

He imagined a South American-style ending where he would definitely be shot if he transferred to Arsenal.

And so the game began.

Kaiki Fernandes, gazing at Park Minho with wistful eyes, thought.

Still, there's nothing better than seeing his idol on the field in person.

Of course, contrary to such sentiments, Tottenham was being thoroughly swayed by Arsenal's attacks.

Kaiki was trying his best to stop passes leading to goals in front of Park Minho, but it was impossible to stop all of Arsenal's attacks alone.

Minoooooooo!

Go! Minho! Minho!

Waaaaaah!

Emirates Stadium shook with cheers.

As soon as he lost the ball, Park Minho grabbed it and showed terrifying dribbling again.

An overwhelming dribbler with outstanding skills began to pick up speed.

Tap! Tap!

Tottenham's defenders collapsed like animals hit by tranquilizer darts after two touches.

With a quick glance at Tottenham's goal, Park Minho took a clean shot.

It was a flawless shot without hesitation.

Thud!

The perfectly curved ball passed by Tottenham's goalkeeper Jack Steffen and shook the net.

It was the first goal of the match.

As soon as Park Minho's goal went in, the home fans at Emirates Stadium erupted in cheers.

Come oooon!

Minooooo! Minooooo!

Waaaaah!

Kaiki Fernandes thought as he watched the scene.

He would have to keep his head down in the bus on the way back after the game.

* * *

I scored the first goal by exploiting the gap allowed by the Brazilian friend who was staring at me like a pervert.

Honestly, that guy's defense is pretty solid.

Given that the first goal came after a little over 30 minutes into the first half, it was true that I had a bit of a hard time with his defense.

But it wasn't extremely difficult.

It just meant I had a bit of trouble.

Anyway.

As soon as the first goal came, the flow of the game shifted heavily in Arsenal's favor.

At the same time, I could see with my own eyes why Tottenham was struggling at 14th place in the league.

"It's a mess."

Yeah, it was a mess.

Except for a few players, Tottenham was showing movements that were close to an overall disaster.

Hwang Mario, who joined the team as a replacement for Shin Junseo, was struggling to adapt to the fast tempo of the EPL, committing six turnovers in just over 30 minutes of the first half.

Central midfielder Davis Seibalt was failing to inject any vitality into Tottenham's midfield.

Only Harriet Kane, Peter Emil Hojbjerg, and Kaiki Fernandes were barely holding the team together.

And in the added time just over 45 minutes into the first half, Arsenal scored their second goal.

Tyler Smith Rowe, receiving the pass I threaded, finished with a clean shot.

He ran to me and shouted.

"Minhooo! You're the best! You're the best!"

It was surprising to see Tyler so delighted when we had only made it 2-0.

Maybe it's the unique nature of the North London Derby?

The players' expressions seemed more intense than usual.

I was a bit surprised that the players seemed more determined to win than in other matches.

Of course, this heightened emotion didn't only have positive aspects.

Tweet!

A foul by Tottenham just before the end of the first half.

Captain Tyron Tierney was down, clutching his knee.

The referee showed a card to Tottenham's wingback Emerson for the foul.

-The game is getting rougher!

-Oh! Eventually, Tyron Tierney can't get up and is being carried off on a stretcher.

-Coach Alain Levagne urgently brings in Castor Nilsson!

-Arsenal faces an unfavorable situation just before the end of the first half!

Of course, Arsenal wouldn't just take it lying down.

Before the additional time even ended, a Tottenham player was lying on the field.

The two teams' players exchanged insults or engaged in verbal spats as they faced each other.

-Hwang Mario is limping off the field! And Lucas Torreira is coming on as a substitute!

-Oh! As soon as Lucas comes on, the referee ends the first half!

Booooo!

An enormous booing erupted.

This was the North London Derby, it seemed.

A rough physical battle almost like a war unfolded in the last moments of the first half, with two players being sidelined due to injuries.

Italy was also incredibly rough.

England was comparably rough.

On the way to the locker room, Tottenham's defender Viktor Lundgren muttered something while looking at me.

What, is he saying he'll kill me in the second half?

Honestly, I'm a rather gentlemanly person and don't particularly enjoy such rough games, but if the opponent targets my injury and comes out rough, I won't just stand still and take it.

"Indeed... I am quite the gentleman."

I could feel Bruno Campos looking at me with a strange gaze after hearing my muttered words, but I ignored him.

No, I'm really a nice guy, okay?

Ignoring Bruno Campos' impure gaze, I prepared for the second half in the locker room.

After a brief period of time.

It was time to head out to the field.

The players' eyes were different from usual.

Honestly, they were filled with determination to the point of being a bit scary.

And then the second half began.

Arsenal players entered the field with quite confident expressions, but I knew very well that something bad always happens when people are overly confident.

Yeah, usually it happens in the army.

When people are confident or relaxed.

Stars fall, or the military police come, or all sorts of inexplicable incidents and accidents occur.

Anyway.

Soccer is a strange sport where you can be leading comfortably but lose due to a silly mistake and end up getting overturned, so you have to be even more careful.

"Especially in a derby match."

Think about it.

-Are you losing 0-3 in a Korea-Japan match?

If that were the case, the Korean players on the field would do everything short of illegal activities to at least salvage a draw.

That's what the North London Derby is like.

As soon as the second half started, I could feel that Tottenham was starting to fight back.

They were losing in a London version of a Korea-Japan match.

Would they just sit back and take it?

I wouldn't.

"Focus! Focus!"

"Block! They're coming in from the flank!"

Unlike the first half, Tottenham came out more aggressive and took control in the early second half.

Tottenham is certainly not a weak team.

Despite the chaotic state of the team, their determination to create a goal somehow is commendable.

But.

Why does a goal come as soon as I commend someone?

-Goooooal! Harriet Kaaane!

-Tottenham pulls back to 2-1! The outcome of the North London Derby is still undecided! Tottenham reignites the spark of competition!

Indeed, England's top striker is different.

He seized one of the few opportunities and took a shot.

Even though Marlon Ramsdale dived, he couldn't prevent the net from shaking.

Watching that scene, I thought.

The North London Derby had only just begun.
