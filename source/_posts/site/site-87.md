## 31. Summer, Transfer, Rest (1)

[Inter! Acquires key Parma defender Klazi Tursha for 45 million euros!]

[PSG signs Parma's central midfielder Perelle Canasini for 39 million euros!]

The interest poured in as soon as the season ended.

The big clubs that had been eyeing Parma’s players rushed in as soon as the Serie A transfer market opened.

Thanks to that, two players left Parma.

It was a natural story.

Didn’t most of Leicester City's key players leave the team with a hefty transfer fee?

Of course, players like James Vardy stayed.

Anyway.

Parma followed a similar trend.

Probably a few more players will leave.

What was fortunate for Parma was that Joshua and Kenez renewed their contracts.

The two players will stay with Parma until the next season.

Jose Juan also didn't seem to want to leave.

Now, let's talk about me.

The story of my transfer was a bit sluggish.

The reason, of course, was because of a certain striker.

[Edan Holland! Where will he head to?]

[Real Madrid announces plans to form a super Galactico with Mbappe-Holland-Mino trio!]

[Manchester City, Liverpool, Manchester United, Real Madrid, PSG, etc. Big clubs prefer Holland!]

Edan Holland was on the market.

And as a free agent, no less.

Honestly, my performance this season was much better than Holland’s, but it seemed my short career was holding me back.

The big clubs seemed to think my performance was slightly inflated.

Moreover, the fact that I had a buyout clause of 52 million euros, making me available anytime, seemed to reduce the interest in me a bit.

They thought of me as a caught fish.

Thanks to that, the big clubs seemed to be focusing on Holland, who was out as a free agent.

Thanks to this, Leo seemed to be quite angry.

He made a huge wage offer, saying ‘I won’t transfer for anything less than this amount!’

Honestly, it was a huge amount even to me.

Of course, Leo seemed to think I deserved that level of wages.

It meant I was not lacking compared to Edan Holland.

Well, I was a bit happy that Leo thought of me that way.

Anyway.

Leo will send me the filtered offers... I just have to wait quietly.

So, what am I doing now?

I’m resting in Korea with Monica.

After the season ended, I couldn’t join the national team.

I slightly injured my ankle in the last round of Serie A.

I was told to rest for three weeks.

Thanks to that, our national team coach, Kim Yonggap, looked quite upset over the phone.

He asked if I’d consider playing with painkillers, saying the most important resource in his tiki-taka was gone.

Monica laughed at that.

“What a crazy guy.”

Well, I quietly expressed my refusal.

Seeing the old man express some dissatisfaction with me in the media, I shook my head.

Leo was furious and openly disclosed our conversation, and the old man had no choice but to focus on the Asian Cup, getting criticized.

South Korea was strong in the Asian Cup.

Even though they used a mismatched tactic.

South Korea as a team might be lacking in some aspects globally, but in Asia, they were a formidable force.

They quickly reached the Asian Cup final.

The opponent was Japan, South Korea's eternal rival.

“This is... the national team?”

But the final was a disastrous match.

I wondered how such a team could have reached the quarterfinals in the Qatar World Cup.

- Ah... South Korea loses 2-1 to Japan in the Asian Cup final.

- The football was too sloppy. How did this team reach the quarterfinals in the Qatar World Cup?

The commentators sighed.

Sneaking a look at the community on my smartphone, I saw almost traitorous insults.

Of course, directed at our coach, Yonggap.

- What a stupid coach, lol.

- Cartoon football season 2, lol.

- As soon as Park Minho is gone, they get exposed, lol. The national team should swim back, lol.

- Shin Junseo brought them to the finals single-handedly... the rest of the dwarfs crapped themselves, lol.

- We miss you... Park Minho!

- Change the coach... seriously, it's disgusting.

- How is that guy the national team coach? When was tiki-taka in fashion?

Was this a bit mild?

Well... the players really ran themselves ragged.

Maybe they were given some leniency.

Anyway.

Asian Cup runners-up.

Our coach Yonggap eventually had to step down from the national team position.

Coach Kim Yonggap, who took responsibility for the media and the national team’s performance, cried and shouted, 'Please give me one more chance!' at the press conference.

That last scene, I’m confident, was the greatest comedy show in South Korea’s history.

Is this the shortest-lived has-been?

The Asian Cup final was nothing but astonishing.

* * *

Resting in Korea was the best.

Ah, I introduced Monica to my family... My mother was moved to tears, saying, ‘You finally know what dating is!’

I don’t know what she thought of me.

I’m quite knowledgeable about dating.

Reading my expression, Monica smiled, as if asking ‘Do you really think so?’

I could only bow my head quietly.

Anyway.

I shot a lot of delayed commercials after a long time.

I really shot them like crazy.

Someone might look at me and ask, ‘Are you crazy for money?’ but I’d like to ask for understanding, as I’m earning hard for charity.

Especially since I plan to build a center for kids who can’t afford to learn football, I thought I had to earn even more.

That’s why I asked Leo to prioritize wages and money in this transfer.

I’ve experienced winning a bit anyway.

I thought I had to keep earning, as the money would soon disappear if I built a youth center in Korea.

However, no matter how urgent it was, I skipped this commercial.

-Super Bean! Super Bean! Super Super! Super Bean!

The weird ice cream commercial Junseo hyung advertised.

I couldn’t shoot that one either.

I didn’t want to create a black history.

Anyway.

Time in Korea flew by.

Meanwhile, the transfer market was quite noisy with various rumors.

[Holland to Liverpool?]

[Liverpool! In the final stages of a deal with Holland?]

[Manchester United! Acquires Barcelona’s Derick De Jong!]

[Transfer fee of 130 million pounds! Manchester United brings Derick De Jong from Barcelona!]

It started with Manchester United.

They brought Derick De Jong, who had been holding the center of Barcelona after Messi left, for 130 million pounds.

Well, that's approximately 210 billion won in Korean currency.

Following that, Manchester City drew their sword and stepped into the transfer market.

[It wasn’t Holland! Manchester City! Acquires Real Madrid’s Gerardo Valverde!]

[Real Madrid! Why did they sell Valverde, a key member of the second golden midfield?]

[Real Madrid, which declared a super Galactico! Really planning to form the ‘Mbappe-Holland-Mino’ trio?]

[Real Madrid renews contract with Vinicius Junior! Will they only sign one of Holland and Mino?]

[West Ham’s Heklan Rice! Rejects Arsenal’s love call and moves to PSG!]

Various player transfer news followed.

Real Madrid even sold an important midfielder resource to Manchester City at a high price to raise funds.

It seemed Real Madrid had given up on me.

Because they had Mbappe and Vinicius.

Leo also informed me that Real Madrid and Munich had withdrawn from negotiations.

The transfer market, which had entered a brief lull, became noisy again.

This time, it was Manchester City.

Manchester City’s spending didn’t end with the acquisition of Valverde.

[Manchester City! Interested in signing Shin Junseo!]

Their target was Junseo hyung.

* * *

“That? It’s just a rumor.”

“Oh... really?”

Junseo hyung, whom I met at a chicken restaurant, shook his head, saying the transfer rumor to Manchester City was just a rumor.

But he said the transfer matter was true.

“I requested a transfer... Watching you win with Parma made me want to win even more.”

“Hyung, you can win wherever you go.”

Junseo hyung smiled at my reply.

As if he really hoped so.

Anyway.

After meeting everyone I could in Korea, I returned to Italy with Monica.

To pack my things and say my last goodbyes to Parma and the fans.

“Mino.”

It was Banjiri.

Santiago looked at me with teary eyes.

It was like the eyes of a friend looking at someone with a terminal illness.

I mean, I’m not a patient... I don’t understand why he’s tearing up.

Others soon arrived to see me off.

Kenez, Filippo, Joshua, etc.

Friends I was close with and some I had a bit of a distant feel with also came to see me.

After greeting them, I slowly walked up to the podium set up in the middle of Ennio Tardini, our home ground.

More than 20,000 Parma fans were looking at me with teary eyes.

I thought they did this for everyone.

But apparently, they don’t usually do this.

Banjiri asked a club official.

He asked if they could do this for him too.

Then the official reportedly said this.

-If Santiago scores 20 goals and 20 assists every season and leads the league to three consecutive wins, it’s possible.

Yeah, it meant it was an absurd request.

Anyway.

I felt a bit moved deep in my heart receiving this kind of treatment while leaving.

Oh, I’m not the only one leaving.

Our coach is also resigning.

I don’t know the reason, but he was smiling slyly at me.

Tap-tap!

After checking if the mic worked well by tapping it a few times, I opened my mouth.

“I’m going on a long journey.”

“A mere 25-year-old debuted in this great Parma and is leaving at 26.”

“Parma is like my hometown.”

“I will definitely come back when I have the strength.”

“Let’s meet again, great Parma.”

When I finished speaking.

More than 20,000 Parma fans stood up and gave me a round of applause.

I tried to smile seeing that.

No, I tried to smile... but tears came out.

Really... I’m not a person who cries a lot.

Strangely, my eyes felt moist.

* * *

Leo Carpentieri contacted me.

He brought the first round of organized contracts.

The remaining clubs were a total of six, all of which had considerable fame.

-Real Madrid

-Manchester City

-Bayern Munich

-Paris Saint-Germain

-Atletico Madrid

-Arsenal

Except for one unexpected team... all were clubs that had advanced to the Champions League.

“First... these are the conditions from Real Madrid.”

The conditions weren’t bad.

The options weren’t bad either, and the contract terms were good.

However... the wage caught my eye.

“It’s a bit low?”

“I think so too. It feels a bit lacking compared to what Mino wants.”

“Hmm... I see.”

Real Madrid was on hold for now.

Next was Manchester City.

I wondered if they had room after acquiring Valverde, but the power of oil capital seemed tremendous.

“The wages are definitely higher than Real Madrid’s.”

“Right. But it’s not a satisfactory amount.”

Well, it’s just the first offer.

You can’t be full with the first bite.

I nodded and looked at the other contracts.

They were all similar.

Except for one club.

“......”

“......”

I had to doubt my eyes for a moment, seeing the wages they offered.

Was this club known to spend like this?

“450,000 pounds?”

“Yes, they offered the highest amount.”

That amount... when Salvador Sanchez moved from Arsenal to Manchester United, he earned a weekly wage of 500,000 pounds.

It’s 50,000 pounds less than that amount.

Right, this club offered me a weekly wage of over 700 million won in Korean currency.

It was Arsenal.

If I transfer to Arsenal, I could become the ‘77 billion man’ too.

“Has Arsenal gone mad?”

“Is it okay for them to spend like this?”

“Where do they even have the money?”

Leo just shook his head and smiled at my question.
