## 47. 4senal (3)

The grueling month of April is finally coming to an end.

After a draw against Everton on April 24, our next match against Brentford will determine if we clinch the championship.

Of course, to achieve an undefeated championship, we cannot afford to be complacent until the very last match of the league.

Still, with April nearly over, the players' faces were brighter than usual.

Fortunately, Tyrone Tierney, who had left the field due to injury in the FA Cup semifinals, wasn't seriously hurt and could play in the Brentford match on April 27.

Knowing that we could get through April if we just finished strong, the team's atmosphere was quite upbeat.

"This is all thanks to Minho."

"That's right. Minho kept scoring crucial goals during tough times. Honestly, I thought we'd either be knocked out of the FA Cup or record at least one loss in the league."

"Let's handle the remaining five league matches well and also do our best in the FA Cup final and Europa League semifinals."

"We must win. This is a rare chance to win multiple competitions and record a mini-treble."

Yeah, when the atmosphere is this good, it makes you want to play football.

Honestly, the recent atmosphere had been too gloomy.

Oh, after the FA Cup semifinals, Junseo hyung contacted me.

He said he was feeling a bit down, so we met up for dinner after the match, and he ate enthusiastically.

Indeed... people seem happiest when they're eating delicious food.

It wasn't just the players and fans who were impressed by our tenacity.

Jade Kroenke.

Our backer was also deeply moved by Arsenal's recent form and was growing more optimistic about the next season.

Naturally, he encouraged the players by saying he'd make a significant investment after this season.

A significant investment meant increasing the players' weekly wages through new contracts. Honestly, which player wouldn't like this news?

Oh, I got another call from Leo.

I heard that Arsenal wants to renew my contract after this season, but honestly, I thought I wasn't a renewal candidate because I still had a lot of time left on my current contract.

But Arsenal seemed to think otherwise.

They are suggesting a five-year contract with a higher weekly wage than now.

This means they like me a lot, so I don't see why I shouldn't accept.

Monica also likes me playing at Arsenal, and I don't have any major complaints either.

But why is Arsenal so desperate to renew my contract as if their pants are on fire?

There are still several years left on my current contract.

* * *

[Real Madrid insider: ‘The board is still eyeing a super Galactico trio of Mbappe, Haaland, and Minho. They will never give up.’]

[Massive attention on Minho, who has shown overwhelming performance in his first EPL season!]

[Can Arsenal keep Minho? Minho's value has tripled since his transfer from Parma!]

[Gunners: ‘If Minho leaves the team, we will set fire to the club's office and have a campfire on the pitch at Emirates Stadium.’]

While Park Minho was laid-back in his thoughts, Arsenal was continuously thinking about keeping him at the club for a long time.

They had no choice.

Since Thierry Henry and Robin van Persie, Arsenal hadn't had a striker with such tremendous scoring ability for a long time.

Olivier Giroud and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang also performed well as main strikers, but compared to the two aforementioned players, they fell a bit short.

Even the Arsenal board, which often gave harsh evaluations to players over thirty, was determined to keep Park Minho at Arsenal for a long time this time.

Therefore, they planned to renew his contract early, and positive words were also coming from Park Minho's side.

The problem was that despite Arsenal offering a large sum, other clubs' greedy eyes were still fixed on Park Minho.

"F***ing Madrid bastards."

"Hala Madrid? F*** Madrid."

"Why are those PSG guys after our Minho when they've got Haaland?"

"Greedy bastards."

Arsenal officials openly cursed the two teams in front of Jade Kroenke, expressing their loyalty.

Of course, Jade Kroenke was more concerned about how to keep Park Minho at Arsenal for a long time.

He knew that since Park Minho's girlfriend Monica was around, he had a favorable view of Arsenal, but relying solely on that was risky given Park Minho's tremendous stature.

“Isn't there a way... some way.”

Those dumb Spurs managed to keep Junseo Shin until he left for Manchester United to win a championship because the club sacrificed for his military exemption.

If not for that, he would have surely left Tottenham three years ago to win championships.

Arsenal also wanted to create such a sense of obligation... but Park Minho didn't have any specific issues like that.

"Damn! I'm an idiot! I'm a f***ing idiot! I'm a fool! I'm a f***ing moron!"

Listening to the self-deprecating remarks of the operations manager, Jade Kroenke nodded.

"It seems money is the only answer."

Ironically, the same man who criticized PSG and Real Madrid for their financial recklessness concluded that 'more money' was the solution.

His expression turned confident as he reviewed the club's operating funds.

"Arsenal has benefited greatly from Asian market marketing thanks to Minho... It's only right to give back to Minho in proportion. Don't you agree?"

The operations manager nodded in agreement.

It was true that Arsenal's finances had been improving thanks to Park Minho.

"If we win the mini-treble this season and the Champions League next season..."

Why shouldn't he make Park Minho the highest-paid player in the world with all he had?

Though his father was a penny-pincher, he wasn't without money.

Thinking that, Jade Kroenke nodded.

Money was indeed the answer.

* * *

Away games are always tough.

Especially an away game against Brentford, who are sitting in 8th place in the league, feels like hell.

The reason... it's because the point difference is so small between them and Leicester City, who are in 7th place.

If they secure 7th place, they can qualify for the Europa Conference League, which brings significant financial benefits to smaller clubs, so they can't give up.

One can understand why big clubs are so desperate for the Champions League by looking at their finances.

Just qualifying for the Champions League brings in a massive amount of money, which is why everyone is so desperate for it.

"That Manchester United match was rough and tough... I think the Brentford match will feel similar."

I nodded at Lorenzo's words.

He was right.

We had to face a Brentford team highly motivated to secure 7th place, and it was their home ground.

Still, it was much better than the Manchester United match.

Despite being an away game, the opponent was a team close to the bottom in terms of league points conceded, so there was no need to worry.

While their scoring power was quite fierce for a mid-table team, Arsenal's defense, with the addition of Tyrone Tierney, was top-tier in the league, so it shouldn't be a big problem.

Worried about another injury?

Surely... Tyrone Tierney won't get injured again?

Even in a novel, that would be too far-fetched.

* * *

The saying that reality is stranger than fiction did not apply this time.

Fortunately, Tyrone Tierney did not get injured before the match, and nothing unfortunate happened to Arsenal as they prepared for the last game of April.

The cheers of 'The Bees' filled Brentford Community Stadium and could be heard even in the away locker room.

Brentford had been showing quite a good performance, maintaining 8th place in the league this season.

But if you ask whether they are stronger than Manchester United despite their good performance, I can firmly say no.

-Minho passes the ball, and it's a shoooot!

-Gooooooal! Bruno Campos! A fantastic opening goooooooal! Arsenal scores in the 12th minute against Brentford!

You can tell by how I freely connected and coordinated the ball against Brentford.

Brentford's defense had far more gaps than Manchester United's, and they couldn't easily respond to Arsenal's kick and move.

-Arsenal 1 : 0 Brentford

The score difference happened in an instant.

Although it was only a one-goal difference, the Brentford players would feel it was quite significant.

Of course, they played hard and rough, trying to create variables, which was good.

But this one-goal difference would make Brentford players feel heavy-footed.

"They're not as efficient in movement as Manchester United."

Moreover, many Brentford players had already received cards early in the game due to their rough defense.

No player would fail to take advantage of this situation.

Beep!

"Damn!"

A Brentford defender who tackled me cursed in frustration.

All their defenders had now received a card each.

Naturally, they had to play more cautiously.

I was confident that no team in the EPL, except for maybe one, could stop Arsenal's attacking squad with such cautious play.

Liverpool's Kyle Van Dijk might be able to.

In his physical prime with accumulated experience, he displayed monstrous performance.

But Brentford didn't have such a player.

Without one... wouldn't they just have to take a beating?

-Minho's free kick is headed in!

-Gooooooal! Lorenzo Lupo scores with a fantastic header!

-Arsenal is edging closer to the championship! If they win today's match, they will clinch the title!

We scored two goals in the first half.

And as soon as the second half began, I broke through with my individual skills and scored a clinching goal.

As soon as the goal went in, the home fans at Brentford Community Stadium applauded.

It was applause to congratulate Arsenal on winning the championship, and I responded by refraining from celebrating.

Beep! Beep! Beeeep!

As soon as the match ended, coach Alain Levagne ran onto the field with a big smile.

-Arsenal! Arsenal claims the EPL throne for the first time in 20 years since the 03-04 season! Incredible!

-There are still four league matches left to achieve an undefeated championship, but Arsenal has the capability to replicate their historic feat from 20 years ago! Really exciting!

-Coach Alain is hugging Minho! You can see how happy he is.

-Captain Tyrone Tierney is in tears! The Arsenal players are truly joyful.

League Championship.

Arsenal clinched the league title for the first time in 20 years, and the Gunners who followed us to the away game expressed their joy by singing their support songs.

"It's a double! A double!"

"If we win the Europa League and FA Cup, we can lift four trophies this season!"

"F***ing '1,2,3, Arsenal, 5' meme! We'll win all four competitions this season and mock those Spurs bastards! We'll mock them forever until they win the league!"

The Gunners were highly excited.

When I waved at them, they finally came to their senses and started chanting my name.

I was the biggest contributor this season.

When I spread my arms, cheers filled the air.

It truly felt like being a god.

[Arsenal Wins League Title for the First Time in 20 Years!]

[Arsenal Clinches League Title! Can They Also Win the FA Cup and Europa League?]

[41 League Goals! Minho Continues to Break Records!]

[Brentford Loses 3-0 to Arsenal!]

And one more person in London, who was happiest about Arsenal's win, smiled brightly and expressed her joy.

"Champions! Champions! Champions! Champions! Champions!"

Monica hurriedly sat in front of her computer.

She logged onto the Spurs community board and began to troll relentlessly.

[Title: Which team hasn't won the league since the 2010s? LOL]

-It's obviously the dumb Spurs! LOL

-F***er! I'll kill you!

-You f***ing b**tard! Watch out! If I see you on the street, I'll smash your head with a brick!

-Someone please chase this guy out!

-Stupid Spurs LOL Have you ever won the league? Oh... the 60s... when was that again?

-LOL Just the League Cup in 07-08, can't win anything else, fake club level.

-Get lost! F***ing Gunners! Get lost!

Monica laughed heartily, feeling quite refreshed after trolling the Spurs fans.
