## 12. Giant Killing (2)

After my first goal, AS Roma regained control.

AS Roma was indeed a strong team.

Contrary to their earlier clumsy appearance, they fiercely pushed us after conceding a goal.

-Thud! A high-flying ball again!

-AS Roma's build-up is good, but... their finishing is lacking.

-It's disappointing, really disappointing.

-They've missed three opportunities.

As much as our opponents were sluggish,

we also didn't produce any significant attacks after my goal.

Our surprise breakthrough had its limits,

and all our set plays were exposed.

However, thanks to the 1-0 scoreline, our team's expressions were quite bright.

As long as we could somehow maintain it, we'd win.

On the other hand, the AS Roma players showed signs of impatience.

"That's too rough!"

Santiago raised both hands in protest.

But Vittorio, Roma's midfielder who had pushed him down, just shrugged and returned to his position.

Boooooo!

Stop faking it! You piece of shit!

Get up! Is this your bed at home?

Piece of shit!

The home fans' boos poured towards Santiago.

But our sly player leisurely got up and talked to the referee to waste time.

"Ref, if the arm goes higher than this, is it a foul?"

"Yes."

"That guy's arm went just as high..."

"It's a closed case. If you want a yellow card, I'll give it now."

"No, thank you."

At the 43rd minute of the first half,

there were about 2 minutes left until halftime.

Was the grass at Roma's stadium too comfortable?

Two minutes later, Santiago, who was competing with the opposing midfielder, rolled on the field again.

Boooooo!

Boos rained down again.

But our sly player, as if the field was as comfortable as a bed, didn't think of getting up.

Still, noticing the referee's mood, he slowly got up and returned to his position.

Soon, the referee blew the whistle to signal the end of the first half.

The players' expressions were very bright after maintaining the lead from my opening goal.

On the contrary, the AS Roma players' faces looked darker and more anxious than ever.

* * *

"Everyone, sit down."

"It was the worst. Really the worst."

The locker room door opened roughly.

The AS Roma players looked at Coach Martinho with tense expressions as he entered.

"This game isn't that important."

"It's just the third round of the Italian Cup."

"It's true that this match isn't as important as the league. But I can't tolerate this kind of play."

AS Roma is a prestigious club in Serie A.

In this situation, Roma was the top dog.

Parma was the underdog.

The players needed to understand this.

Coach Martinho wanted to convey that point.

"The performance was chaotic."

"Okay! Let's think slowly for a moment."

"Cool your heads. Think about what kind of game we need to play."

"There were many mistakes. Especially the finishing process was terrible in my coaching career."

"I understand you're anxious. The opponent is a team on an unbeaten run in Serie B."

"At the center of that team is a strange Asian player who already has a 20-20 season record."

Coach Martinho made eye contact with the players.

So all the Roma players could see him.

"But you are the wolves of AS Roma."

"Lupi! Wolves! You're wolves!"

"There's nothing more to fear now. We can't play worse than the first half."

"Stay calm. Score."

Hearing those words, the Roma players' eyes changed.

Yes, who were they?

They were the wolves beloved by Roma.

A prestigious club in Serie A.

They were AS Roma players.

"Second, why were you so sluggish in competing with the opposing defenders? And why were the midfielders playing like fools?"

"I like playing rough. There's no place for nice guys in football. But you need to know when and where to do it."

"What do you think happens if you steal in front of the police?"

At Coach Martinho's words, the previously passive attackers and the overly rough midfielders lowered their heads deeply.

"Alright. Remember these two things. First, stay calm and score. Second, act rough only when necessary. Got it?"

The players nodded vigorously at Coach Martinho's words.

"Good! Let's do it!"

"Stay calm! We still have 45 minutes left!"

"Let's turn it around in the second half!"

The AS Roma players, invigorated,

left the locker room with newfound confidence after halftime.

Coach Martinho called the main striker, Hugo Mayoral.

"Hugo."

"Yes, boss."

"Take a long shot if necessary."

"Can I? The defense is thicker than I thought, so there's no space."

Coach Martinho answered Hugo's question.

"You need to make the opponent conscious of the long shots so they come forward. Then you can exploit that space."

"Alright. I'll give it a try."

Hugo Mayoral nodded.

Thus ended halftime.

AS Roma greeted the second half with a different atmosphere.

* * *

It was indeed different from the first half.

Entering the second half, AS Roma showed the traits of a strong Serie A team and took control from the start.

As expected, a coach who has won titles is different.

AS Roma's tactical movements were so different that it was hard to tell if it was the same team from the first half.

Well, it wasn't drastically different.

It just meant it was more troublesome than I thought.

At the same time, I understood how Coach Martinho had lifted multiple trophies.

As the quality of their finishing improved, Giovanni started to struggle.

Twice, moments worthy of Giovanni Buffon's super save highlight reel appeared.

That meant we couldn't easily respond to their attacks as we had thought.

In the first half, despite taking many shots, they couldn't get near Buffon.

What kind of stick did they use in the locker room to change this much in the second half?

Anyway.

We were shaken by their increased activity.

To be precise, our defense was having the toughest time.

Seeing that, the home fans showed their satisfaction with loud cheers.

Waaaaaaah!

Roma! Roma! Roma! Roma!

This is it! Crush those Parma guys!

Hugoooooo!

With cheers came the sound of leather being struck.

Seeing Hugo take a shot from a distance, Giovanni quickly threw himself.

-Another super save by Giovanni!

-Hugo has already taken two long shots, sending chills down Parma's defense.

-Parma! Unlike the first half, they're greatly shaken! They don't even have a chance to counterattack!

Our defense was shaken by Hugo Mayoral's couple of long shots.

I had a bad feeling.

Strangely, that ominous feeling quickly became reality.

This time, Roma's attack started from Hugo's foot.

As soon as the ball reached him,

one of our defenders rushed in.

As a Roma player penetrated the gap, Hugo faked a long shot and delivered a low, fast through-pass.

-To Tommaso! A through-pass from Tommaso!

-But shoot!

-Giovanni saves it! Giovanni Buffon!

Giovanni, who rushed out, blocked Tommaso's shot that came from the through-pass.

But he couldn't secure the second ball.

In the chaotic situation, the player who grabbed the second ball was Hugo Mayoral, who had been showing sharp shots.

Thud!

Slap!

At the 14th minute of the second half,

AS Roma scored the equalizer.

-Hugoooooo Mayoral! AS Roma ties the game with a goal from Hugo Mayoral! The score is now 1-1, and the game is wide open!

Waaaaaaah!

Who's the wolf who scored?

Hugooooooo!

Mayoralllllll!

The home fans' thunderous cheers filled the field.

The Parma players had grim expressions.

They didn't look happy.

But there was still time left.

It wasn't time to give up yet.

With about 30 minutes left in the game,

I started to conserve my energy little by little.

As time passed, Coach Martinho's Roma would gradually drain their stamina.

I planned to exploit that part.

* * *

Roma is a formidable team.

They were currently third in Serie A.

If they maintained this position, they'd secure a spot in the Champions League.

So, there were concerns.

What if we were completely outclassed?

We might have to give up the game altogether.

But playing the game, our team was quite strong.

We were holding a 1-1 score against a strong Serie A team competing for a Champions League spot.

Of course, in terms of performance, we were largely outmatched.

But the gap wasn't as big as I thought.

If we could defend well and score one,

I thought we might have a chance.

I glanced at Coach Martinho.

Even at 1-1, he seemed busy.

He seemed like a coach who was never satisfied.

I remembered how passionately he encouraged his team during his Tottenham days.

He's a great coach.

There's a reason he's a renowned manager.

But I was itching to see Coach Martinho's face crumple.

It was now over 35 minutes into the second half.

I had rested long enough.

My knees might rust at this rate.

So, let's use my knees a bit.

"Mino!"

I heard Franco's shout.

I dropped back to the halfway line to receive the ball.

The ball connected precisely to my feet.

At the same time, I pushed the ball and increased my speed.

As I dribbled the ball, I noticed AS Roma's players tense up.

-Mino! He grabs the ball and charges forward!

-All the AS Roma players are wary of Mino! That shows how great his previous goal was!

After evading one player with a step-over, I turned to the side, and the opponent hurried to follow.

Franco and Santiago were running centrally.

There were five defenders.

Including me, we had three.

Even considering Marjan, who was trailing, we were one short, so I had to beat one with my skills.

-Mino breaks through AS Roma's left side!

-Mino! He lightly evades Costanza with a back shot! He's breaking into the half-space he loves!

-It's the Mino zone!

This was my chance to shoot directly.

Should I curl it?

Or an outside-of-the-foot cross?

There were many options.

Then,

the opponent nervously watched my left foot.

Curling it might be hard then.

With that thought, I struck the ball hard with the outside of my right foot.

Seeing the ball curve like a banana, I was confident.

At least an assist.

But the ball curved more than expected.

The goalkeeper hurriedly dived.

But the ball went straight into the top corner of the goal.

Thud!

Did that just go in?

I was a bit bewildered.

But the surrounding reactions were intense.

-Gooooooal! Minooooo! An outside-of-the-foot kick with his right foot goes straight in!

-One of the two patterns Mino shows from the Mino zone! One is curling with the left foot, and the other is this outside-of-the-foot kick with the right foot!

-It's the outside-of-the-foot kick frequently shown by Quaresma, known as the 'Trivela'!

I ran.

And slid to prevent my knees from rusting.

But feeling something was off, I looked up to see the home fans glaring at me with menacing eyes.

They hurled insults and boos.

Wait... wasn't this the away section?

Fearing for my life, I quickly got up.

And ran to celebrate with the players congratulating my goal.

It was the scariest moment of my life.

"You crazy bastard! Crazy bastard!"

"You really scored!"

"Hahahaha! Minooooo!"

In the distance, a Korean flag fluttered.

Seeing the flag wave rapidly after my outside-of-the-foot shot, I wondered if someday a 'Park Minho Special' video would circulate in Korea like Quaresma's.

On my way back to my position, Coach Martinho stared at me blankly, so I gave him a wink.

It seemed we had AS Roma in the bag.

With about 10 minutes left.

We had enough capability to fend off their attacks.

As I thought, the remaining 10 minutes were an all-out offensive by AS Roma.

But our defense held on tenaciously.

Even the prince syndrome Lautaro threw himself twice to block shots with his body.

Soon, the referee's whistle blew.

Tweet! Tweet! Tweeet!

I could finally relax.

We had beaten the strong Serie A team, AS Roma.

Coach Alain Levagne clenched his fist.

Santiago, with a bright smile, celebrated the victory.

Hugo Mayoral of Roma hung his head, tormenting the innocent grass.

Lastly, Coach José Martinho approached and offered his hand.

"Good game."

Only after shaking hands with him did the victory truly sink in.

But who would our next opponent be in the Italian Cup?

I hoped it wouldn't be another strong Serie A team.

[Parma Calcio! Creates a huge upset!]

[Comments]

-Crazyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Park Minho is this kind of character?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-When he slid and smiled at the home fans, I was blown awayㅋㅋ Then he quickly got up, probably because he got scaredㅋㅋㅋ

-Haha, if you don't want to die, you gotta get upㅋㅋㅋ

-Wow... is it real that he winked at Coach Martinho?

-He's got real guts. Celebrating like that amid the boos of the home fans and even winking? That's just insane.

-This guy fits Manchester United.

-Why bring Man U here suddenly?

-I think he'd fit better in Liverpool.

-Nope, our Minho is a Parma lifer.

After the game, the news quickly reached Korea.

We had beaten AS Roma 2-1.

We had achieved a giant killing.

But there was no time to revel in the victory.

There were still many games left.

And our next opponent was already decided.

I didn't expect to use this phrase again.

The saying, "Words become seeds."

[Italian Cup fourth round draw announced! Parma Calcio's next opponent is Serie A champion Inter!]

In the fourth round of the Italian Cup,

our opponent was the defending Serie A champion.

F.C. Internazionale.

Yes, it was 'Inter.'
