## 50. Idol (2)

The friendly match ended with a score of 7 to 3.

I wasn't in a bad mood because the result of working hard to adapt to the new tactics was pretty good.

More than that, Félix Magno, the ace of New York City, came over with sparkling eyes holding a uniform.

When he asked to exchange uniforms, I handed him mine, and he smiled brightly in delight.

Well... I also gave him some words of encouragement.

I told him that his skills were good enough to play in a big league someday.

Of course, this guy smiled broadly.

[Félix Magno, 'Minho is a god. I want to join the EPL someday and play on the same field as him.']

[Félix Magno, 'My idol is Minho!']

As soon as the friendly match ended, he gave such an interview.

It seemed like he thought of me as his idol.

Talking about idols made me think of the player I set as my goal when I started playing soccer.

Of course, all I saw were YouTube videos, but I can proudly say he was one of the top 3 players in his prime.

Though, it's a pity that his prime was a bit short.

Still, I learned a lot from his movements.

Anyway.

A few days after winning against New York City.

We continued our good streak by winning the next match against New York Cosmos with a score of 8 to 2.

In this match as well, some players looked at me with burdensome eyes, and after the match, seeing them run towards me holding uniforms was a bit startling.

"Minho! I respect you!"

"Someday, I want to be like you, Minho!"

"I hope you win the Ballon d'Or this year!"

These guys, like Félix Magno, looked at me with admiration and asked various soccer-related questions.

Thanks to that, after the match, I made time to have dinner with them and build a friendship.

"World stars sure are different."

Lorenzo gave me a thumbs-up as he watched me.

I don't know what he meant by it though.

Arsenal's US tour was smooth.

Facing teams like New York Red Bulls, Philadelphia Union, etc.,

We were able to refine new tactics continuously in matches against teams from Major League Soccer.

After the US tour.

Returning to London, Arsenal called Castellón from Spain's third division for a final check-up.

This meant the end of July and that the first match of August, the Charity Shield, was waiting.

Since 2002, it has been renamed the FA Community Shield, and our opponent was Liverpool, who finished second in the league last season.

"Our opponent is Liverpool."

"They're a tough team, and now they've added the Portuguese ace, Manuel Félix."

"They will strongly press us on the right side, making it hard for us to maintain possession."

"Never exceed three touches. Keep possession short and move the ball forward quickly."

"Those who show good performance in this Community Shield will be actively used in the European Super Cup."

As soon as we entered the locker room, our coach instructed us to attack aggressively.

He wanted us to keep possession as short as possible and move the ball forward quickly.

It seemed he wanted to see how we would handle Liverpool's characteristic strong pressure.

Entering the field, I saw the Liverpool players after a long time.

The player who caught my eye was Manuel Félix, who transferred to Liverpool for a huge fee from Atlético Madrid.

It was hard not to notice him.

It seemed he would start on the bench today, as Liverpool hadn't fully sorted out their attacking lineup yet.

Liverpool fielded a 4-3-3 formation with Kasan Vlahovic, Mane, and Salah at the forefront.

I also sat on the bench and watched the field.

Today's match was a preliminary skirmish, but it was also the last chance to check the players' abilities and tactics.

*Whistle*

The first half of the FA Community Shield began with the referee's whistle.

* * *

Woooaaahhhh!

Raising the trophy high.

Liverpool players smiled brightly.

The scoreboard showed a score of 2 to 2.

I took in the sight of Jules Kaembe lowering his head as the last penalty taker.

Liverpool was indeed a tough team.

Throughout the first half, we tried not to hold onto the ball for too long due to their strong offensive play, but we made frequent mistakes due to Liverpool's organized movements.

Still, with good performances from Lorenzo and Magalhães, we scored goals from set pieces to equalize.

According to the Community Shield's rule of going straight to penalties without extra time, the penalty shootout began.

Due to Jules Kaembe's mistake as the last kicker, Liverpool became the winners of this Community Shield.

Despite the loss, our coach nodded with a satisfied expression.

It seemed he had identified the issues with our tactics during the match against Liverpool.

Looking at the detailed tactical changes from the day after the Community Shield match, it was clear that our coach had gotten a grasp of something from this match.

And then came the day of the European Super Cup.

This time, Liverpool pressed us with the trio of Vlahovic, Mane, and Sané.

But unlike the Community Shield, Arsenal managed to handle Liverpool's strong pressure well in the European Super Cup and took the initiative.

"Spread out wider to the flanks! Make the opponent take 2 or 3 more steps to press!"

We widened the gap between players extremely.

Thanks to this, Liverpool had to run more than usual to press Arsenal.

Of course, this temporary measure had its pros and cons.

The advantage was that it quickly tired the opponent and allowed us to use players with accurate long passes to make Liverpool's defense look foolish.

Thanks to this, by the 20th minute of the first half, Arsenal was leading 2 to 1, maintaining high possession unlike in the Community Shield.

The downside was, of course, that if the wide gaps and long passes failed, we were vulnerable to the opponent's counterattacks.

Whenever a long pass to the flanks failed, Liverpool used the wide gaps in Arsenal's formation to exchange short passes.

We were helpless against Liverpool's short passing movements, leading to several dangerous moments.

Naturally, these led to conceding goals.

By the end of the second half, the score was the same as in the Community Shield, 2 to 2.

But in the last extra time of the second half.

The difference between the Community Shield and this European Super Cup was that I had been on the field for a long time.

-Minho! He swiftly bypasses Tuna Sole!

-Kyle van Dijk! He quickly stretches his foot towards Minho, but Minho cuts inside and shoots!

-Gooooooooooal! Minhoooooo! He scores an incredible goal in the extra time of the second half!

-The score is complete! Arsenal takes the lead 3 to 2 again! Liverpool is in a hurry!

-It was a finish that essentially ended the game!

My first goal of the season.

As soon as I scored, I ran to the broadcast camera and made a hand heart for Monika.

After my celebration ended and the game resumed.

Liverpool hurriedly kicked the ball to Arsenal's territory, but it wasn't easy to break through Arsenal's defense, which had quickly narrowed the gaps.

*Whistle* *Whistle* *Whistle*

-The game is over!

-Arsenal becomes the owner of the European Super Cup!

-What an exciting match! With the excellent performances of both teams, the EPL opening match in 4 days is highly anticipated.

The first trophy of the season.

As I lifted the European Super Cup, I thought.

At the very least, let's lift the Champions League trophy, the 'Big Ear.'

"Minho! Come quickly! Let's take a photo!"

Well... Shall I enjoy it for now?

After all, a victory is a victory.

* * *

[Arsenal avenges their Community Shield defeat!]

[European Super Cup winners: Arsenal!]

[Arsenal beats Liverpool 3 to 2! The thrilling comeback hero is 'Arsenal's god,' Minho!]

[Jürgen Klopp, 'This season is promising. Arsenal will definitely stand out in the Champions League.']

[Alain Levagne, 'It was a tough match. We kept adjusting our tactics against Liverpool. We'll show a different side in the EPL opening match.']

[European Super Cup MoM is Minho!]

-Great! We're off to a good start this season!

-Minhoooooooo!

-We lifted the first trophy of the season!

-I look forward to our performance in the Champions League. Let's aim for at least the semi-finals this season!

-Winning would be nice too.

-Hehehe! Perfect! Absolutely perfect!

-But who is our opponent for the opening match?

-You idiot! Don't you know?

-Who is it?

-Our opponent for the opening match is the same as last season.

-Oh? Then... our opponent is?

-Yeah! Those stupid 'Man U' guys.

As soon as Arsenal lifted the European Super Cup trophy, they briefly stopped in London and then headed straight to Manchester.

Arsenal's EPL opening match opponent was the same as last season's opening match, 'Manchester United.'

"Facing Man U for the league opener..."

"And it's an away game."

"Be grateful it's not an away game against Liverpool."

"That's true."

On the club bus heading to Manchester.

The players were passing the time talking about their opening match opponent, Man U.

"Besides, this manager has been around for quite a while."

"That's a bit surprising."

Unlike previous seasons when Man U kept changing managers, they retained Helge as the manager this season too.

With Ronaldo retiring this season, many experts evaluated that the era of Messi and Ronaldo had come to an end.

They showed great interest in the players who would lead the next era after Messi and Ronaldo.

Of course, Park Minho was the most prominent player leading the new era.

Following him were players like Achess Party, Mbappe, Haaland, Vinicius Junior, and Jamie Dine.

And this EPL opening match attracted a lot of attention from soccer fans as it was a showdown between Park Minho and Achess Party, who were expected to lead the new era.

[Achess Party, 'The player I respect? I respect Minho the most, who I'll face in the opening match!']

[Achess Party, 'I want to show who I am in front of Minho.']

[Achess Party, 'He is my idol.']

And.

Achess Party, the young prospect Man U acquired for a huge fee.

He drew attention with interviews leading up to the opening match.

August 17th.

Finally, the day of the EPL opening match arrived.

* * *

Achess Party thought.

What if his peer Ansu Fati had benchmarked Park Minho, who is called Arsenal's god?

Such a thought.

"He's an incredible player."

Although it was only slightly revealed through various media, Achess Party knew that the reason Park Minho finished the season without a single injury in the rough EPL was due to his training routine.

"The important thing is stamina."

Achess Party knew that whenever Park Minho appeared in the media, he focused on building stamina.

"With a similar physique to mine, he withstood the rough defenses of the EPL and Serie A better than anyone else."

Like his peer Ansu Fati, Achess Party was also called fragile and failed to be promoted to Barcelona's first team.

In his despair, Park Minho's training methods seemed worth considering.

He didn't give up and followed Park Minho's training methods and lifestyle patterns, which were revealed in various media and interviews while he was dominating Serie A.

The result was seen in his stats and the number of matches he played last season.

And in the weekly wage and transfer fee he received when he moved to Man U.

He accumulated an impressive 17 goals and 21 assists in 48 matches, leaving Barcelona with a huge transfer fee and transferring to Man U.

Honestly, if the prodigy Jamie Dine hadn't appeared in the same position, he might have stayed at Barcelona and inherited Messi's number 10 jersey.

Anyway, Achess Party was looking forward to the EPL opener.

Although he was on a different team from his idol.

In this match, he wanted to show Park Minho who he was.

Man U players arrived in front of the tunnel first.

Achess Party swallowed his saliva, waiting for his idol, and a minute later, Arsenal lined up next to Man U players to enter the field.

And Achess could see.

The player with jersey number 10, Park Minho.

Sparkling.

His eyes shone brightly.

"It's time to enter."

Then.

As the club official's words signaled the entry, Achess Party clenched his fist among the players of the two teams entering the field.

Today's match.

He vowed to show his best performance.
