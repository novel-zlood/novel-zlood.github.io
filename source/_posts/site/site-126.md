## 47. Smooth Sailing (3)

It's true that the fact that four main players were absent had a significant impact on Arsenal's performance.

Otherwise, West Ham wouldn't have been able to push up their line and play so aggressively.

Thanks to that, the match has both teams' players running like crazy as if they had never been passive.

Counterattack, another counterattack, continuous counterattacks.

Both West Ham and Arsenal players showed signs of fatigue from the fast-paced transitions between offense and defense.

Even though only half of the first half had passed, the players from both teams were gasping for breath, running again and again.

Of course, West Ham's players were panting more heavily than Arsenal's.

The fast tempo and the forward pressing made them feel exhausted several times faster than usual.

"Focus! Don't miss a single player! Why are you allowing them to break through there? Huh?"

Coach Alain Levagne's shout echoed across the field.

Arsenal's defense moved quickly.

As expected, West Ham's ace was none other than Jarrod Bowen, and even though his play was quite predictable, Arsenal's flank was still left wide open.

-Jarrod Bowen! Shooooooots from outside the penalty box! Goooooooal!

-Jarrod Bowen scores in the 30th minute of the first half! West Ham leads again, 2-1!

-Incredible! Truly incredible!

Lacking a bit of creativity.

But aside from that, Jarrod Bowen is an outstanding winger.

Even though his plays were predictable, Takehiro Tomiyasu couldn't stop him properly.

In Korea, they even called him a budget version of Robben, but he still managed to score with those predictable moves.

West Ham was leading by one point again.

But they couldn't afford to relax.

As soon as Park Minho got the ball, Arsenal's counterattack started to press West Ham's defense again.

"Press him hard so Minho can't advance further!"

Recalling the scene where Park Minho kept the ball among three West Ham players, Coach David Butler shouted, veins popping in his neck.

"Press him hard! Stop him with a foul if necessary!"

Despite the shouts, West Ham couldn't stop Park Minho from advancing the ball to the danger zone.

If they lost today's match, it would be difficult to expect an easy game against Arsenal in the first leg of the Europa League quarterfinals in five days.

Coach David Butler loosened his tie roughly and called for the tactical coach sitting on the bench.

"We need a way to stop Minho at all costs."

"If that were possible, would I be at West Ham? I'd be coaching at Real Madrid or PSG."

"Fxxk! I can't argue with that!"

Woouu!

Watching Arsenal's sharp shot anxiously, Coach David Butler ran his hand through his hair.

To win, they not only had to mark Arsenal's widely spread attack but also Park Minho, who always broke through at least one player when he got the ball.

"I hoped Minho wouldn't be in good form…."

But just by looking at his touches, it was clear that he was in much better form than usual.

The only reason West Ham was ahead was because Arsenal's defense was more shaky than usual.

"Moreover, the midfield's influence is much weaker than in other games…."

If not today, when would they ever beat Arsenal?

But contrary to Coach David Butler's expectations, Arsenal managed to equalize again with a goal from Kasper Nielsen just before the end of the first half.

[Arsenal 2: 2 West Ham]

It was a perfect mid-range shot targeting the empty space created by the excessive marking on Park Minho.

Soon, the referee blew the whistle.

Coach David Butler rushed to the locker room with a worried expression as soon as the first half ended.

* * *

It's a tough game.

But it didn't feel like we were going to lose.

Despite West Ham's better-than-expected performance and our shaky defense and midfield, we managed to finish the first half at 2-2.

I'm satisfied with just that.

Honestly, I expected a two-point difference.

Starting the second half with a tie is good enough.

Knowing this, our coach only gave brief feedback for the second half to help the players stay focused.

And so, the second half began.

I asked Bruno for the ball after we won it.

"Give me the ball."

Thud!

As soon as the ball connected with my foot, I lightly bypassed Sander Langrand and started to speed up.

As I ran fast, West Ham's players hurriedly moved back to block my movement.

-Minho! He's dribbling the ball up quickly!

-His speed is increasing!

"Block him! Block him! If he gets past one more, there will be empty space behind!"

Hearing Coach David Butler's shout, West Ham's defender Kurt Baumann lunged desperately.

Nope, I'm not losing the ball to a cat-abusing fool.

-Minho! Minho! Minho! He makes Kurt Baumann look like a fool with a Marseille turn!

-There's open space ahead! Only Oscar Arias stands between him and goalkeeper Denker Parines!

The only player left was Oscar Arias.

After bypassing him with a step-over, I faced the goalkeeper one-on-one.

I felt a slight pull from behind as Oscar grabbed my uniform.

Of course, it wasn't a problem.

I've often scored in such situations.

Boom!

With the sound of leather being struck hard, the ball deflected off Denker Parines' hand.

But it didn't head outside the goal.

The shot was so powerful that the ball shook the net.

-Gooooooal!

-Minhoooooo! Arsenal takes the lead! Minho shakes West Ham's net!

-Minho dribbled nearly 40 meters on his own!

-Amazing! Truly amazing!

-Minho scores his 38th league goal of the season!

-Minho keeps breaking the record for most goals in a single season!

As soon as the ball went in, I ran towards the crowd and spread my arms, making the Gunners look at me with ecstatic expressions, letting out strange noises.

Woooooaaaaaah!

Minoooooooooo!

There were so many Gunners screaming like pterosaurs, reminding me of Monika.

"I think Arsenal is a team of dinosaurs."

"What do you mean?"

"That kid rampages like a raptor, that guy roars like a T-Rex, and my girlfriend screams like a pterosaur."

"What?"

It's okay if you don't understand.

Just know that dinosaurs are cool.

Thinking such a bizarre thought all of a sudden... Have I completely become one with Arsenal?

I don't know.

I really don't know.

* * *

As Arsenal took the lead 3-2, Coach Alain Levagne clenched his fist and shouted.

"Ahhh! This is the player called 'Minho.'"

He wanted to inform the foolish opposing coach.

To let him know that Arsenal has Park Minho.

Glancing to the side, he saw Coach David Butler trembling in the technical area.

Coach Alain Levagne chuckled inwardly.

"Ah... Where can I find another player like Minho?"

Having two players like Minho, who can destroy the opponent's flanks from both sides... just the thought of it was thrilling.

In reality, it's hard enough to bring in a player like Lorenzo, let alone another Park Minho.

That's why he was so pleased.

He was very satisfied with Arsenal's overwhelming attacking lineup centered around Park Minho.

"But I can't be satisfied with just this."

There was no backup for Lorenzo, and he didn't plan to keep using Park Minho on the flanks.

Tactically, he believed the best position for Park Minho to shine was in the central attacking midfield.

So, he planned to change tactics next season.

He would likely let go of some players in the summer and bring in the players he had in mind.

"Good… Everything's going smoothly."

Like the season plan unfolding smoothly.

As the second half progressed, Arsenal's performance also began to stabilize.

Just as Coach Alain Levagne said, everything was going smoothly.

Park Minho advanced slowly after receiving the ball.

As soon as he got the ball, Arsenal's attackers started targeting West Ham's defensive gaps fiercely.

Players moved around, looking for space.

Conversely, West Ham's players tried to maintain their line through constant communication.

Wham!

Park Minho kicked the ball hard.

The player who received his long pass was the league's fastest, Jules Kaembe.

-Jules Kaembe! He's breaking through with the ball!

-He's incredibly fast! Watching him run with the ball always reminds me of a cheetah.

Jules Kaembe, who quickly tore through the opponent's flank, sent in a cross.

It was a slightly long cross, but perfect for Lorenzo Lupo at the front.

-Lorenzoooooo!

-He heads it but Denker Parines makes a save! West Ham survives the crisis!

While everyone marveled at Denker Parines' save,

Park Minho, whom Coach Alain Levagne trusted the most, was rushing to the spot where the second ball was falling.

-Oh! Minho! Minhooooooo!

-Gooooooal! Minho finishes it off! Arsenal leads 4-2!

Denker Parines sat down with a dejected expression.

And Park Minho, who scored, clenched his fist and ran back towards the corner flag.

With more than half of the second half gone, the game's result was starting to become clear.

* * *

[Arsenal remains unbeaten with 28 wins, 3 draws, and 0 losses!]

[4-2 victory! Arsenal wins with Minho's 2 goals and 1 assist! One step closer to an unbeaten season!]

[Arsenal and West Ham face off in the league before their Europa League quarterfinal clash in five days!]

[Can the two teams produce a different result in London Stadium?]

[Coach David Butler: "We will make sure to beat Arsenal in the Europa League quarterfinal first leg."]

[Coach Alain Levagne: "We plan to stay focused until the end of the season. We are a team worthy of being champions!"]

-Wow! Minooooooo!

-As expected! Arsenal has only Minho.

-I was worried because the opponent's flanks were pressing hard today... but Minho solved everything.

-Only 7 games left for an unbeaten league title.

-Just win 2 more games and the title is ours. As long as we don't lose the remaining 7 games... it's an unbeaten title!

-I can't believe it... Arsenal winning the league? The first league title since the 03-04 season?

-lolololololololololol League titleeeee! Arsenal winning the leaguueee!

Winning the first game of April finally relieved the fans' anxiety.

Now, if they win just 2 of the remaining 7 games, the league title would be secured, allowing the Gunners to finally breathe a sigh of relief.

Moreover, with consistent performances in the FA Cup and Europa League, the Gunners were cautiously hoping for a mini-treble.

"Mini-treble! We want a mini-treble!"

As soon as I got home, I was met with Monika's crazed eyes, showing just how high the Gunners' expectations were.

And in the Europa League quarterfinal first leg,

Thanks to my opening goal, we won 3-1, producing a positive result for advancing to the semifinals.

Arsenal's situation was moving smoothly.

But it didn't feel entirely smooth.

[Jules Kaembe injured! Arsenal now has 5 injured main players!]

[Losing an important wing player at a crucial time! Can Arsenal really achieve an unbeaten season?]

Jules Kaembe was out due to injury.

The next opponent was Southampton, who had climbed to 5th place in the league.

With 5 main players out, we had to face Southampton, who was on a roll.

Forget about being smooth… We're screwed.
