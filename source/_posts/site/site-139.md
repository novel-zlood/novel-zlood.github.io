## 50. Idol (3)

Man U is a good team.

Even after Ronaldo retired, they have a slew of excellent strikers who can support the team.

Moreover, they have a manager with tactical abilities that are not significantly lacking compared to other great managers in the EPL, a solid midfield, and a decent defense.

All these aspects make Man U a strong team.

If we don't call this team strong, then the only teams that could be called strong in the EPL are Arsenal and Liverpool.

Anyways.

The reason why Man U is being criticized by fans recently, despite being strong in all aspects.

It's because of the board that seems to shake things up as if it doesn't matter what happens to the manager and players, and the current situation of continuously missing out on victories.

Honestly, fans wouldn't be too dissatisfied if they just win, even if the board is a mess and the squad is somewhat lacking.

So what Man U needs right now is victory, and they would want 'winning' more than anyone else.

Besides, since I made my professional debut and started my fourth season, Man U has only lifted the league trophy once.

They must be thirsty for victory.

Especially the trophy they thirst for the most would be the Champions League trophy, the 'Big Ear'.

Last season, despite Ronaldo's 'Last Dance', Man U had to end their Champions League run with a poor performance, getting knocked out in the quarterfinals, so they must be even thirstier.

That might be why the board is so desperate to bring in top-class strikers.

"Let's win the opening match and head back to London happily."

Everyone nodded at Tierney's words.

Achess Party, who shook hands with me earlier, looked at me with sparkling eyes.

That guy must really think of me as an idol.

I play football quite well, but I haven't built a great career like Messi or other legends yet, so I didn't expect to have fans like him.

Tweet!

The first half started with the referee's whistle.

The front three consisting of Shin Junseo, Achess Party, and Andrew Rashford moved quickly.

After Ronaldo retired, the player at the forefront was surprisingly Junseo hyung.

Maybe it's because he had experience playing as a lone striker when he was with Tottenham, but he was showing quite good movement in that position.

It felt like Man U had succeeded in making a proper big signing this time.

As soon as he got the ball, Achess Party displayed his abilities, shaking Arsenal's defense.

- Achess Party shows why this match is the most anticipated of the first round! Achess is sprinting at an incredible speed!

- Achess! He's fast! He bypasses Tierney in an instant and crosses the ball.

- Mario Fernandes stretches his foot, but Ramsdale catches the ball, ending Man U's counterattack.

I can see why he's considered a future world-class player to lead the next generation.

"His movements are completely different."

He's the same age as Jules Kambembe.

A striker equipped with physicality, skills, and mentality.

This time, it seems Man U's hefty investment might not be in vain.

Waaaaaaah!

The cheers of the home fans filled the field.

They must have realized it too.

This signing by Man U is a success.

But that doesn't mean Man U will win.

After all, football is a game played by 11 players.

The reason the score is still 0-0 is that the ball hasn't been properly connected to me yet.

"Mino!"

As soon as the ball connected to me, Theo Wan-Bissaka rushed to block me.

A player with really good defensive skills.

But not particularly strong in other areas.

It wasn't difficult to bypass him.

More than that, the players' movements seemed more advanced today.

Much better than last season.

This is why players need to experience winning.

- Bruno connects Mino's pass to the center! Lorenzo grabs the ball and charges forward.

- The passes feel much more organic than last season. It's like watching a more advanced form of Wengerball! Mino receives the ball again!

- Mino doesn't get pushed back even in a body fight with James Maguire and drives the ball forward!

Though he's slow.

His body fighting skills are really top-notch.

When I clashed with him last season, it felt like a real traffic accident, but this season is probably going to be very different.

Persistently.

As I pushed through the opponent's body fight and charged into the danger area, Maguire's expression hardened.

- Mino charges deep into the danger area! It's definitely a precarious situation.... Mino! He doesn't get pushed back!

- Amazing! Mino! He finally pushes James Maguire away! And Mino cuts inside right away!

- Once! Twice! Mino! He fools Raphael Varane with a cut and shoots!

- Gooooooal!

- Minooooooo! Incredible play! Mino's super play comes out in the 18th minute of the first half!

I think it was really good to learn yoga for a bit of bulk-up and body flexibility this preseason.

- James Maguire looks blankly at Mino's back! Truly a nightmare for defenders! That's Mino!

I lightly shared the joy of scoring the first goal with the players and returned to my position to restart the match.

Scoring the first goal always feels good.

It felt great to be the first scorer for Arsenal's league this season.

Our manager suddenly punched the air and jumped around, getting a warning from the referee.

Why did he punch the air?

Our manager is quite a peculiar person.

* * *

It's just one out of 38 matches.

Thinking that way would be really comforting, but...

The story changes if that one match is the opening match.

As the saying goes, 'the start is half of the battle.'

Winning the opening match is really important.

Even when Man U had the 'slow starter' trait under Sir Alex Ferguson's management.

They rarely allowed a defeat in the opening match.

That's how important the opening match is, and losing this match could have a small impact on the remaining 37 matches.

Knowing this, manager Helge encouraged the players.

To focus a bit more and catch up to a tie.

To win the opening match at home and make the fans happy.

But Man U's attacking line couldn't easily create a goal.

Specifically, Derrick De Jong was fighting a lonely battle in the midfield.

Maybe because Paul Pogba and Mario Fernandes weren't players who were good at defensive contributions, they couldn't overcome Arsenal's persistent pressing and possession.

Maintaining 40% possession in the midfield itself felt like a miracle.

Man U's midfield started and ended with Derrick De Jong.

That much reliance was placed on Derrick De Jong.

Even under such pressure, Derrick De Jong created chances with chillingly good passes.

- Achess Party! He catches the pass from Derrick De Jong and shoots!

- Gooooooal! Achess Party! Man U's first league goal is by Achess Party!

- The match is back to square one!

"Achessssss!"

"Uaaaah! Glory! Glory Man-United!"

"Nice! This is it!"

The huge cheers from the home fans.

Achess Party slid across the field celebrating his equalizing goal.

Even manager Helge, who had shown discomfort after conceding the first goal, clenched his fist in joy seeing Achess's goal.

But the overall flow of the game favored Arsenal.

Despite conceding the equalizer, Arsenal's defense didn't shake much.

Manager Helge had no choice but to shout to his attackers to actively contribute to the defense.

It was an inevitable choice due to the power struggle in the midfield, and at the same time, he started preparing McTominay early while cursing Man U's incompetent board.

'I've asked so much to sign central defenders and holding midfielders!'

Of course, Achess Party and Rodrigo Santos were not unnecessary assets.

With the addition of these two players, more diverse attacking routes were completed for Man U.

But the urgent need was for central defenders and midfielders, so manager Helge couldn't be entirely happy.

"Is it Mino again?"

Manager Helge sighed.

Unlike Man U, who struggled to score with the connection between Derrick De Jong and Achess Party, Arsenal easily broke through Man U's defense and scored the second goal.

The scorer again was Park Minho.

- Minoooooo!

Sliiiide!

Park Minho slid across the field and tapped the Arsenal emblem.

Arsenal's away fans chanted Park Minho's name, cheering for his goal.

Just like last season, Park Minho scored so easily at critical moments this season as well.

That fact hit manager Helge hard.

- Arsenal takes the lead again! Arsenal regains the lead with Mino's second goal.

- He scores so easily. Man U's players must find Mino annoying. He plays so effortlessly.

Derrick De Jong encouraged the players.

Man U continued to shake Arsenal's defense with counterattacks utilizing Achess Party.

Achess Party not only scored goals but also had excellent passing skills, creating good opportunities for Shin Junseo and Andrew Rashford.

The problem was, Shin Junseo wasn't a player well-suited for the forefront, so he was gradually being blocked by the opponent's pressure.

Andrew Rashford, on the other hand, still hadn't improved his poor football intelligence and his ability to build up in set-play situations was at a hopeless level.

Ultimately, they had to rely on Achess Party.

Manager Helge started preparing Jadon Sancho quickly for the second half.

Thud!

With Lorenzo Lupo's goal at the end of the first half, the score widened to 3-1.

Seeing Man U's unchanged performance from last season, the home fans expressed their disappointment with boos.

Booooo!

Achess Party, entering the locker room at the end of the first half, looked at Park Minho, feeling the difficulty of the match.

Still, the reason he could endure the current situation was because he was on the same field as his idol.

"I wish I could score one more goal..."

Achess Party smiled, resolving to score one more goal in the second half, and headed to the locker room.

Unlike the exhausted Man U players, he still looked quite energetic.

* * *

As soon as the second half started, Man U launched a surprise offensive.

Seeing that they replaced Pogba and Rashford with McTominay and Jadon Sancho, it seemed like Man U's manager knew how to read the flow.

Man U's attacks were quite sharp, unlike the first half.

The substitute players showed good form, pressing us.

Of course, it wasn't a big problem.

Despite gaining momentum, they didn't score a goal.

At the same time, as soon as their attack was cut off, we had a good chance to counterattack.

"Minooooo!"

Jake Francis called my name.

The long pass from his foot connected to mine.

At the same time, Arsenal's counterattack began.

I had no intention of missing the opportunity created by the defense.

Accelerating quickly, I ran down the field.

My smooth touch with the ball made Man U's defense panic and retreat.

Especially the slow-footed James Maguire, who hurriedly backed off like a panicked colt.

But I was confident it was already too late.

Yes, wouldn't a hat-trick be expected in the opening match?

Just like catching soft tofu, I lightly touched the ball to bypass McTominay, and with a slight upper body feint in front of Raphael Varane, he slipped.

At the same time, I quickly took a shooting stance to prevent the opposing goalkeeper, Danny Henderson, from reacting and swung my left foot, striking the ball hard.

Thunk!

The sound of leather being struck was heard.

Thud!

The sound of my shot hitting the net followed.

- Minoooooooo! Hat-trick! Hat-trick! Mino records a hat-trick against Man U in the opening match! And at Old Trafford, no less!

- Mino! Truly amazing! He boasts tremendous scoring ability this season too! Arsenal leads 4-1 with overwhelming performance!

Cutting through the screaming home fans, I kissed the Arsenal emblem on the broadcast camera for Monica, who would be watching.

Kyaaaaaaak!

I think I heard a pterosaur-like scream, similar to Monica's voice... Am I mistaken?

Monica is supposed to be in London for work today... Something feels off.
