## 29. Arsenal! Did you wait long? (1)

Parma is an aggressive team.

They play defense aggressively while pushing the line high, and during the build-up process, all but two defenders cross the halfway line to advance the ball.

Because of this, they often concede goals due to counterattacks, but conversely, they have shown strong offensive power.

This was the case in Serie B, but even in Serie A, Parma recorded 92 goals, a whopping 39 more than Lazio, who is the second-highest scoring team with 53 goals.

Of course, the team conceded 33 goals, ranking 9th in the league.

This is why people say that to beat Parma, you need an active counterattack through the flanks rather than just sitting back, because conceding goals like this is not typical of a championship-contending team.

Moreover, Parma receives more cards than expected. They were the team with the most fouls after Spezia, which is known to be the roughest team.

“Parma is a smarter team than you think.”

AS Roma's new head coach.

Andre Villas-Boas said this while looking at the scenes projected on the screen.

“A team that ranks 9th in the league for the fewest goals conceded and receives the second-most cards but has only had two send-offs... This means that Parma's defense is working well.”

Parma didn't necessarily need to focus on not conceding goals.

After all, it's a team with two monstrous attackers who score at least one goal per game.

In addition, there were some cleverly hidden points among the poor defensive indicators.

“Parma records the second-most fouls in the league, but conversely, their tackle success rate is 82%, higher than AC Milan’s 80%.”

In other words, Parma's many fouls are intentional.

“Parma is intentionally allowing some space behind them. The more the opponent focuses on counterattacking, the more space opens up between the attackers and midfielders, and Parma exchanges passes too easily in this space.”

And the endpoint of those passes is the 2-meter giant and the two attackers who pick up the second balls beneath him.

With this alone, Parma has scored 92 goals this season and is on the verge of possibly recording over 100 goals in a single season.

“In my opinion, this season's Parma is much more aggressive than the 19-20 season's Atalanta.”

Therefore, thorough preparation was needed.

Because Parma wasn’t an invincible team.

Coppa Italia Semifinals.

Roma was determined to win against Parma.

They needed to turn around the recent poor atmosphere.

While coach Villas-Boas was rearming AS Roma players with tactics and spirit, Parma's coach Alain Levagne was quietly sitting alone in his office.

‘The momentum isn’t bad.’

Parma was aiming for a mini treble this season and didn’t take any match lightly.

They had thoroughly analyzed and prepared for the upcoming Coppa Italia semifinal against AS Roma.

But coach Alain wasn’t satisfied.

Coach Alain Levagne recalled a famous saying in the football world as he lay on the sofa in his office.

- A team that attacks well wins, but a team that defends well wins championships.

That’s a wrong statement.

If you have overwhelming offense, decent defense is just a ‘paper shield.’

“Overwhelming... offense!”

He wanted even more overwhelming firepower.

A team that scores even more goals than this season.

His eyes were filled with madness.

He wanted even more goals than now.

* * *

These days, our coach seems a bit off.

I preferred the times when he used to show a bit of arrogance, giving us a little laugh.

How is it now?

Our coach, who has lost his arrogance, is like a North Korean-stricken South Korean Defense Ministry, chanting ‘Only attack... More overwhelming attack!’ while refining his tactics.

Honestly, it was a bit scary.

With quite a few matches still left in the season and the team already scoring 92 goals, his demand for even more goals seemed almost mad.

It’s kind of scary.

I thought the balance between offense and defense might collapse and cause a big downfall, but he wasn't just mindlessly shouting for attack, so we were relieved and preparing for the match against Roma.

Before the first leg of the Coppa Italia semifinal against AS Roma, we experimented with tactics in the 26th round of Serie A, and despite more than half of the squad being rotated, we won 5-1.

Our coach cheered passionately with steam almost coming out of his ever-receding hairline, and I felt like I could fry an egg on that head someday.

Anyway.

We finished our preparations well.

The day before the first leg of the Coppa Italia semifinal against AS Roma, there was a draw for the Europa League quarterfinals.

“I hope we get Feyenoord or Wolfsburg.”

Monica, who had a long break, showed her anticipation by even grabbing popcorn, which she usually wouldn’t touch.

Despite all the incidents and accidents, Arsenal was doing well in the Europa League.

She believed they could at least lift the Europa League trophy.

The teams that survived to the Europa League quarterfinals were:

-RB Leipzig

-Marseille

-Feyenoord

-Leicester City

-AS Roma

-Wolfsburg

-Parma

-Arsenal

Only strong teams remained.

Bookmakers generally saw Arsenal, Leipzig, and Leicester City as the favorites to win.

Since Parma had the next highest odds after Leicester City, it seemed they also believed we had a good chance.

“Mino! It’s starting!”

At Monica's call, I grabbed something to eat for dinner and sat on the sofa.

-RB Leipzig’s opponent is Feyenoord!

The first matchup was Leipzig and Feyenoord.

I could see a hint of disappointment in Monica’s eyes.

Among the teams that made it to the quarterfinals, Feyenoord was considered the weakest.

Next might be Wolfsburg or Marseille.

Contrary to Monica’s prayers, Marseille was drawn against Leicester City, leaving Arsenal to face either Roma, Parma, or Wolfsburg.

“Please... Please! Please!”

Monica began praying earnestly, hoping for an easier opponent like Wolfsburg.

But words that Monica, who was praying for Wolfsburg, shouldn’t have heard came next.

-Arsenal’s quarterfinal opponent is... Parma F.C!!

As soon as those words were heard, Monica stared blankly at the TV screen.

Is this what losing one’s country feels like?

After a moment, she came to her senses and asked me with cat-like eyes.

“Mino...”

“What?”

“You’ll go easy on us, right?”

I answered with a bright smile.

“No? I’m going to score like crazy?”

Slap!

It had been a while since my back felt a sting.

* * *

I got a call from Lorenzo Lupo after a long time.

He suggested we face off properly in this Europa League.

But unlike his usual confident tone, his recent message lacked energy.

It seemed like his poor performance in the league was the reason.

Having scored only 10 goals and 2 assists in 28 league matches, Lorenzo was at least doing his part in the Europa League with 7 goals in 7 matches.

Well, seeing Arsenal climb back to 5th place at a frightening speed after a disastrous start to the season, it seemed like they had something.

But is the curse of the number 9 real?

How could the 3rd top scorer in Serie B underperform so badly in the league as soon as he joined Arsenal?

It’s really scary.

Anyway, with Arsenal facing us in the quarterfinals, our group chat became quite lively.

Of course, it was because of the four mischievous friends teasing Monica.

-Jinjamilan: LOL! Ah! 4senal is science, right? 8th ranker, 8th rank!

-MilanLover: Arsenal punk... You’re finally meeting the tyrant of Serie A and getting beaten up!

-KingWangJjangJuve: LOL! Ah! Our Minho hyung will score a hat-trick even if his girlfriend supports Arsenal!

The three Koreans were chatting excitedly, and Roberto, who had been stressed out with work lately, joined in.

-Roberto: Arsenal! Don’t cry!

-Roberto: Losing to the 1st place team in Serie A isn’t embarrassing!

-Roberto: I think scoring 4 goals in both home and away matches to make it 8 goals suits the 8th ranker.

Despite the intense teasing, Monica was unfazed.

-Monica: Yep, my boyfriend Mino.

-Monica: Even if Arsenal loses in this Europa League quarterfinal, they’ll sign Mino from us in summer.

-Monica: This is just a loss to gain momentum.

-Monica: The Arsenal boom is coming.

-Monica: Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal!

Her half-crazy statements caused everyone to shudder and stop chatting.

Such fanaticism can’t be stopped by anyone.

-Jinjamilan: Seriously... What kind of team is Arsenal to have such a fanatic supporter?

I don’t know, it’s sometimes scary.

I once saw her muttering “Arsenal, let’s win!” in her sleep while taking a nap on the sofa, which made her seem pitiable.

Arsenal...

What kind of team are they?

* * *

March 8th.

The first leg of the Coppa Italia semifinal against AS Roma.

The match at Rome’s Stadio Olimpico started with Parma’s offensive from the beginning.

Unlike usual, AS Roma sat deep, blocking passes to Park Minho and Kennez as per coach Andre Villas-Boas’s instructions.

For the first 10 minutes, this seemed to work quite well.

At the same time, Costanza Spinazzola scored the first goal, exploiting the relatively high line of Parma.

Waaaah!

“Roma! Roma! Roma!”

“Yes! This is it! It feels completely different from coach Martinho!”

“Yes! If you’re going to defend, you always have to think about counterattacks! It’s completely different from Martinho who was just focused on blocking!”

“Romaaaaa!”

Despite only 3,000 fans allowed due to the new variant of COVID-19, their cheers sounded as loud as tens of thousands.

Coach Villas-Boas was thrilled, clenching his fists as his tactics worked.

But.

He didn’t know.

No, to be precise, he hadn’t experienced playing against Park Minho yet, so he was just happy.

If it were coach Martinho, as soon as this goal went in, he would have focused intensely on defense.

At least to go for a draw.

But coach Villas-Boas was different.

He continued to maintain tactics with counterattacks in mind, waiting for Parma’s mistakes.

-Gooooooal!

-Minooooo! A fantastic outside-foot kick! The ball swerves like a snake and hits the net!

-Amazing! This is Mino!

The problem was, there were no mistakes.

Roma’s defense, which sat back, was like a delicious meal for Park Minho, who had reached the pinnacle of technical skills.

AS Roma conceded an equalizer in an instant.

Coach Villas-Boas hurriedly began to rally his players.

But.

AS Roma’s players, who had many experiences of helplessly losing to Park Minho since last season, couldn’t hear coach Andre’s shouts.

Whistle!

-Aiba Cabanes! They concede a free kick in a bad position!

-Ah! This is a typical scenario where teams concede heavily to Parma! AS Roma! They need to regain their focus!

Of course, there was no intention to give them time.

The free kick taken by Park Minho flew straight into the danger zone, and Kennez dropped the ball perfectly.

It was finished off with a shot by Filippo Asnelli.

In an instant, the score was 2-1.

AS Roma conceded an equalizer and then allowed a turnaround within minutes.

“Hey! Hey! Castos! Focus! Aiba! Maintain the line! Don’t be swayed by Mino’s movements!”

Renato Mancini, the central figure in the defense, tried to maintain focus and keep the line, but he couldn’t calm the already shaken Roma defense.

Park Minho ran across the field.

He penetrated AS Roma’s defense like a lion among a herd of zebras in the savannah.

At the same time, a fast and low cross flew in.

Park Minho, who matched Santiago’s cross, touched the ball before the defense was set and took a shot with a half-beat quicker timing.

-Gooooooal!

-Minooooo! The fantasista who led Parma to the Coppa Italia victory goes on a rampage!

-Mino! Season goal number 40! This season too, Mino proves his worth!

Swoosh!

Sliding in front of the away supporters, Park Minho spread his arms wide.

As if telling them to worship him.
