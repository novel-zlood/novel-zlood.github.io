## 7. Simple Things and Things You Can't Stop Even When You Know (1)

"His movements are so predictable."

"Right?"

After the end of the A-match period.

The league schedule resumed.

Coach Alain Lavin stared intently at a player's gameplay with a stern expression.

"This could definitely be a weakness, right?"

"The chances are high."

Just like Assistant Coach Matteo said.

The player on the screen repeatedly performed predictable movements.

However, he had so many strengths that he could penetrate the opponents and create opportunities with those strengths.

Park Minho.

He's an outstanding player.

Especially, his ability to learn something is as fast as a computer reading data.

He learned other players' movements just by watching highlight videos and analysis videos available within the club.

But that wasn't always an advantage.

Park Minho lacked creative movements.

And he lacked the ability to apply basic skills in creative ways.

Some might question this.

How can a playmaker who produces sharp passes every game lack creativity?

But.

Good passes and creative movements are different things.

Park Minho is a player who can make good passes.

But on the contrary, he couldn't create creative movements that could change the game.

Additionally, there were still unproven aspects.

So far, he had played against teams of similar or lower levels, so it was tough for opponents to track his movements and passes.

But what if he faced a strong team?

Would they really not be able to target Park Minho, who shows similar patterns of passes and movements?

"Absolutely not."

No matter how well Park Minho could mimic other players' movements, if his patterns were consistent, they would definitely be read.

"As you can see in this scene, he moved to the same position and made the same passes in all five games."

"It will definitely be read eventually."

"He has playmaking skills, but... there are too many predictable movements and passes."

Therefore, until he promoted to Serie A.

Coach Alain Lavin planned to change Park Minho.

Of course, he didn't plan to change him immediately.

First, he planned to further enhance Park Minho's strengths.

In his opinion, not all 11 players on the field needed to have outstanding creativity or application skills.

Was there a reason to demand creative passes and movements from Park Minho?

He was convinced.

With Park Minho's strengths.

Even simple play would be sufficient.

"A play they can't stop even when they know."

Some football fans even mocked it as 'macro.'

Surprisingly, a right winger who rose to world-class with just that one pattern.

"Just like Arjen Robben..."

To the extent that there was a saying, "You can't stop Robben's play even if you know it."

Of course, even Robben mixed in patterns of connecting passes to Philipp Lahm turning behind him when Pep Guardiola took over Bayern Munich.

Anyway.

The immediate way to develop Park Minho was to polish his strengths.

"Did you see that?"

"Yes, I saw it. Mino's debut as a striker."

"He's really amazing at learning things."

"Yes, he's truly an outstanding player."

The more he thought about it, the deeper Coach Alain Lavin's smile grew at Park Minho's boundless potential.

* * *

A few days after returning to Parma.

Santiago said to me, "Mino! Aren't you playing on the right wing now?"

And that word became reality.

Recently, in practice, Coach Alain Lavin often placed me on the right wing.

Moreover, the training was simple.

Either crossing the ball.

Or cutting inside to shoot.

So it felt a bit awkward.

I definitely felt more comfortable in the center.

But that didn't mean I was terrible on the wing.

It was just a matter of preference.

That lazy guy said he was full while watching me.

Yeah, I don't need to hear that from an idiot who had to pay a 50 euro fine for being late.

Anyway.

That lazy guy always tried to skip training and fool around whenever he had a bit of free time.

But he wasn't lazy to the point of neglecting training.

He matched the nickname 'lazy guy' perfectly.

And he trained properly when it was time, so it was hard to criticize him entirely.

He's an adult now.

Well, he can manage on his own, right?

Besides, I've been feeling physically stronger recently.

I think I can gradually increase my playing time now.

When I subtly conveyed my opinion, Coach Alain Lavin nodded and agreed.

"Alright, Mino! Let's play a bit more than 60 minutes in the match against Cremonese."

Great.

I want to play a full match too.

I can't always play only 60 minutes, right?

* * *

Serie B Round 4.

The match against US Cremonese.

A team that has been maintaining a mid-table position in Serie B for three years straight.

With our team's strength, we could easily win with our 1.5 team.

But Coach Alain Lavin didn't let his guard down.

He placed Franco in the center.

And I was placed on the right.

Though it was a different position than usual, I wasn't too worried.

I just had to do what I usually did on the left.

(Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!)

(Son Crociati e tutti campioni!)

(Son del Parma i prodi calciatori!)

I could hear the home fans' cheering song.

Standing on the field, we took the lead from the beginning by constantly attacking Cremonese.

-The ball is quickly connected to the side.

-Parma Calcio is carrying the ball to the right unusually often today.

-So far, Mino's use on the right wing seems to be successful.

The right side wasn't much different from the left.

However, I slightly changed my playing style.

Coach Alain Lavin told me.

To try playing as he instructed.

-A long ball is connected!

-To Mino, who is breaking through on the right wing!

-Fast! Really fast!

Beoooong!

The long pass flew.

I lightly caught the pass that flew into the space behind the opposing defense, pushed back the fullback, and turned to cross the ball.

Or cut inside to shoot.

That was the movement the coach required from me.

This time, I cut inside.

-Mino! Quickly to the center! To the center!

-The defense is momentarily shaken!

"Stop him! Stop him!"

Two defenders trying to block my way.

But since I had found the angle.

I was ready to shoot even if they blocked me.

As I quickly brushed past the two defenders, an open space and a narrow angle finally appeared.

Kwoang!

The ball hit perfectly with my left foot.

The ball, which was cleanly curved, beautifully curled into a position the goalkeeper couldn't reach.

-Goooooooal! The first goal of the match is scored!

-Minooooo! The rising star of Parma scores his second league goal! And his fourth goal of the season!

-Amazing! He beat two defenders with unstoppable speed and immediately shot at that narrow angle!

-It was a perfect curved shot.

Chwaaak!

I slid into the corner and laid back.

Soon after, other Parma players rushed to me.

"You crazy guy! That was awesome!"

"That was really a devil's left foot!"

"You're truly amazing! Uwaaah!"

I understood why my friends were happy.

Because I scored a goal.

The problem was they were praising me too much.

It felt like I was flying in the air.

This kind of play is something anyone can do.

Besides, the pattern was too simple.

The pattern was highly likely to be read soon.

Moreover, I didn't understand the coach's instructions.

To do this pattern for the entire 90 minutes?

Am I a decoy in today's match?

Well, the coach must have a plan.

As I stirred up the right side, the center and left side found breathing space and many shots were made.

Thinking about that, it didn't seem like a completely wrong instruction.

But.

It felt so strange.

Until the end of the first half.

The opponent kept allowing crosses and shots from the right side, struggling.

"Why on earth?"

Feeling so strange, I asked the opposing fullback.

If he wasn't in good condition today.

The opposing fullback, who heard my words, told me.

"Fuck off."

He told me to fuck off.

* * *

"It's too dreadful."

Assistant Coach Matteo thought it was starting again.

Although his boss was undoubtedly a good person.

Sometimes, his strange mindset was a problem.

"Maybe I'm witnessing the birth of a monster that will destroy the football world."

"......"

"And the reputation of Alain Lavin, the world's greatest manager who raised such a monster, will spread."

Matteo thought.

If his boss hadn't become a football manager, he would have surely become a famous writer.

"It's dreadful. So dreadful. The football that Mino's talent and my talent will show."

This far.

If he let him indulge in his delusions any further, it would be unstoppable.

Matteo quickly interrupted his delusion.

"Are you planning to keep Mino on the field in the second half?"

"Prepare to substitute Franco with Santiago at the 15th minute of the second half. And keep Mino on the right."

"Santiago in the center, then."

Coach Alain Lavin nodded and rubbed his chin while looking at Cremonese's bench.

"More than that, the opponent's response is lukewarm."

"Indeed."

Of course, the two might think that the opponent's response was too slow.

But Cremonese's coach, Alberto Pecci, was already responding to Park Minho's simple pattern.

He had already figured out the left-footed shot after Park Minho cut inside.

So he marked Park Minho.

He placed another defender at the angle where Park Minho could shoot, responding perfectly.

Despite that, they were being shaken.

"Stop him! Even if you have to grab him!"

At the coach's shout, a Cremonese fullback hurriedly tackled Park Minho, who was cutting inside.

Park Minho easily dodged the tackle.

Then, with speed, he kicked the ball long and cut inside.

While doing so, he glanced at the goalpost from the same position as before.

Naturally, the defenders thought he was going to shoot and threw themselves to block the angle.

But Alain Lavin's instructed pattern for Park Minho wasn't just about crossing and shooting.

Tuk!

A pass instead of a shot.

Cremonese's defender was startled at the sight.

At the end of the pass awaited Parma Calcio's playmaker.

Franco Vazquez.

Kwaaang!

Splash!

Uaaahhhhhh!

A clinching goal that extended the score to 2-0.

Parma Calcio's home stadium.

Ennio Tardini was engulfed in a thunderous roar.

* * *

What are my strengths?

Decent speed and ball touch.

And good passing ability and positioning.

On top of that, a sense of shooting with both feet.

But my most confident strength recently was definitely dribbling.

And in today's match, I particularly showed off that dribbling, shaking the opponent's left side.

Tuk!

When I kicked the ball long and ran quickly, the Cremonese fullback hurriedly followed.

Was his name... Leonardo?

He sure followed well.

As I ran faster after crossing the center circle, the gap started to widen.

I could hear cursing from behind.

If he has time to curse, he should run more.

Franco Vazquez, cutting into the opposite half-space, raised his hand and called for the ball.

For now, let's push in deeper and then think.

There are only two players in front of me.

Tuk! Tuk!

With two touches, I cut deeper and dragged Cremonese's central defender while cutting inside.

I could sense the look of "Again? The same trick?" but.

This time it was different.

As I cut deeper and lightly flicked the ball with my heel, the Cremonese defense was momentarily shaken.

Elia Cobbaut, who overlapped, received my pass and sent a short cross to the center.

And the header from Dennis Man, who quickly cut in.

Splash!

Uaaahhhhhh!

The score quickly widened to 3-0.

The players rushed to Dennis Man, who scored the goal.

Watching that, I smiled brightly.

But I still couldn't understand.

"Why can't they stop something this obvious?"

Did they hear my mumbling?

The Cremonese central defender glared at me fiercely.

Looking at his face, he looked like a mafia member.

Oh, I was planning to play a full match today...

Let's just play 60 minutes again today.

I spared you, Cremonese!

......

It's definitely not because I was scared.
