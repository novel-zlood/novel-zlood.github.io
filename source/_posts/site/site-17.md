## 7. Simple Things and Unstoppable Things (1)

"His movements are predictable."

"Right?"

After the end of the international match period.

The league schedule restarted.

Coach Alain Levagne watched a player's game with a stern expression.

"This can definitely be a weakness, right?"

"Highly likely."

As Chief Coach Matteo said.

The player on the screen was making predictable movements.

But he managed to break through the opponents and create opportunities with his many strengths.

Park Minho.

An incredible player.

Especially, his ability to learn was as fast as a computer reading data.

Just by watching highlight videos or analysis videos available within the club, he learned other players' movements.

That wasn't always a strength.

Park Minho lacked creative movements and the ability to apply basic skills.

Some might wonder.

A playmaker who delivers sharp passes in every game lacks creativity?

But.

Good passes and creative movements are different.

Park Minho was a player who could deliver good passes.

However, he was the type who could not create game-changing creative movements.

Moreover, there was still an unproven aspect.

So far, he has played against teams of similar or lower levels, and the opponents struggled to keep up with Park Minho's movements and passes.

But if he faces a strong team?

Will they really be unable to target Park Minho, who shows similar patterns of passes and movements?

"Absolutely not."

No matter how well Park Minho can mimic various players' movements, if the pattern is consistent, it will definitely be read.

"If you look at this scene, he moves to the same position and makes the same pass in all five games."

"It will definitely be read later."

"He has playmaking ability, but... there are too many predictable movements and passes."

Therefore, until he was promoted to Serie A.

Coach Alain Levagne planned to change Park Minho.

Of course, he didn't plan to change him immediately.

For now, he planned to further enhance Park Minho's strengths.

In his opinion, not all 11 players on the field needed outstanding creativity or adaptability.

Is there a reason to demand creative passes and movements from Park Minho?

He was sure.

With Park Minho's strengths.

Even simple plays would be enough.

"Plays that can't be stopped even if you know them."

Some soccer fans even mocked him as 'macro.'

Surprisingly, that one pattern elevated him to the world-class level as a right winger.

"Just like Arjen Robben..."

No wonder the saying "You can't stop Robben's play even if you know it" went around.

Of course, even Robben mixed in a pattern of passing to Philipp Lahm coming around behind him during Pep Guardiola's tenure at Bayern.

Anyway.

For now, the way to develop Park Minho was to sharpen his strengths.

"Did you see it?"

"Yes, Minho's debut at the front line."

"His learning ability is truly amazing."

"Yes, he's a truly amazing player."

The more he thought about it, the deeper Coach Alain Levagne's smile grew, impressed by Park Minho's limitless potential.

* * *

A few days after returning to Parma.

Santiago said to me, "Minho! Aren't you playing on the right flank now?"

And that word became a seed.

Recently, in practice, Coach Alain Levagne had been placing me on the right flank more often.

Moreover, the training was quite simple.

Either crossing the ball or cutting inside for a shot.

So it felt a bit awkward.

I definitely felt more comfortable in the center.

Not that I'm terrible on the flank.

It's just a matter of preference.

The lazybones said he was satisfied seeing me like that.

Yeah, like I'd listen to a fool who got fined 50 euros for being late.

Anyway.

This lazybones clearly wants to skip training and play around whenever he has some free time.

But he's not lazy to that extent.

He matches his nickname 'lazybones' just right.

He trains properly when he does, so it's hard to criticize him outright.

He's an adult now.

He can figure it out himself, right?

More than that, I definitely feel my stamina improving recently.

I think I can gradually increase my playing time now.

When I subtly conveyed my opinion, Coach Alain Levagne nodded in agreement.

"Alright, Minho! Let's play a bit more than 60 minutes in the match against Cremonese."

Great.

I should try playing full-time once.

I can't keep playing only 60 minutes all the time, can I?

* * *

Serie B Round 4.

Match against US Cremonese.

A team that has maintained a mid-table position in Serie B for three years straight.

With our team's strength, even a 1.5-tier squad should be enough to beat them.

But Coach Alain Levagne didn't let his guard down.

He placed Franco in the center.

And I was positioned on the right.

Although it was a different position from usual, I wasn't too worried.

I just needed to play the same way I did on the left.

(Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!)

(Son Crociati e tutti campioni!)

(Son del Parma i prodi calciatori!)

The home fans' chants echoed in my ears.

Standing on the field, we took control of the game from the start, pressing Cremonese hard.

-The ball is quickly connected to the flank.

-Parma Calcio is unusually transporting the ball to the right today.

-This indicates that Minho's deployment on the right flank has been successful so far.

The right side wasn't much different from the left.

I just slightly changed my playing style.

Coach Alain Levagne told me to try it his way.

-A long pass connected!

-To Minho, penetrating the right flank!

-Fast! Really fast!

Whirr!

A long pass flew towards the space behind the opposing defense.

I ran to catch it lightly while shielding the defender with my back.

Then I either crossed the ball or cut inside for a shot.

This was the movement the coach asked of me.

This time, I cut inside.

-Minho! Quickly to the center! To the center!

-The defense is momentarily shaken!

"Stop him! Stop him!"

Two defenders tried to block my way.

But once I had the angle, I intended to shoot no matter what.

As I swiftly passed by the two defenders, an open space and a narrow angle appeared.

Bang!

The ball hit perfectly with my left foot.

The beautifully curved ball flew into the spot where the goalkeeper couldn't reach.

-Gooooooooooal! The opening goal of the match!

-Minhooooooooo! The rising star of Parma scores his second league goal! And his fourth goal of the season!

-Amazing! He swiftly dribbled past two defenders and immediately took a shot at that narrow angle!

-It was a perfect curling shot.

Shooosh!

I ran to the corner and slid, lying back.

Soon, other Parma players rushed towards me.

"You crazy guy! That was amazing!"

"That was truly a devil's left foot!"

"You're really something! Aaaah!"

I understand why these guys are happy.

Because I scored a goal.

The problem is they lift me up too much.

I feel like I'm flying.

This is a play anyone can make.

Moreover, it's a very simple pattern.

This pattern is highly likely to be read soon.

I also didn't understand the coach's instructions.

To keep doing this pattern for 90 minutes?

Am I a decoy in today's match?

Well, the coach must have his reasons.

As I shook the right side, the center and left got breathing room and many shots came out.

Thinking about that, it wasn't entirely wrong instructions.

But.

It was too strange.

Until the end of the first half.

The opponent kept allowing my crosses and shots from the right.

"Why on earth?"

It was so strange that I asked the opposing fullback.

Is your condition not good today?

The opposing fullback told me.

"F*** off."

* * *

"It's too scary."

Chief Coach Matteo thought it was starting again.

His boss was definitely a good person.

But sometimes that weird mentality was the problem.

"I might be witnessing the birth of a monster that will destroy the football world."

"......."

"And the reputation of the world's best coach, Alain Levagne, who nurtured such a monster, will spread."

Matteo thought.

If his boss hadn't become a football coach, he would have definitely become a famous writer.

"It's scary. So very scary. The football that Minho's talent and my talent will show."

That's enough.

If he let him indulge in his delusions any longer, he couldn't stop him.

Matteo urgently cut off his delusion.

"Are you planning to keep Minho on in the second half?"

"Prepare to substitute Santiago for Franco at the 15-minute mark in the second half. And keep Minho on the right."

"Santiago in the center then."

Coach Alain Levagne nodded and stroked his chin as he looked at Cremonese's bench.

"More than that, their response is lukewarm."

"Indeed."

Of course, both of them might think the opponent's response was too slow.

But Cremonese coach Alberto Pecci was already responding to Park Minho's simple pattern.

He had already figured out the left-foot shot that cut inside after dribbling to the center.

So he marked Park Minho and placed an additional defender in the shooting angle to perfectly counter it.

Yet they were still being shaken.

"Stop him! Even if you have to foul!"

At the coach's shout, Cremonese's fullback hurriedly tackled Park Minho, who was cutting inside.

Park Minho easily avoided the tackle.

In full speed, he kicked the ball further and cut inside.

At the same time, he glanced at the goalpost from a similar position as before.

Everyone thought it was a shot and moved to block the angle.

But Coach Alain Levagne's instructions to Park Minho included not only crosses and shots.

Tuk!

It wasn't a shot, but a pass.

Cremonese's defender was shocked.

At the end of the pass was Parma Calcio's playmaker.

Franco VÃ¡zquez was waiting.

Bang!

Thud!

Wooooooo!

A decisive goal to make it 2-0.

Parma Calcio's home ground.

Ennio Tardini was filled with roaring cheers.

* * *

What is my strength?

Decent speed and ball touch.

And good passing ability and positioning.

Moreover, a good sense of shooting with both feet.

But the strength I'm most confident in recently is undoubtedly my dribbling.

And in today's match, I especially showed off my dribbling, shaking the opponent's left flank.

Tuk!

After kicking the ball forward, I ran quickly, and Cremonese's fullback hurriedly followed.

His name was... Leonardo?

He was definitely keeping up well.

As I ran faster past the center circle, the gap started to widen.

I heard curses from behind.

If you have time to curse, run faster.

Franco VÃ¡zquez, cutting into the opposite half-space, raised his hand, requesting the ball.

Let's dive deeper and think about it.

There were only 2 players ahead of me.

Tuk! Tuk!

With two touches, I cut deeper, dragging Cremonese's central defender with me as I cut sharply to the center.

I could feel the look that said, "Again? The same thing?"

But this time, it was different.

As I cut deeper, I lightly flicked the ball forward with my heel, momentarily shaking Cremonese's defense.

The overlapping Elias Cobbaut received my pass and sent a short cross to the center.

And a quick header by Dennis Man.

Thud!

Wooooooo!

In an instant, the score widened to 3-0.

Players rushed to Dennis Man, who scored the goal.

Seeing that, I also smiled brightly.

More than that, I really don't get it.

"Why can't they stop something so predictable?"

Did they hear my mumbling?

Cremonese's central defender glared at me fiercely.

He looked like a mafia member.

Ah, I planned to play full-time today...

Let's stick to 60 minutes today as well.

I'm just being kind to Cremonese!

...

Definitely not because I'm scared.
