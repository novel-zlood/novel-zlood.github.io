## 22. The Man of the Europa League! (2)

I'm excited.

I can't believe I'm playing in the Europa League.

Anyway.

The groups for the Europa League have been set.

All we could do was steadily prepare for our match against Cremonese.

Cremonese, like us, is a newly promoted team and has focused on their signings this season to stay in Serie A.

However, as the league approaches the 6th round, they are currently sitting at 19th place on the standings.

Except for Inter and Fiorentina, Parma mostly faced easier opponents and gained momentum.

Cremonese became one of their victims.

They were determined to mark me, but...

I'm not the only one at Parma anymore.

-Gooooooooooooooal!

-Kenneth with a hat-trick! This ties him with Mino for the most goals at Parma!

-Other teams must be worried. If they focus on marking Mino, this physical beast runs free!

Kenneth's potential has exploded.

Honestly, his technical skills still aren't top-notch, but...

At least his ball touch and passing have improved since last season.

Moreover, Kenneth has an uncanny ability to understand his physical condition.

Now, the 2-meter-tall, 98kg beast started to reduce his activity level.

He reminded me of Jeremy Lukaku.

If he overexerted his massive body, it could put too much strain on his knees and other joints.

Kenneth moved like a perfect target man and a proficient line-breaking poacher.

Of course, his pace might be lacking compared to extremely fast players, but his speed was enough for line-breaking, making him more destructive.

He was literally a tank.

As this tank's technical skills gradually improved, his potential exploded.

[Parma's 'Mino-Kenneth' Minoz duo has scored 16 goals! The duo has contributed most of Parma's 20 goals in the league!]

[Kenneth shines alongside Mino! Who exactly is Alain Levagne, the genius talent scout of Parma?]

[A Parma insider, 'Kenneth's call-up was strongly insisted upon by coach Alain, and it was a great success.']

[Big clubs are salivating! They plan to spend a fortune on the 'Minoz' duo!]

In the match against Cremonese, I recorded 2 assists.

It was really easy to assist.

I just passed to Kenneth, and he did the rest.

Anyway.

Interest in Parma and me was growing.

And we continued to steadily accumulate points.

[Parma's 5-game winning streak!]

[Parma's overwhelming attack power shown in the 7th round against Verona! Although Mino was silent for 2 consecutive games, the team won 4-1!]

[Mino focuses on linking play! 3 assists in 2 games, now with 8 goals and 5 assists this season!]

-Parma's attacking line is scarier than expected?

-Mino is insane... He hasn't scored in the last 2 games, but anyone who watched the games knows. His passes are almost creating chances single-handedly!

-They call him the rebirth of Baggio... Honestly, after watching the recent games, I couldn't help but nod.

Parma showing an invincible form in the league.

Now, many people were calling me the rebirth of Baggio.

Of course, most Parma fans called me 'Fantastista' or 'Parma's God.'

But some still had reservations.

Yeah, the stage of the Europa League.

In other words, they wanted to see how I would perform in a major continental cup competition.

[Mino still needs to prove himself!]

[Can Parma's Fantastista be strong in big matches?]

[Parma's Europa League is approaching!]

"Wow... This feels a bit insulting."

After showing so much... They still want me to prove myself.

Wasn't defeating Inter enough?

Fine, if they want to see it, I'll show it to them.

[Parma heads to Belgrade!]

I need to show them properly in Serbia.

* * *

FC Red Star Belgrade.

Known as 'Red Star,' this Serbian football club is one of the top teams in the Serbian league, alongside Partizan.

Of course, Red Star also won the Serbian league last season.

Achieving a remarkable 5 consecutive league titles.

But the prestigious Red Star was no longer satisfied with just the league title.

They turned their eyes to the continental cup competition.

With the goal of 'Again 1991,' they focused on training and nurturing their players.

Although they lost in the Champions League Champions Route playoffs, they were still confident.

They were waiting for the Europa League.

And when the Europa League group draw began.

When all the teams in Group H, where Red Star was the top seed, were finalized, they clenched their fists.

"Alright!"

"It's possible! This season, it's really possible!"

"Just like when we won the Champions League in 1991, we can win the Europa League this time!"

"Go! Red Star!"

Fans were also highly optimistic.

Parma might be the toughest opponent, but...

The other clubs seemed manageable.

Red Star began preparing busily for the first group stage match of the Europa League Group H.

The league was no longer a major concern.

Their goal was the Europa League.

"Is that player Mino?"

"Even if he is, he'll fall easily with some rough defense."

"It's a home game at our turf. Let's show that dumb Asian how soft the grass in Belgrade is."

They were confident.

Even if it was an away game, the first match was at their home.

They might not win, but they were confident they wouldn't lose.

Their confidence was evident in the pre-match interviews.

[Mino? He will be quiet in Belgrade.]

[Red Star is confident of at least a draw in this match.]

[Coach Dejan Stankovic's confidence! Can Red Star secure points in this match?]

[Red Star's strong confidence! What kind of game will they show against Parma at home?]

It wasn't just Red Star that was brimming with confidence.

Parma was also full of confidence.

They were leading the league.

Which means they were on a roll.

Their performance was top-notch.

[Coach Alain, 'Every team has a solid plan. Until they concede a goal to Mino!']

[Parma confident in scoring many goals away! Can they showcase their attacking power at Red Star's home?]

The light jabs from the coaches and some players of both teams drew a lot of attention.

And time flew by, and September 15 arrived.

The first group stage match of the Europa League was just around the corner.

* * *

FC Red Star.

The official name is 'FK Crvena Zvezda.'

Well, since 'Crvena Zvezda' means Red Star...

Calling them Red Star isn't wrong.

Anyway, this team had an undefeated season in the Serbian league for the 20-21 season.

Maybe because of that, they've been focusing on the recent continental cup competitions rather than the league title.

It felt like they had prepared a lot.

Unlike me, my teammates seemed oddly tense as they entered the locker room.

I heard that Crvena Zvezda's supporters.

In other words, Red Star's supporters are known to be quite wild.

I heard that when Red Star defeated Young Boys in the Champions League playoffs in the 19-20 season and advanced to the main tournament, some hardcore hooligans paraded in a tank, causing controversy.

It was just astonishing and astonishing again.

Well, Kenneth seemed quite calm.

He looked as if he had returned to his homeland.

I thought it might be due to the Eastern European connection, but...

It didn't seem to be the case.

Anyway.

The players all seemed tense.

"Hey, are you nervous?"

"No."

The joker answered with a sly smile.

But the corners of his mouth trembled slightly.

He wasn't in good shape.

Surely, hearing the wild chants and boos from the Eastern European hooligans echoing into the away locker room, who wouldn't be nervous?

Of course, they would get through it.

The veteran players were also trying to shake off their nerves by following their own routines.

I heard the sound of a wooden fish somewhere.

It seemed to have a calming effect on the players, so I left it alone.

I was a bit worried that they might all shave their heads and enter a monastery.

"Don't be too nervous."

"Mino..."

"They're just rough, nothing more."

"Yeah, Mino is right."

Kenneth agreed with me.

Well... Anyone who tries to body check this monster would end up rolling on the grass like a 6-year-old.

"Alright! Everyone, don't be too tense. No matter how rough they play, they wouldn't lack professional spirit, right?"

Yeah, Gianluca was right.

They wouldn't be such garbage players, would they?

A bit of grass juice on the uniform, and that would be it.

But that was a huge miscalculation.

It would have been great if it was just a lame joke about Gyeonggi-do, but...

Aaaaaah!

Just over 10 minutes into the match.

Gianluca fell clutching his ankle.

The referee immediately pulled out a yellow card for Red Star's fullback, Zoran Milikovic.

Boooooo!

The home fans booed loudly.

They wanted him to get up quickly and stop faking it.

But Gianluca, who had been properly kicked in the ankle, had to leave the field on a stretcher.

"Seriously? They've crossed the line?"

It was a rough and dirty tackle that would have been a red card if it went a bit deeper.

Gianluca, who had started as a starter, was out, and Yoan Bochani came onto the field with a pale face.

Oh no.

My dark dragon, which I had sealed away, was trying to emerge.

Ugh! The soul of the 15-year-old Park Minho, who dreamed of being a great actor, stirred in my left hand.

At that moment, the opponent had crossed a big line.

Zoran Milikovic, smirking and muttering something, looked at me and subtly made a slant-eye gesture.

He would definitely face disciplinary action after the match.

But that wasn't enough for me.

A rebellious streak emerged.

"Are you laughing?"

The great actor of the field descended today.

An actor with acting skills that would be praised even in Hollywood.

* * *

The Europa League match was naturally broadcasted in Korea.

After all, Park Minho's story was quite sensational, and interest in overseas football had grown thanks to Shin Junseo's performance in the EPL.

Moreover, the results weren't mediocre.

The performance in Serie B was overwhelming, and this season, Park Minho was rapidly climbing the attacking metrics in Serie A from the start.

It was a Europa League broadcast featuring such a player.

There was no reason not to broadcast this match.

Additionally, his playing style was captivating, attracting more fans.

-Ah! Crvena Zvezda's play is quite rough today! Parma's players are protesting to the referee, but... Today's referee seems quite lenient.

-That earlier situation could have warranted a red card. But the referee pulled out a yellow card.

-Still, Parma's attack isn't bad.

-The ball is passed to Park Minho!

-He seems to be in good condition today. His movements are excellent.

Zoran Milikovic sneered at Parma's attackers, who seemed weaker than expected.

This was their home turf.

Even if they played a bit rough, the referee's decisions were more lenient.

A study at a British university showed videos of tackles by home team players to referees and asked them to judge whether it was a foul.

The group that watched the videos with enthusiastic cheers from home fans and the group that watched the videos in silence had significantly different results.

The referees were 15-20% more lenient in their judgments.

The same was true for today's match.

Red Star's defenders were handling Parma's players roughly, yet only one yellow card had been issued.

They planned to secure at least a draw today and happily take one point at home.

Winning would be great, but they couldn't push their line up because of Parma's fierce attack.

Especially, they couldn't ignore the almost 2-meter-tall giant, fearing they'd concede a goal immediately.

But apart from that tall guy, there were no scary attackers in Parma.

'Mino? You'll be our sacrifice too.'

Just then, Park Minho received the ball.

Zoran Milikovic's eyes gleamed as he charged forward.

He intended to give a rough but fair tackle as a greeting.

A bit rough, but it was a legitimate tackle.

Zoran Milikovic thought so.

But the reaction was unexpected.

"Aaaaaaah!"

His foot barely grazed Park Minho's ankle.

Zoran knew it wasn't a tackle to scream about.

Beep!

The referee blew the whistle and approached.

"Hey! It wasn't that bad!"

Zoran yelled at Park Minho and tried to help him up, but Park Minho remained on the ground clutching his ankle.

The bigger problem was the referee was listening to the VAR (Video Assistant Referee) through his earpiece.

The referee headed to the monitor for a video review.

He spent a long time watching Zoran's tackle on Park Minho and started to ponder.

It didn't seem like a deep tackle.

But the angle was quite tricky, making it look like Zoran's tackle hit the ankle before the ball.

Coach Alain also quietly reviewed the scene on a tablet brought by a staff member.

"A perfect foul."

The defender likely didn't intend it.

But the angle suggested a card-worthy tackle.

However, since it was a home game, it could have ended with just a warning.

The problem was Zoran already had a yellow card from the earlier foul on Gianluca.

The referee also needed to stop the match from getting rougher.

So, it was a foul at a crucial moment.

The referee returned to the field after watching the VAR.

And he pulled out a card for Zoran.

The second yellow card.

And then the bright red card.

-Zoran Milikovic! Sent off! Sent off!

-Red Star was too rough! The referee needed to set an example!

-They should have been smarter. It's a home game, so they could play rough to some extent... But this was too much.

-Now Red Star has to defend against 11 attackers with just 10 men!

The match resumed.

With a crucial defender sent off, Red Star hurriedly brought in a substitute and had to sit back defensively.

Parma was a team perfectly capable of deliciously exploiting a team that sat back.

-Mino! Free kick!

-Goooooooooooal!

-A fantastic free kick goal by Mino!

-Mino scores his debut goal in the Europa League with a free kick! Parma takes the lead with Mino's goal!

Now, the urgent side was Red Star.

It's advantageous to secure points at home, after all.

But they couldn't raise their line easily.

Bang!

A defender fell as if hit by a truck, and Kenneth roared after scoring.

The moment they hastily raised their line in a hurry, Parma punished them immediately.

Of course, the assist came from Park Minho.

A perfect pass that broke the opponent's line cleanly.

Kenneth scored and let out a beastly roar.

-Ah! Crvena Zvezda! Not looking good!

-They concede a second goal here.

Boooooo!

The home fans erupted in loud boos.

They realized the victory had slipped away.

A 2-0 lead.

But the Red Star fans hadn't realized yet.

The match had just passed the halfway point of the first half.

* * *

Already the fifth card.

The opponent was completely intimidated.

My body was already covered in grass stains.

On the other hand, they must be full from collecting so much yellow cheese.

"Another free kick."

"Mino! Aim for the left side this time."

It was just past 45 minutes into the second half.

An additional 9 minutes were given.

What did that mean?

It meant I had taken plenty of rest on Belgrade's grass.

I understood why Neymar dives.

To survive in a much rougher France, he became a professional diver.

I didn't plan to blame him.

"Aah... This is sweet."

I had also thoroughly tasted and enjoyed it.

Looking at the crying Serbian kid glaring at me, I thought.

Diving was indeed thrilling.

Combining Neymar's diving, Middle Eastern-style time-wasting, and Korean-style swamp football.

Even though I was the only one playing like this, the opponent could do nothing, and I could play comfortably without risking injury.

Kenneth looked at me with a tempted expression.

Honestly, diving doesn't suit his physique.

Anyway, the score was 2-0.

Another free kick opportunity came to me.

What did that mean?

It was a chance to score another goal.

A bit far.

And the opponent seemed to have lost a lot of focus.

"Perfectly curl it..."

Stepping back slowly, I quickly ran towards the ball as the referee blew the whistle.

I didn't signal to other players.

I planned to take it myself.

Booooom!

The ball curved cleanly, brushing the goalkeeper's fingertips.

Slap!

And the shaking net.

As soon as I scored, I ran to the corner flag and pretended to wring my grass-stained uniform while smiling.

The reaction was almost like a riot.

People trying to storm the field, cursing, and throwing objects at me.

Honestly, it was a bit scary.

But I had no reason to come here again after today's match.

Next time, I would meet them in Parma, where there were fanatics who worshipped me like a god.

What was there to fear?

I quietly observed the raging Red Star home fans and thought.

Why 'God of War' made a comeback.

I could somewhat understand his feelings.

This was truly thrilling.
