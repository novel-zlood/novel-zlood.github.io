## 23. The Villain Appears (3)

Let's go back to a few days ago.

So, it was around 10 days after our September 15th match against Red Star, where I gave my best performance as an actor.

After the match against Benevento, the coach quietly called me to his office. When I got there, I saw our coach Alain, who seemed to be in his "genius coach" mode, seriously looking at the tactical board.

Ah, that looks similar to a scene from a documentary about a team on Nutflix...

Let's just play dumb for our coach's sake.

"Coach, what's the matter?"

"Ah, Minho! I've been waiting for you."

Only after I spoke did our coach snap out of his "I'm a genius coach who was so lost in tactics that I didn't notice a player entering the office" mode.

The coach slowly changed the magnets from the 3-4-3 formation to a 5-4-1 and then looked at me.

"Minho... We're planning to secure points against Juventus with a ten-back defense."

At first, I didn't understand why he was telling me this, but as soon as he showed me the video of our match against Red Star, where I exuberantly flopped around, I got it.

"This is...?"

"It was a brilliant dive."

"That's right."

"Minho, what do you think the opposition would do if all the players in a ten-back defense started diving and rolling around on the field during an away game?"

"I don't know."

"Aren't you curious?"

I nodded vigorously at that question.

Honestly, I was curious. A team that usually plays aggressive football suddenly adopting a ten-back defense and lying down on the field...

If a ninja came out later and wiped out all the players, it could become a legendary masterpiece.

"So, what do I need to do?"

"You will play as a central midfielder against Juventus."

"I can do that."

"And during training, teach some of the players the art of diving."

I wasn't sure if diving was something that could be taught, but I nodded anyway.

Thus began our preparations for the Juventus match.

We started preparing how to defend and counterattack using the 5-4-1 formation.

I began teaching the players how to act.

"If you overdo it, the referee will realize it's acting."

"Even if you act like you're diving just 3-4 times at the right moments, it's enough to intimidate the opposition."

"Okay! When they come in like this... just fall as if you were slightly tripped, and it'll look completely convincing."

I felt guilty.

Teaching young players with bright eyes how to dive was heartbreaking.

Ironically, seeing those young players imitate my acting well gave me a strange sense of accomplishment.

Anyway.

The time, whether short or long, passed, and our match against Juventus arrived, where my teachings truly shone.

Diving at critical moments.

Lying down even at the slightest contact and wasting time by passing the ball around slowly.

Finally, a solid defense set up in two lines like two parked buses.

The home fans started booing at Parma, who appeared with a completely different style of play than Juventus had expected.

Boo! Boo! Boo!

- In the first 15 minutes, the two teams have only managed one shot each. That's how well Parma is handling Juventus's attacks with their ten-back defense.
- This must be confusing. Parma, a team that usually plays aggressively like Atalanta, is now showing movements reminiscent of Mourinho's Chelsea.

Although Juventus completely dominated possession with a ratio close to 7:3...

Strangely, Parma seemed to be controlling the flow of the game.

"Show us some football!"

"You bastards! Now I understand why Parma went bankrupt! It's because of this crappy football!"

"Argh! Hugo! Just push through!"

Among the desperate cries of the home fans.

The young Parma players, initially intimidated by the boos, now lay down on the field more actively.

Now it was a bit scary.

It felt like I had poisoned Parma.

"Aaaaaah!"

Filippo Ascoli screamed and fell.

Playing as an attacking midfielder today, he clutched his face and fell at a perfect moment when he was about to lose the ball.

It's true that Juventus midfielder Gigi Locatelli's hand was a bit high, but it wasn't enough to make someone fall as if their nose was broken.

Gigi Locatelli, confused.

The referee pulled out the first yellow card of the match.

- Ah! Gigi Locatelli! That arm was too high!
- Today's referee has been lenient on physical battles, but in the end, Juventus receives a yellow card!

The referee was lenient on physical battles, but he was also quick to give cards for significant fouls.

With Gigi Locatelli, who was responsible for controlling Juventus's midfield, receiving a card, it was clear that the pressure in the center would be less than before.

Our defense was perfect.

So, what about our counterattack?

We executed our plan as prepared, causing Juventus major headaches.

Why did I come down to the center?

Why was Kenneth positioned as the lone striker?

It was to draw out time and then send a ball behind Juventus's advanced defense line.

The player receiving that ball?

Kenneth, who could play both target man and poacher roles with his overwhelming physicality at Parma.

- Minho's long pass!
- Kenneth is running! How can he be so agile with that body?
- Juventus's backline is momentarily breached!

Kenneth aimed for Juventus's backline, running and taking a non-stop shot.

Thud!

Oooooh!

A shot narrowly missing the goalpost.

But Juventus's defense must have been chilled to the bone at that moment.

Just look at Western Daniels beside me, sighing in relief.

While we had everyone except Kenneth defending, Juventus, true to Allegri's balanced approach, showed a balanced but not particularly strong defense.

Without strong pressing and with a weaker midfield battle compared to Parma, Juventus seemed like an easy prey.

I understood why our coach had us sit back.

Teams with strong midfields and aggressive pressing, like Liverpool, could produce results against a ten-back defense.

They could forcibly get players lying on the ground back up.

But Juventus wasn't that kind of team.

They had no choice but to watch us lie down.

A surprisingly weak central midfield line.

No strong forward pressing.

Counterattacks and cross plays relying on Patricia Dybala.

That was all Juventus's football consisted of.

If the opposition seemed slightly rough, we'd lie down.

When we took the ball, we'd aggressively push forward, causing Juventus's midfield to appeal to the referee like children who had their candy taken away.

I laughed at the sight.

Even knowing that Juventus's midfielder Western Daniels beside me was looking at me with a disgusted expression.

* * *

- Juventus is in serious trouble.
- Instead, Parma, which sat back with a ten-back, has taken 5 shots, while Juventus has only managed 2 shots, ending the first half.

While the home fans gnashed their teeth at Parma's football, the Parma fans who had followed to the away game were all smiles.

"This is it! This is football!"

"Hahaha! What? Aiming for the championship this season? Juventus, go beat Inter below you first!"

"Parma! Parma! Parma!"

They were having a blast.

Boring football?

As long as they continued to maintain their first-place standing in the league, it would be fun.

Besides, Parma wasn't a team that only used a ten-back.

Parma was a team that had come this far with attacking football.

There was no reason to be criticized for using a ten-back in just one match.

Honestly, it was fun in its own way.

It was quite enjoyable to watch Juventus self-destruct in anger.

Teasing the opponent, lying down to waste some time.

Sending sharp passes and crosses to the front.

A 2-meter giant aiming at Juventus's goal.

If it weren't for goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny, Juventus might have already sunk.

- ReallyMilan: Hahahaha
- MilanoLove: Juventus is ruined hahaha. Ah! It would be better to lose with a hat trick hahaha. Is there really a team losing to Parma's ten-back? Boom boom boom!
- Roberto: Juventus! Don't be too disappointed. Still, you are the only strong team in Serie A to face Minho as a central midfielder!

All kinds of mockery were heard.

However, there was one die-hard Juventus fan who held back.

- KingWangJjangJuve: Amor Fati.

He quickly turned his hope circuit.

- KingWangJjangJuve: Wait. Allegri's magic will unfold! Once halftime is over and the second half begins, it's over.
- KingWangJjangJuve: Calm before the storm!
- KingWangJjangJuve: To those who laughed at me and Juventus in this chat room, I will tell you properly.
- KingWangJjangJuve: Whether you are pathetic or we are pathetic, the result will tell.

Yes, the result was still 0-0.

After halftime, Juventus could start their counterattack.

That's what football is.

But.

What he expected did not happen.

There was no Allegri magic.

There was no counterattack in the second half.

- Goooooooal!
- Minhooooooo! A fantastic long-range shot in extra time in the second half!
- This is Minho! Juventus is now in real trouble! Juventus will now become even more desperate!
- If they lose today, they will drop to 4th place in the league! Inter and Lazio, who finished their matches earlier, will rise above Juventus!

Park Minho, who scored a goal, ran quickly.

Toward the home fans, no less.

He did a finger tornado and then leaped up to show the celebration of someone who didn't perform well at Juventus.

He looked just like a villain.

"Hoooooo!"

Naturally, Park Minho's celebration provoked the Juventus home fans enormously.

They cursed at the sight of the number 24 jersey.

"You bastard!"

"Kill him! Kill that bastard!"

"Aaaaargh! You son of a bitch!"

"Cazzo! Someone grab that guy!"

And the group chat room watching this scene exploded.

- ReallyMilan: Hahaha is this the power of cliché? God! Wind! Before! Night! It's a continuous victory!
- MilanoLove: Wow.... Is this the dignity of a 'fantasy star'?
- Roberto: Hahahaha Juventus season 1 sinking!

While everyone cheered at Juventus's downfall.

Only one person shed tears of sadness.

- KingWangJjangJuve: I want to be alone. Everyone, please leave.

As soon as he posted that message, he was banned from the chat room for 24 hours, making him truly alone.

[Comments]

- If you want to win the league, you better make a good impression on our Parma. Did you see what happened to Juventus?
- Ah! Although winning the league might be difficult, we have enough ability to properly trip others up, hahaha.
- We just need to qualify for the Champions League, right?
- Thank you, Parma bros! Thanks to you, Inter has risen to second place!
- Lazio also sends their gratitude!
- What about Milan and Napoli, the next opponents?
- What do you mean, hahaha. They should be ready to face Minho.

Despite Parma's thin depth, they are currently leading Serie A, but most opinions are that they will eventually drop off in the second half.

Parma agreed with those opinions.

Their original goal was to finish within the top 7.

Their current performance far exceeded their original goal.

Coach Alain Levagne thought.

He knew it would be hard to win the league.

He also knew they needed to focus on the Europa League.

However, he had no intention of giving up easily.

He wanted to properly sprinkle red pepper powder.

The start was the match against Juventus.

The result was good.

They narrowly won 1-0, but in terms of content, they completely dominated Juventus.

In the remaining matches against the strong teams in Serie A, he planned to use tailored tactics like in the Juventus match to properly disrupt them.

If they continued to accumulate victories against strong teams, Parma, which acted as villains in Serie A, might become enough of a contender to aim for the throne.

Coach Alain Levagne quietly stroked his chin and thought.

If they could hold onto first place until February, it might really be possible.
