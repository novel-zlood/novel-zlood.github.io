## ### 30. Mini Treble! (4)

Thanks to Filippo's rampage, we easily lifted the Coppa Italia trophy. A few days later, in the 35th round of the league, I was able to step onto the field with a light body.

To be honest, the remaining league matches weren't particularly crucial, so our coach rotated the squad as much as possible to check the players' performance.

Our opponent was Cagliari.

A weak team sitting at 15th place in the league.

Honestly, this match didn't provide much motivation, so we showed signs of being heavily shaken by their attacks.

Of course, we didn't lose.

Kenneth and I each scored a goal, securing a comfortable 2-1 victory.

However...

Our coach wasn't satisfied.

As he entered the locker room, he awakened the slightly relaxed spirits of the players who had recorded the double.

"Even if we finish this season splendidly, there’s always the next season. There are no eternal champions."

Thanks to that, in the 36th round of the league, we maintained a good momentum with a 3-2 comeback victory against AC Milan, bringing our points total to 94.

Well, I also achieved a record.

[Park Minho Sets Record for Most Goals in a Serie A Season!]

[Park Minho Becomes the Top Scorer in Serie A!]

[Park Minho Astonishes Everyone with 38 League Goals – Will He Succeed in Other Leagues?]

With the most goals in a Serie A season.

I scored 2 more goals than the 36 goals recorded by Immobile and Higuain, becoming the new record holder.

Despite scoring so many goals, I was still 14 goals shy of Messi’s record of 73 goals in a single season.

I was so curious about how that record was even achieved.

Anyway...

After securing a 2-1 victory against Sassuolo, we headed to Budapest, the capital of Hungary.

Our opponent in the Europa League final was AS Roma.

Honestly, I thought... an easier opponent than expected had made it to the Europa League final.

We had rarely lost to AS Roma recently, and most of our victories were by a large margin.

However, we didn't let our guard down.

The final is a big stage where various variables can arise, making it an unpredictable environment.

Honestly, neither I nor the other Parma players had ever been in a continental competition final before.

On the other hand, AS Roma had the experience of winning the Europa Conference League last season.

This was a difference that couldn’t be overlooked.

So I was a bit worried.

Worried that the younger players might waver.

That thought made me ponder.

Fortunately, the young players' expressions were quite firm.

No one seemed to be relaxing upon arriving in Hungary.

Nor was anyone trembling with excessive tension.

Well, having experienced winning the league and Coppa Italia... there wouldn’t be many friends who would be overly nervous.

The slacker said while eating the hotel breakfast.

He wanted to clinch the Europa League title this time.

Seeing the usually lackadaisical guy say something so serious, the other players showed curious expressions.

This meant that the Europa League final was more important to Santiago than other matches.

"We have to win the Europa League to get a 5% salary increase. If my salary goes up... I’ll buy the limited-edition LP I couldn’t get last time. Or should I get a new sports car?"

I take that back.

This guy is just a fool.

The slacker can never be serious.

I was a fool to trust such a guy.

* * *

Due to the variant of COVID, the schedule was delayed, so we had our final league match two days after the Europa League final.

Well, the new variant is more infectious than Omicron but has a much lower fatality rate, so honestly, as a non-specialist, I didn’t know the details.

According to the news, we might be able to live without masks from the start of the next season, which made me sigh in relief.

Honestly, matches without spectators or with half-full stadiums were disappointing.

How can a football player make a living?

It’s all thanks to the fans.

Anyway...

The cheers of fans filling the Puskás Aréna in Budapest, Hungary, reached my ears.

"Parma! Parma! Parma!"

"Roma! Roma! Roma!"

The fans of both teams shouted louder, as if they were in a fight, calling out the names of their respective teams.

"It's the Europa League final."

"The opponent is AS Roma, who we've met often before. Honestly, they’re not that difficult of an opponent."

"But... in the Europa League final, I don’t know how they’ll come out."

"They have the experience of winning the Conference League. Only the football gods would know how that might factor in."

At our coach’s last comment, someone replied, "Then Minho would know well, right?"

That turned the locker room into a sea of laughter.

"Yeah, we have the football god on our side. Others may think Messi is the football god... but at Parma, Minho is the god."

"Minho is here. And we have the team that shed blood and sweat against the Serie A powerhouses for today’s match."

"Play a match with no regrets."

Matches with no regrets...

There are hardly any such matches, but generally, you don’t regret matches you win, as Hyung Junsuh taught me.

That hyung said he still couldn’t forget losing the Champions League final.

As I stepped onto the field, I looked at the Roma players.

I noticed Joaquin Fernandez, who was signed from Sevilla this winter.

He had suffered a three-month injury right after joining, but he was playing in the Europa League final.

That showed how high his potential was.

Was it because it was the Europa League final?

The atmosphere felt different from usual.

The same went for us.

Roma also felt different.

Thus, the match began.

The opponent came out with a 4-1-4-1 formation.

We came out with a 3-4-1-2 formation.

It was a match where Parma, centered around me in the second line, slowly unraveled the game from the center, while Roma aimed for quick counterattacks from the flanks.

We seized the early flow.

Roma seemed to be planning to slowly unfold the game based on a defense-first, counterattack-later approach.

For Roma, who suffered greatly against us in the Coppa Italia, stabilizing the defense was essential.

On the other hand, we didn’t make any drastic changes.

We started our football slowly against Roma.

However, there was an unexpected incident.

To be precise, it was our slacker’s mistake.

- Snapshot taken!

- Parma concedes a penalty just 3 minutes into the first half!

- It seems the referee judged that the ball touched Santiago’s hand.

The slacker, who threw himself to defend on the flank, carelessly raised his hand, and seeing that hand, Tammy Abraham lifted the ball to hit our slacker’s hand.

Yes, it was a situation similar to what happened in the Champions League final between Liverpool and Tottenham.

I was a bit worried.

Would the players be shaken by such a variable?

Would the slacker get discouraged?

However...

The slacker was shameless.

Like someone addicted to gambling, he shouted, "Ah! I’ll repay it by scoring a goal!" which surprised me a bit.

Thud!

- Goooooal! Tammy Abraham scores with a penalty in the 4th minute of the first half, giving Roma a pleasant lead over Parma!

- It’s certainly Roma, who won the Europa Conference League last season!

- They’re quite composed. Roma!

Anyway...

Parma started trailing after conceding the first goal.

Of course, there was no sign of impatience on the players’ faces.

There was still plenty of time, and we knew our strength was far superior to the opponent’s.

- The ball is passed to Minho!

- Minho dribbles the ball slowly forward!

- We can visibly see Roma’s defense tensing up! That’s how much Minho has been a beast for Serie A teams!

Like other teams, Roma also marked me with two players, making it hard to break through.

I had no choice but to slowly unravel the game with passes in this match as well.

Fortunately, the other players’ conditions were good.

Filippo, receiving a long ball on his chest, shielded the ball with his back against the defender.

- Filippo! He holds onto the ball!

- Filippo passes to Santiago, who’s breaking through on the flank! Santiago carries the ball in!

- Santiago’s short pass!

- Kenneth shoots! Goooooal!

- Parma equalizes in the 11th minute of the first half!

- With a fantastic attacking play, Parma brings the match back to square one!

As soon as the score was tied, Roma's coach, Andre Villas-Boas, had a hardened expression.

His face seemed to say, "This doesn’t work either?"

It was certainly a clean link-up play.

Filippo, who had lost the fierce form he showed in the Coppa Italia final, gave a thumbs-up to Kenneth.

Certainly, our attacking line was as good as Real Madrid’s.

Kenneth-Filippo-Santiago.

These three created space in the attack, allowing me to move more freely.

With Fabian Pavone, the winger on the opposite side, moving into the center to join the defense as Santiago pushed up, our aggressive tactics worked even better.

Of course, there were not only advantages.

The flank was easily penetrated again.

Klaz Tursha hurriedly ran and blocked Roma’s cross with his body, but the cross sharply flew into the danger zone towards Joaquin Fernandez.

Luckily, goalkeeper Jose Juan caught the ball, thwarting Roma’s counterattack.

Still, it was a reminder of the threat posed by their flank counterattacks.

It was a somewhat sluggish atmosphere in the game.

To change the flow of this match, a stunning goal that could lift the spirits was needed.

"Joshua!"

At my shout, Joshua connected a clean pass perfectly to my feet.

Tap!

As I slowly advanced with the ball, I noticed Roma’s defensive midfielder rushing in.

Dragging the ball slowly, I then kicked it to one side and quickly accelerated to attempt a breakthrough.

At a timing that made it hard for the opponent to react.

* * *

- Minho dribbles the ball up!

Andre Villas-Boas wasn’t a coach who showed big reactions in the technical area.

He hid his emotions well and often used the methods he learned from Mourinho to unsettle opponents through the media.

Yes, he had a slightly similar feel to Mourinho.

Of course, his tactics wouldn’t be the same, but his various actions from his time at different teams made him resemble Mourinho.

Thanks to that, even though he didn’t leave a significant mark in the EPL, he attracted attention from the English football community.

He had star quality.

- Minho! He dribbles up with the ball!

- Filippo and a one-two pass!

- Minho’s rabona kick! The ball goes high! Kenneth’s header!

- Ah! It narrowly misses!

"Damn! Focus! Focus!"

But now was not the time.

He was yelling in the technical area like a certain Italian coach from Tottenham.

It was unlike him.

However, seeing the movement of the opponent's attacker, he couldn’t just sit and watch.

"Fuck!"

Rough curses mixed with a Portuguese accent burst out.

As Park Minho started to run wild, the defense he had prepared for Roma began to shake.

Like buildings on the coast swept away by a tsunami.

Roma's defense was completely swept away.

"If we can just hold out at 1-1 until the first half ends, we can win!"

"Hold out! Hold out! Why are you running like girls?"

"Advance! Advance! Don’t just keep getting hit, press when necessary!"

At the rough shouts of Villas-Boas, Roma’s players came to their senses and pressed Parma’s attackers.

But at the moment they aggressively advanced, Park Minho didn’t miss it.

"Pass it to Filippo!"

Hearing Park Minho’s voice, Joshua didn’t hesitate and sent a long pass to Filippo, who was turning on the right flank.

Boom!

Honestly, it was an ambiguous position.

Filippo wasn’t the type of forward who broke through the defensive line in the box and cut in from the flank.

It was questionable, but Joshua didn’t doubt.

The ball was perfectly connected to Filippo.

Seeing Park Minho moving nearby, Joshua thought, "Minho must be planning something with Filippo!"

However...

What Filippo Asnelli showed was entirely different from what he expected.

- Filippo takes the ball and immediately tries to break through!

- Was this player always this skillful with the ball? Castos Vinha quickly gets beaten by Filippo!

Filippo Asnelli suddenly burst in.

AS Roma’s defense was flustered.

A target man who only knew how to play post and link suddenly dribbled and charged.

The problem was, as they rushed to stop him.

Filippo, without hesitation, passed the ball to Park Minho next to him and went deeper.

Park Minho, who held the ball in a completely free position.

Andre Villas-Boas shouted in a panicked voice.

"Stop him!!"

Thud!

Of course, even if he shouted to stop him, Roma’s goalkeeper, Pau Sabatia, couldn’t do anything.

The ball had already left Park Minho’s foot and beautifully curved into the top of Roma's goal.

- Goooooal!

- Minhooo! A tremendous goal at a crucial moment! Indeed, Parma has this player!

- The score becomes 2-1! Parma shows their might by successfully turning the game around!

Seeing the net shake, Andre Villas-Boas tore at his hair and screamed.

"How do you expect me to stop that! Huh? Fucking football! Fucking sport! Fucking Parma!"

Hearing his screams from a little distance, Alain Levagne on Parma's bench chuckled and muttered to himself.

"Football is truly fun."
