## 21. A Player Smiling Even When the Team is Losing! (2)

San Siro.

Also known as Giuseppe Meazza.

A stadium with a massive spiral concrete structure and red steel frames that symbolize its long history.

It might seem quite rough at first glance.

However, for the football fans in Milan, that roughness is nothing less than a symbol.

"Did you see it last time?"

"Oh, the new stadium being built next to it? When will it be finished?"

"They said in 2024."

But San Siro was now nearing its end.

AC Milan and Inter were constructing a new stadium next to the historic San Siro.

The new stadium, designed in the style of Duomo Cathedral, had already started to take shape.

It was expected to be fully revealed in about two years.

In that sense, both Inter and AC Milan squads wanted to build their legacy before 2024.

-The team that won the last league title at San Siro.

Naturally, this title attracted a lot of attention.

The players were also conscious of this.

In this sense, Inter's last season's victory served as a strong motivator.

They aimed for another league title this season, potentially winning three consecutive league titles.

They couldn't let their neighbors, AC Milan, take the title of "the last team to win at San Siro."

This put a lot of pressure on Inter's squad early this season, but it also served as great motivation in crucial matches.

-Goooaaaal!

-Inter's wing-back, Goran Perisic, scores a fantastic header just 7 minutes into the first half!

-Inter is truly different today! It's hard to believe this is the same team that drew 0-0 against Fiorentina in the last match!

Inter had no intention of repeating the mistakes they made last season.

Parma may be a newly promoted team.

But Inter was fully aware of their strength, having won the Coppa Italia last season.

-It's not easy.

-Parma! Unlike their recent matches, they're giving up control too easily.

-If it weren't for their players Farnau Casas and Jose Juan, Parma would have conceded three goals by now.

-The two players from Spain are barely holding the shaky Parma together.

Parma's young players were overwhelmed by Inter's high-level performance and couldn't focus.

In the 16th minute of the first half.

Inter's attacking midfielder, Cisse Brugman, scored a scissors kick that went straight into the goal.

Even Jose Juan, the goalkeeper with animal-like reflexes, couldn't block the exquisite shot.

-Inter takes a 2-0 lead in an instant!

-Inter is paying back for the defeat they suffered in the Coppa Italia!

-Coach Alain Levagne is quickly adjusting his players' positions! But it's not easy!

-Yes, Inter! They are not loosening their attacking grip.

Coach Gino Inzaghi clenched his fist the moment the team's second goal went in.

That's it.

Unlike last season, Parma had definitely improved.

Their squad had gotten younger.

Various talents had joined the team.

But.

Without veterans, Parma couldn't withstand the fierce onslaught of the giant Inter.

Ferelle Canasini, making his debut in today's match, was being relentlessly outplayed by Pietro Barella.

Parma's flanks, the starting points of their attack, were completely blocked by Inter's Goran Perisic and Kristof Lazaro.

Santiago Brunetta occasionally showed effective breakthroughs.

But no passes connected to Park Minho.

"Mino... This is the limit of a team like Parma."

Yes, no matter how great a player he is.

In the end, he's just one of the eleven players.

Of course, Park Minho is different.

He's a player who can change the flow of the game.

That's why extra precautions were taken.

In Spain, such a player is called a "crack."

Well, the exact pronunciation is closer to "krak."

But in Italy, such a player is called this.

"Fantasia."

Coach Gino Inzaghi quietly stroked his chin as he watched Park Minho drop back to support the defense.

Though it's a term that has disappeared in modern football.

It still remains an ideal for those who have watched Italian football.

Many Italian football fans still hope for the return of a "fantasia."

But such a player hasn't appeared yet.

No, they can't appear.

It's not because of their playing style.

"Fantasia" is just a term for a "fantastic player," a "great player."

Of course, players called "fantasia" generally showed a similar playing style.

Prominent examples include "Roberto Baggio" and "Del Piero."

Especially Roberto Baggio, who could be considered the most fitting "fantasia."

A player with a scoring ability of a number 9 and the orchestration skills of a number 10.

A player with dazzling performances and looks, truly fitting the title "star on the field."

That's the "fantasia" Italy desires.

Currently, there is no player in Serie A who has given fans such an enormous shock to be called "fantasia."

Coach Gino Inzaghi looked at the field with a confident expression.

He was certain that Park Minho was close to the perfect form of "fantasia."

Why not "crack" but "fantasia"?

Unlike the practical "crack," a "fantasia" shows romance on the field.

And the player on the field now.

Park Minho, wearing number 24 for Parma, was showing that romance to the fans who loved Parma.

So it was more regrettable.

It was that desperate.

He hoped that this great player would explode his talent not in Parma but in Inter.

"Mino..."

As Coach Gino Inzaghi's unrequited love continued, the first half's 45 minutes passed.

The score was 2-0, with Inter in the lead.

But on the field, Park Minho was quietly smiling.

Even though Parma's players had dazed expressions, Parma's "fantasia" was genuinely smiling brightly.

[Group Chat]

-RealMilan: Aaaah! It's here! It's here! It's here! Nerazzurri! We are here! Nerazzurri! We are crazy like you! Nerazzurri!

-LoveMilan: Ah; don't spam the chat with chants.

-KingOfJuve: Parma players can't connect the ball to Minho... Our Minho is struggling alone.

-Roberto: Ah... This isn't how our team usually plays... Why are our guys playing like this suddenly?

-RealMilan: Yeah, last season was just a flukeㅋㅋㅋ Honestly, if our Minho hadn't exploded with potential, we would have won that gameㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-LoveMilan: The first half ends like this.

-KingOfJuve: 2-0... Wonder how they'll come out in the second halfㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

As the first half ended with a 2-0 score.

Park Minho and his friends' group chat became lively.

And just before the first half ended, Park Minho's face was caught on camera.

He was smiling brightly, oddly enough.

-Roberto: Our Mino is smiling?

-LoveMilan: What the... Why is he smiling?

-KingOfJuve: Suddenly got chills... Is he planning a big comeback in the second half?

-LoveMilan: Smiling while the team is losing? This is such a cliché.

-Monica: As expected, Mino! His smiling face is so handsome!

While everyone showed puzzlement.

Only one person expressed a sense of foreboding.

-RealMilan: Really bad feeling!

-RealMilan: No... This is really not good.

-RealMilan: Yeah! Our Minho must be smiling because he's greatly disappointed in Parma's performance. That's it!

Just as the group chat was buzzing.

Korean overseas football fans who were watching the Serie A broadcast also showed a heated reaction.

-Park Minho is smiling?

-Leave him be... He must be having a good dream.

-ㅋㅋㅋ Finally, Minho's skills are all revealed to be a fluke?

-Wow... It's amazing. There are people who criticize an attacker who scored 91 goals in Serie B? Bbooshung Ppaoshung!

-Yeah, Parma will get completely destroyed by Inter and then their form will dropㅋㅋㅋ

While people were chattering excitedly.

With halftime over, the broadcast camera captured the players entering the field for the second half.

It was a relaxed atmosphere. Despite that, Inter’s players did not become complacent.

On the other hand, Parma's players still seemed unable to shake off their stiff expressions.

Except for one player.

* * *

There are games like this.

When the whole team feels like they are stuck in a quagmire.

This can happen even in amateur football.

Usually, it happens when the guys who recently won a big match get overconfident and drink too much.

Well, Parma wasn't to that extent.

But they were somewhat complacent.

That’s why I waited patiently.

Honestly, if I had gone all out in the first half, I could have made up at least one goal.

But after exhausting all my energy, there was a high chance I would just be a scarecrow standing idly in the second half.

So, I conserved my energy while participating in defense.

Exactly three sprints.

If I could sprint three times with all my might, I was confident I could at least tie the game.

A fierce and intense game.

While the first half was one-sided with us getting beaten, the second half was different.

Our coach substituted the underperforming right-winger Fabian with Dennis Man, and finally, the ball started connecting to me.

Just that much put pressure on Inter.

Honestly, I wondered if I was really this kind of player.

But thinking back, the craziest player in Parma since last year until now has been ‘me.’

It meant the opposing defense had no choice but to be very tense.

Anyway.

As the ball started to connect to me a bit more, Inter seemed to drop their line more than expected.

They seemed to want to end the game like this.

But I had no intention of letting that happen.

Today's game.

In the 3-4-3 formation, I played as a fairly low-positioned attacking midfielder with a free role in the second line.

In the first half, I was practically a ghost because the ball didn't come to me.

But this time, it was different.

‘Found it.’

I found the opponent’s mistake.

A slightly long pass.

If I rush in now, I can intercept it.

Even before I was sure, I started running.

It was in the realm of instinct.

-Oh! Riccardo Bastoni’s pass is a bit long! Pietro Barella...! Ah! Mino! Mino intercepted the ball!

-Mino! He starts running! He begins to create cracks in the tense second half!

As soon as I intercepted the ball, I ran forward and made a long pass to Kenneth on the opposite side.

“Mino!”

As Kenneth shouted, I broke into the center, and for the first time in a while, Kenneth's perfect pass landed at my feet.

Wow! Kenneth!

At least for today, his passes were sharp.

Usually, the passes would be slightly long or short.

This time, it was precise.

As soon as Kenneth's pass landed at my feet, which were cutting diagonally, I swung my left foot powerfully as if I had been waiting.

Normally, I would rely on higher chances and carry the ball a bit further, but unfortunately, in today’s game, relying on those higher chances would likely get me stopped by the well-prepared opponent.

Didn’t they say they analyzed me?

Expecting to play normally against such an opponent would likely get me stopped.

So.

Now, trusting my instincts was the right choice.

Today’s first shot.

I just hit it hard.

Bang!

Not only Inter’s defense but also the goalkeeper couldn’t predict the fantastic goal that curved like a snake and shook the net.

Swoosh!

Naturally, as I slid on the turf and rolled towards the away stands, Parma's fans chanted my name.

“Waaaaaah!”

“Minooooooo!”

“Park! Mino! Park! Mino!”

“Parmaaaaaa!”

I couldn't help but smile at the almost manic reactions of the fans.

Are they that happy?

Then I should score one more.

No, let’s score two more.

They’re so happy...

I can’t be stingy and just score one.

* * *

-Wooooooow! Fantastic goooooooal!

-Minooooooo! Parma catches up to 2-1! Incredible! Truly incredible!

-It was beautiful! A quick breakthrough! A clean connection! And finally, a mesmerizing shot! Perfect!

-A fantasia has appeared in Parma!

Coach Gino Inzaghi looked at Park Minho with an enchanted expression, even though he had conceded a goal.

Ah, yes!

That player is definitely a fantasia.

With just individual creativity and free-spirited play, he shattered the shield of last season’s champions, Inter.

How could anyone not love such a player as an Italian?

He is truly a player close to a dream.

“Damn it!”

At the same time, he couldn’t help but curse the stupid Chinese owners.

Despite winning the league for two consecutive years, those foolish pigs cut the championship bonuses again.

Those shameless people who treated Inter like a product for their benefit while drowning in debt.

Those fools who responded lukewarmly to his suggestion to sign Park Minho.

All kinds of curses came out.

But.

Even in such a situation.

Even if he had to kneel to those pig-like owners.

Coach Gino Inzaghi wanted to bring the fantastic player Park Minho to the Inter club.

Fantasia.

The ideal he had dreamt of was right before his eyes.

Waaaaah!

Booo!

And then cheers and boos echoed.

Another goal was scored.

It was Park Minho again.

Thwack!

-Goooooaaaal!

-Minooooooo! A brace! This is it! This is it! Waaaaaaah! Just like ‘Roberto Baggio,’ Mino is playing football alone! He finally scores the equalizer!

-Parma’s fantasia saves the team from crisis! The score is now tied at 2-2!

-Fantastic play! Fantastic goal! Mino breathes life into Parma’s football!

“I will bring him. Absolutely.”

Coach Gino Inzaghi clenched his fist.

With the ideal right in front of him.

There was no room for reason.

Only romance remained.
