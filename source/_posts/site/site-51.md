## 18. Coppa Italia and an Unbeaten Season (5)

- The score is 2 to 1, Parma takes the lead again!

- There have been so many goals since the first half!

A little over 20 minutes into the first half.

Parma started to take the lead again.

The moment Kenneth scored a goal.

Parma's fans chanted his name loudly, celebrating their youth academy product.

Kenneth! Kenneth! Kenneth!

Kenneth's goal, seen as the club's future, gave Parma fans a great sense of pride.

Moreover, the player who assisted this goal was Park Minho.

Both players made their debuts at Parma.

It was already a delight that Park Minho, who debuted by scoring unexpectedly as a spectator, was playing, and Kenneth, who scored over 20 goals since debuting in the second half of the season, was also performing today.

It meant that the Parma fans who visited the stadium today couldn't help but go wild.

Of course, it's uncertain whether Park Minho and Kenneth will perform as well next season.

But there was no reason to downplay the results they achieved now.

“Minhooooooo!”

“Give us the championship trophy!”

“Waaaaah!”

Parma fans continued to cheer.

It was a frenzy that even Rossoneri fans would be tired of.

- Goooaaaal!

- The score is back to square one!

- Samuel Pellegrini's goooaaaal! The score is back to 2 to 2!

Milan's goal in the 27th minute of the first half.

Even though they caught up, AC Milan players didn't release their tense expressions.

- Mino! Minooooo!

- Mino drives past Gerard Hernandez into the center! He makes Matthew Tomori look like a fool with a heel chop!

- He's fast! He's fast!

- He takes a shoooot!

Park Minho fiercely aimed for the goal again.

AC Milan's defense barely blocked Park Minho's chilling shot and managed to avert the crisis.

“Jeremy, runnnnn!”

“Jeremy!”

Milan's counterattack began.

Jeremy Saelemaekers, who caught the ball, broke through Parma's right side with incredible speed.

Explosive pace.

“Return!”

Jeremy, who sharply beat the defender.

He gracefully received the pass to the center with his right foot like an elegant swan.

Without losing any speed, he bypassed Lautaro Valencia and took a shot.

Giovanni threw his body, but...

Thud!

It wasn't a shot that could be blocked.

As Jeremy Saelemaekers scored his second goal of the match, Milan fans finally erupted in cheers.

- Goooaaaal!

- Jeremy! Jeremy makes it happen! Truly amazing! Milan succeeds in turning the game around to 3 to 2!

- A fantastic goal! A fantastic breakthrough!

The field was still pouring with rain.

Thanks to that, the defenses of both teams were helpless against the breakthroughs of the fast players.

In a typical situation.

The moment they allowed the reversal, Parma's players would inevitably be in a hurry.

But not now.

Their gazes naturally turned to Park Minho.

Santiago shouted to Park Minho as he returned to his position.

“Mino!”

“What?”

“Get it done!”

“Get what done?”

“A hat-trick! Do it!”

Park Minho smiled as he watched Santiago properly use the Korean he had taught him.

“Sure, if you want it, I'll do it.”

There was still plenty of game time left.

He was confident he could do it.

* * *

Beep!

“Damn!”

Vigo Kjær, who broke the flow with a foul, was angry.

A direct free-kick chance in the 43rd minute of the first half.

The distance was very close, around 20 meters.

- Ah! A foul here! A free-kick chance for Parma just before the first half ends.

- Vigo Kjær receives a yellow card.

- It's a good position to aim directly. Especially since Mino has scored quite a few goals from free-kick situations!

It's a good position.

I could see Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan shouting as he coordinated Milan's defensive wall.

I needed a shot that barely cleared that height.

“Should I try ‘that’ I saw before?”

I had some bad memories, so I had downplayed it a bit.

But during his prime, that player was the one everyone thought of when it came to free-kicks.

“How should I kick it?”

“Try a knuckleball.”

He nodded as he listened to my words.

Knowing I was aiming directly, Milan's defenders signaled to other players to make it hard to recognize.

This time, I planned to run in without raising my hand.

Beep!

The referee's whistle blew.

I exhaled slowly.

So...

Did ‘Ronaldo’ do it like this?

Ta-ta-ta-tat!

After a quick run, I swung my left foot.

The ball moved along the trajectory I had in mind.

Goalkeeper Mike Maignan read the trajectory and dove, but the ball, which had no spin, suddenly changed its movement.

Thud!

As soon as I saw the ball unexpectedly curve and hit the net, I ran to the broadcast camera.

I slid, sending a spray of water towards the broadcast camera, and then grabbed the wet camera and shouted.

“Wait! Just one more goal to go!”

While I returned to my position after the celebration, Parma fans started singing my cheer song again.

I felt an omnipotent power as if I had become a real god.

Parma has a god!

His name is Park Minho!

Park Minho! Park Minho!

Parma’s god! Park Minho!

As I thought about wanting to win spectacularly today and play at Parma for just one more year, the thought crossed my mind.

Yeah, I'm Parma’s god.

Why wouldn't I be able to do it?

“I am Parma’s god!”

Seeing me talking to myself with my arms spread wide, my teammate looked at me as if I was half-crazy and subtly distanced himself.

Hey, if you score goals like me, you can go crazy in a good way like this too.

* * *

Halftime.

The moment the first half ended with a 3 to 3 score.

No one was more anxious than the players of Parma or AC Milan.

- I Love Milan: Damn it!

- Roberto: Hahahahahaha

- Real Milan: Hahahahahaha

- King Yuve: Hahahahahaha

A man who did something stupid under the influence of alcohol.

Kim Joosik's eyes were shaking hard.

Park Minho was already performing greatly by scoring 2 goals against the Milan he supported.

Not only was his team losing, but if Park Minho succeeded in the hat-trick, he would have to buy him a car, which was a big problem.

But there was a bigger problem.

- Who was the idiot who made a bet with that monster to buy a car if he succeeded in a hat-trick?

- Mino? Please stop! We'll buy you a car... Please don't score anymore!

- Even a Ferrari! BMW too! Audi too! We'll buy you any car you want! Please!

- Didn't you say you were that monster's friend? Why did you make such a bet with that monster to trouble Rossoneri?

- It's damn ridiculous! It's damn ridiculous!

On the AC Milan community, stories about the 'stupid friend who made a hat-trick bet with Park Minho' were starting to come out.

Some fans even speculated that Park Minho's friend was not a Rossoneri but a damn Bianconeri pretending to be one.

Clearly, AC Milan had been dominating, but now at the end of the first half, the score was 3 to 3.

It was incomprehensible.

AC Milan's defense, which had allowed the least goals in the league, was being torn apart by the Park Minho and Kenneth duo.

On the other hand, AC Milan's attack was missing more good opportunities than expected.

Because of just one player, AC Milan couldn't take the lead despite scoring 3 goals in the first half.

Naturally, the angry Rossoneri fans turned their accusing gaze on the 'friend who made a bet with Park Minho' that he mentioned in an interview.

Kim Joosik was sweating coldly.

He suddenly remembered revealing to his colleagues a few days ago that he was friends with Park Minho.

And soon his disaster arrived.

- Bastard: Joosik! It's not you, right?

“Damn it! I'm really screwed!”

Kim Joosik swallowed hard.

Seeing the text from his despised boss who usually bullied him, he couldn't help but sell out his beloved friend.

Then he muttered to himself.

“Sorry... Seongyeong!”

- Kim Joosik: One of my friends is a Bianconeri, and he pretended to be a Rossoneri! I just found out too.

But I have to survive.

Kim Joosik closed his eyes tightly.

A peculiar sense of guilt pricked his heart.

But on the other hand, he felt a sense of relief from staying safe.

However.

His lie didn't work.

Five minutes later, his hateful boss called.

The boss scolded him harshly, saying AC Milan was suffering because of him.

With a shriveled face, he let out a short curse.

“Damn it.”

* * *

“Screw it! Nothing matters!”

“Just stop Mino! If you stop Mino, we don't need any damn transfer funds! We'll win Serie A and the Europa League!”

Our coach's excited voice could be heard in the locker room as he talked to someone.

I could roughly guess who it was.

It must be our club owner.

The coach, with an awkward expression, soon entered the locker room and praised the situation of ending the first half 3 to 3.

And in the second half, he instructed us to hold onto the opponent's legs a little more persistently.

“Our goal is to make a one-goal difference and lie down. Did you see the field when the first half ended?”

Yeah, unlike the beginning of the first half, the center part was not well-drained and had become muddy.

In other words, it was the perfect condition for swamp football.

Moreover, both teams had exhausted a lot of energy fighting for control in the center.

In the second half, there would definitely be several mistakes from the tired players in the center.

Our coach asked us to exploit that part.

“Score one more goal than the opponent.”

“And lie down.”

“Go into a deep sleep! Got it?”

Sleeping on a rain-soaked field...

It sounds strangely tempting.

“Great! Go show them! Let those Rossoneri bastards know who we are!”

With those final words, the players stepped out of the locker room.

In 45 minutes of the second half, the winner would be decided.

It seemed the Milan players were just as prepared as we were, their eyes showing determination.

Swoosh!

It felt like the rain had lessened compared to before.

The field was still muddy.

The central grass, messed up in the first half, had become muddy and didn't look easy to play on.

But the side lanes were still in good shape.

The fast players still had energy left.

The deciding factor for the winner of the second half would likely be the side lanes.

“Phew...”

After lightly stretching my legs, I entered the field.

The humidity seemed better than before.

My condition was good.

Despite running so hard in the first half, I had plenty of energy left.

Then the second half began.

The pressure wasn't as intense as in the first half.

AC Milan was also cautious.

They were wary of the variables of a rain match.

But that didn't mean they were playing defensively.

AC Milan started utilizing their fast players positioned on the sides, which was their strength.

At the same time, a marker was assigned to me.

“Hello?”

“Yeah, hello.”

Bruno Campos.

He was also a client of Leo like me.

He smiled at me.

I thought he might be a pervert and subtly avoided him.

“Mino!”

Santiago's pass flew in.

But it was a bit strong.

Probably because the wet field made him pass stronger than usual.

“Oops!”

The ball bounced a bit too much.

Bruno Campos didn't miss it and pushed me hard to steal the ball.

Blocked by the wall-like Bruno Campos, I had no choice but to turn the ball back.

He was a tougher opponent than I thought.

It seemed he had researched me a lot.

But I didn't feel particularly pressured.

“Mino!”

Another pass connected to me.

Looking at Bruno Campos blocking my way, I felt the urge to break through him.

Tap-tap!

I slowly dribbled the ball forward.

Bruno Campos watched me closely, lowering his body and carefully observing my feet and upper body.

Hoo...

I didn't stay still either.

After taking a deep breath.

I started moving slowly again.

Now, how should I break through?
