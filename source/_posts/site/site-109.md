## 41. Boxing Day (2)

Thanks to the fistfight between two spectators, an unexpected cooling break of about five minutes occurred.

Of course, since it was too cold to call it a cooling break, it was just a brief moment to catch our breath while drinking some water.

The game resumed.

Arsenal scored the first goal and immediately sat back to defend against Manchester United's offensive.

There was still plenty of time left, so Manchester United's players moved diligently to break through our defense, albeit more calmly.

- Ronaldo with the header!

- Ah! The ball goes high over the bar! Manchester United created a good chance, but the finish was a bit disappointing this time as well.

- Perhaps because it's Boxing Day, the movements of both Arsenal and Manchester United players aren't looking great.

Despite the rotation, the fatigue was visible on the players' faces.

The same was true for Manchester United.

In fact, they looked even more exhausted than us.

But being professionals, the players gritted their teeth and started pushing themselves on the field.

The game continued to be very tight.

Even though it was 1-0, Manchester United's players showed surprising patience as they tried to shake our flanks.

- Manchester United continues to create good chances. But... Arsenal's defense seems more solid.

- The finishing is consistently disappointing. Especially, Ronaldo's shots today are really off.

Manchester United had shown really good form in their previous match against Southampton, winning 2-1.

No matter how strong Arsenal, the league leaders, were, it was thought that Manchester United, led by Ronaldo, could sufficiently trouble our defense.

However,

Their finishing was strangely clumsy.

Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho kept missing their chances throughout today's game.

On our side, Junseo hyung, who was positioned on the opposite flank, also couldn't seize any good opportunities today.

Mario Fernandez, who moved up to the attacking midfield, occasionally created some threatening moments.

If Ronaldo was struggling with his finishing, conversely, Arsenal's attacks were oddly disjointed.

It seemed that the biggest issue was Derrick de Jong.

Manchester United had spent a fortune to bring Derrick, who was doing well at Barcelona.

Because of him, Arsenal's midfield was struggling both offensively and defensively.

'As expected... Is it too much for Jake?'

Jake Francis, who was playing as a defensive midfielder today, was having a tough time against Derrick de Jong.

It was thanks to Bruno Campos covering for him that the game remained tight; otherwise, it might have already been a draw.

"Minho! Drop back and help with the attack!"

Following the coach's shout, I reluctantly moved to the center.

Anyway, unless the ball reached my feet, Arsenal's remaining attack route was only long balls.

Except for aiming at Lorenzo's head, I had to move a bit more, and as soon as I moved to the center, Derrick de Jong stuck to my side.

"Do you want to join me at Barça later?"

"Does Barça have that kind of money?"

"Nope."

I heard he had a strong attachment to Barcelona and didn't want to leave, but he had to join Manchester United because Barça's finances were too bad.

Maybe that's why?

He looked quite bitter.

Anyway.

As I moved deeper into the center, Derrick de Jong could no longer put strong pressure on Jake Francis.

Thanks to that, the young regista whom Arsenal cherished barely managed to pass the ball to my feet.

As soon as I got the ball, Derrick de Jong stuck to me.

Honestly, I've faced many players one-on-one, but there aren't many who put this much pressure on me.

Ah, Kyle van Dijk was simply a defensive god.

I vaguely understood why Liverpool could consistently challenge for the league title for quite a while.

If Manchester United had such a defender, maybe they could have won another trophy.

- Minho! Slowly dribbling and penetrating.

- Derrick de Jong persistently blocks Minho's breakthrough! But Minho! Dribbles past Derrick de Jong!

That doesn't mean he is an impossible opponent to break through.

Just a rather annoying one.

As soon as I got past Derrick de Jong, James McGuire rushed to block my way.

Of course, once again, I neatly slotted the ball into the open space, and this time Bukayo Saka received my pass and took a shot.

- Goooooooal!

- Bukayo Saka! Arsenal scores their second goal, extending the lead to 2-0 just before the end of the first half!

- If James McGuire had come out a bit faster... He could have cut off Minho's pass, but this will be a regretful moment for Manchester United.

Indeed, James McGuire's problem is his slow pace.

This time, Bukayo Saka slid dramatically towards the away fans, clenching his fist.

The Gooners who followed us to Old Trafford cheered wildly for Bukayo Saka.

"This is it! Come on!"

"Saka! You're the best!"

"Let's keep this going! Arsenal!"

On the contrary, the home fans of Manchester United, who filled Old Trafford, hurled criticisms at James McGuire for his poor performance.

After Bukayo Saka's goal, the first half ended with a score of 2-0.

* * *

Manchester United's manager, Helge, thought.

The performance wasn't bad.

In fact, there were parts where they dominated against Arsenal, so he was confident of winning this League Cup quarter-final.

But what came back to him was a score of 2-0 in the first half.

Arsenal was solid.

They calmly blocked all of Manchester United's attacks and scored two goals with sharp counterattacks.

If it weren't for goalkeeper Jordi de Gea, they would have been losing 4-0 instead of 2-0.

"Ronaldo isn't doing well."

In fact, Manager Helge had planned to manage Ronaldo's condition from December.

Considering the EPL's particularly packed schedule in December, he should have benched Ronaldo in a few earlier matches.

But the Manchester United legend didn't agree.

He greedily demanded to keep playing, and Manager Helge had no choice but to keep using him as a starter.

Fortunately, Ronaldo maintained good form, possibly because it was his final season, and performed consistently in all December matches.

However,

In front of Arsenal, who had rotated their players well and conserved energy, the tired Ronaldo was just a dull blade.

It couldn't be helped.

At Manchester United, the board had more power than the manager.

Ronaldo had more fame than Manager Helge.

So even though he planned to bench Ronaldo in the second half,

In the end, he had to sub out Junseo Shin and put in Armi Pino.

He couldn't easily give up on the fame and expectations that Ronaldo carried.

Not just the fans, but the board, manager, coaches, and players all had no choice but to believe in Ronaldo and wait.

As a result, Junseo Shin didn't look pleased.

Despite Ronaldo's poor finishing, he, who focused on connecting plays throughout the first half, was subbed out.

At least the manager personally explained why he made such a decision, so his anger was quelled; otherwise, Junseo Shin would have made a scene in the locker room.

After spending a productive halftime, Manchester United's players returned to the field.

- Manchester United has drawn their sword.

- They've subbed out Shin and put in Armi Pino. This is a somewhat unexpected choice.

- It seems Manager Helge wants to give Ronaldo more chances.

- He believes Ronaldo won't disappoint Manchester United.

However,

Contrary to his expectations, Manchester United played even worse in the second half.

With Junseo Shin, who focused on connecting plays on the flank, subbed out, Armi Pino, who took his place on the flank, couldn't handle Arsenal's fullback, Takehiro Tomiyasu.

Additionally, with Arsenal having more room at the back, they gradually used Jake Francis to penetrate Manchester United's danger zone through Park Minho.

Naturally, Manchester United's defense had a hard time.

Park Minho, who was fast and smooth in connecting plays, ran rampant, making it difficult to contain him.

At least Derrick de Jong moved defensively without joining the attack, preventing any goals.

Nonetheless, Park Minho's movements were becoming more aggressive.

Manchester United's players thought Park Minho would soon go for a goal fiercely.

However,

Having already recorded two assists, Park Minho was determined to achieve a hat-trick of assists.

- Minho! Passes the ball and turns to move forward!

- Lorenzo Lupo! Returns the ball to Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho avoids Luke Shaw and connects a long pass to the center!

- Jake Francis shoots! Goooooooal! Jake Francis, who came up to a high position, is rewarded for his dedicated movements!

- Arsenal! Extends the lead to 3-0 against Manchester United just 12 minutes into the second half!

The score difference extended to 3-0.

Manager Helge clutched his head.

Ronaldo furiously scolded the players.

Lastly, Jake Francis, who scored the goal, ran to share his joy with Park Minho, who had achieved a hat-trick of assists.

[Arsenal advances to the League Cup semi-finals! Beats Manchester United 3-0!]

[A game marred by fan fights! The winner is Arsenal!]

[Ronaldo and Park Minho, both goalless! But the game's content and result clearly favor Park Minho!]

[Minho, the MOM of the match with a hat-trick of assists!]

[Manchester United's Manager Helge: "It wasn't good. Despite having more chances, our finishing was not as clean as the opponent's."]

[A heated argument in Manchester United's locker room after the game?]

[Arsenal remains undefeated until the end of Boxing Day! Can they replicate the 03-04 season?]

With the end of the League Cup quarter-finals, Boxing Day was over.

If we can handle the league match against Manchester United well in the New Year, we can return to a normal rotation.

Back in London, I smiled brightly as I saw the young players gaining more confidence at the training ground.

At the beginning of the season, the young players who had a hard time with the veterans were now approaching them to ask questions.

It felt like the atmosphere was finally set.

When I played at Parma, we achieved good results when we maintained such an atmosphere, so I felt hopeful.

"Minho, look at this. I've been practicing this new skill... I plan to show it in the New Year match against Manchester United."

Amani Richards, who was lazier than a slacker, was unusually enthusiastic about training.

He showed off a freestyle football trick he recently learned in front of me.

"Minho, this is difficult even for you. It's a trick that Mr. Woo, known for his football tricks, posted on social media."

He then demonstrated the trick in front of me, which indeed seemed quite challenging.

But it looked fun enough, so I gestured to Amani to pass me the ball.

I said I wanted to try it too, and Amani gave me a smug look.

"No matter how good you are, Minho, this trick isn't something you can master easily just by seeing it once."

It didn't seem that hard, so I gave it a try.

Move my right foot like this, quickly hit with the left, and finish by balancing on the left foot with the right.

It didn't seem like something I couldn't do.

"I can do it."

Amani stared at me in disbelief.

Annoyed by his look, I made sure he couldn't slack off until the end of the training.

Next time, bring an even harder trick.

Rookie.
