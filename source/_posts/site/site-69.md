## 24. Qatar World Cup (5)

-Monica: Is it really possible that England will win the World Cup this time?

-Monica: My heart is swelling with pride!

-Monica: If England wins the World Cup, do you think Arsenal can win too?

In the Round of 16, which started after all the group stage matches were over, England showed overwhelming performance against Australia.

To the extent that even die-hard Arsenal fans had high hopes, England crushed Australia with their dominant performance.

It seemed to perfectly fulfill Monica's England hype.

[Italy! 1-0 victory over Nigeria!]

[Croatia! 2-1 victory over Ukraine! A fantastic free-kick goal!]

[Portugal! Advances to the quarterfinals with a winning goal from Ronaldo!]

[Belgium! Narrow 3-2 victory over Jamaica!]

One by one, the teams advancing to the quarterfinals were decided.

The dominance of European teams continued.

Where is Brazil, you ask?

They were shockingly eliminated in the group stage, caught by Italy and Ukraine.

Naturally, Italy was in a half-crazed state.

The video message Roberto sent showed Parma filled with Italian flags waving wildly.

There were even flares burning.

Some people were running around in just their underwear, body-painted in the colors of the Italian flag.

It was enough to give me goosebumps.

Seeing an old man running around in just his underwear was a bit of an eyesore, to be honest.

Anyway.

The Netherlands, Germany, Uruguay, Brazil.

Teams expected to advance to the quarterfinals were eliminated en masse.

Germany was knocked out by Argentina.

Uruguay was hit and eliminated by Wales.

-BbaenJil: Minho! Did you see it?

-BbaenJil: I scored a goal against Germany!

-BbaenJil: Germany was eliminated because of the equalizer I scored!

Santiago, who continued to play as a substitute, seemed to be performing well, continuously getting opportunities.

And he scored the equalizer in the 43rd minute of the second half against Germany, knocking them out of the group stage.

He was so happy about it.

He still kept sending me messages about it.

Santiago, who showed a decent performance in the subsequent match against Mexico, was saddened to hear that Argentina would face the winner of the France-Wales match in the quarterfinals.

Even I thought that France was really crazy this season.

But still, with Messi, who knows?

-Monica: Seriously! This World Cup is the moment! Germany is out, Brazil is out, the Netherlands is out too!

Seeing Monica so excited, I felt a mischievous urge.

So I quietly asked.

-Park Minho: If you had to choose between England winning the World Cup and Park Minho transferring to Arsenal, what would you pick?

-Monica: ?

-Monica: Definitely Minho transferring to Arsenal!

-Park Minho: Huh?

I was taken aback.

I never imagined she would answer so firmly.

-Monica: Italy or England will eventually win the World Cup someday, but Arsenal is most likely to end up with no titles without Minho.

-Monica: So, are you coming to Arsenal?

-Monica: If you transfer to Arsenal, I've already arranged 101 promises the club can support! :)

As expected, Monica is all about Arsenal.

I quietly closed the chat window and lay down on the bed.

* * *

Spain.

It sounds like a name that should be good at football, but their World Cup performance has not been as good as expected.

To be precise, when compared to their reputation, their World Cup results were quite poor.

After finishing fourth in the 1950 World Cup, they had not reached the semifinals for 60 years until 2010, despite having a great squad and tactics.

They managed to save face by winning the 2010 World Cup, but were eliminated in the group stage of the 2014 Brazil World Cup and in the Round of 16 of the 2018 Russia World Cup against the host nation.

Still, they were undeniably a strong team.

Given that Korea had recorded 2 draws and 4 losses against Spain in 6 matches, it was expected to be a tough match.

One of those draws was the famous quarterfinal match in 2002.

There were all sorts of comments about it being a game won by bad calls or luck.

My father, who watched the game back then, said that both Spain and Korea benefited a lot from bad calls, so Spain just lost because they didn't play well.

In other words, both teams benefited from the referee's decisions.

Anyway.

We had a meeting before the match against Spain.

We had a lot of concerns about how to play against Spain, but judging by their performance in the group stage, the first thought that came to mind was, "Huh? We might have a chance."

Their reputation was certainly impressive.

They had a squad full of incredible players and solid tactics under coach Isaak Enrique.

But it was really strange.

Spain seemed a bit weaker than the Netherlands.

Of course, that didn't mean they were an easy opponent.

They advanced with 3 wins in Group G.

Could such a team be considered weak?

However, if asked whether they were a perfect team, I could confidently shake my head.

One thing that caught my eye was that Spain struggled to win all their Group G matches 1-0.

Coach Pedro pointed this out too.

"Spain has a more serious attacking issue than the Netherlands. You can see it in this data."

The data Coach Pedro showed us.

The Spain shown there was a team suffering from a more severe striker drought than the Netherlands, not the strong Spain we knew.

Despite having two forwards, Hugo Morata and Gerard Mañas, Spain had only scored 3 goals in the Qatar World Cup finals.

Their solid defense led by Ramos was the reason they won 3 matches. If their defense had crumbled with such a weak attack, Uruguay might have advanced to the Round of 16 instead of Spain.

"In this situation, Ramos and Azpilicueta are injured and cannot play in the Round of 16."

Good news.

Of course, we couldn't be too happy about the opponent's injury, but we couldn't ignore the fact that two key defenders of Spain were injured.

However, we couldn't let our guard down.

Spain's midfield and second line were filled with players who were considered the best talents ever.

"Spain? Could they be tougher than France?"

"They're the ones who managed to hold France to a 3-2 score."

"Right! We can do this!"

"Come on! Come on! We beat the Netherlands, can we really lose badly to Spain? Let's fight hard and drag it to extra time, just like in 2002, and go to a penalty shootout!"

A team that made it to the knockout stage meant they had the basic strength.

Yeah, Korea had the strength to achieve a good result against Spain.

"Alright! We can do it!"

"Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!"

"Just like in 2002, we'll beat Spain and move on to the next stage!"

On match day.

The team's atmosphere was bright.

Well, it's much better than being gloomy.

-Qatar World Cup Knockout Stage! The match between Korea and Spain begins!

Honestly, I was a bit nervous.

After all, it was Spain.

I could definitely feel that they had prepared a lot to stop me and senior Shin Junseo.

About 5 minutes into the first half?

I felt that Spain's defense was tighter than I thought and started to worry.

To be honest, the core of Korea's attack could be said to be just me and senior Junseo.

In addition, Sangbin and Yongcheol consistently contributed to our attack points.

Spain was pressing hard to break this connection and was pushing us.

I could definitely say that every part of Spain was superior to Korea.

But the reason we were maintaining a 0-0 score was due to Spain's severe striker drought.

-Gerard Mañas! He misses it!

-Oh! Spain's attacking line continues to show poor finishing in this World Cup!

-Korea! Barely maintaining a 0-0 balance thanks to Spain's poor performance!

A little over 10 minutes into the first half.

Gerard Mañas, who had recorded 6 shots, was showing such poor finishing that it felt like he had stuffed 20 sweet potatoes into the hearts of Spanish fans.

A nearby Spanish fan, waving the Spanish flag, was so frustrated that he shouted at Gerard, "Just shoot! Don't drag it out, just shoot!"

Of course, it wasn't just Spain that was frustrated.

Korea faced the worst situation as well.

-Ah! Shin Junseo receives a yellow card! This means he can't play in the quarterfinals due to accumulated warnings.

-Overall, you can feel the fatigue of the Korean team.

The team's pace had slowed down.

It meant their stamina had significantly dropped.

There was nothing we could do.

If we hadn't run ourselves to death against France and the Netherlands, it might have been us, not the Netherlands, that got eliminated.

My legs were tired too.

I struggled more than I thought to get past Spain's left-back, Jose Arias.

"You're slower than I thought."

Watching Jose Arias trying to trash talk confidently, I left a short remark.

"I don't speak Spanish."

In fact, I could understand some of it.

The two languages were similar yet different.

Pretending not to understand Spanish, I subtly provoked him in Italian, and he ended up committing a foul.

Beeeeeep!

-Jose Arias! That was a very rough foul!

-There was no need for such a tackle in that position……. It was a very rash action!

Idiot.

That's why defenders need to be cool-headed.

In that sense, the match against the Netherlands, where I scored a hat-trick, was the toughest.

Kyle van Dijk's play, which didn't easily fall for any tricks, was still vivid in my mind.

On the other hand, this Spanish rookie was nothing special.

-Park Minho prepares for a free kick.

-Park Minho had some success with free kicks in this World Cup.

"Hoo……."

I took a deep breath.

Then I rushed forward quickly.

Bang!

I struck the ball hard, and it curved swiftly towards the goalpost.

Eusebio Simon, who was guarding the goal instead of De Gea, dived, but it was futile.

The ball had already curved significantly and hit the far post, shaking the net.

-Goooooooal! Korea! Gooooooal! Park Minho scores the opening goal in the 15th minute of the first half!

-Korea takes the lead against Spain! Amazing!

-Park Minho! Truly! Park Minho!

That's it!

The perfectly curved free kick hit the target.

Thanks to that, Korea started the game against Spain with a good lead in the first half.

Today's game felt really good.

* * *

I take that back.

It didn't feel that good.

The game took an odd turn.

Korea, who had been holding onto the lead I scored in the first half, fell into a series of crises late in the second half.

The first crisis was barely averted when I received a yellow card, but the mistake during injury time was not missed by Hugo Morata, who shook the net, making it 1-1.

Spanish fans were so delighted at that moment.

Anyway, the second half ended with a 1-1 draw.

Due to accumulated warnings, I couldn't play in the quarterfinals after receiving a yellow card late in the second half.

But we couldn't give up on extra time.

We couldn't give up on the title of reaching the quarterfinals for the first time away from home.

I had a desire for honor too.

Extra time was dragging.

Just as we were tired, the opponent's pace had slowed down too.

The ball went back and forth in the center, consuming all the time.

-Now it's the last kicker.

Korea's fifth kicker steps up.

Korea's ace, Shin Junseo.

He stood in front of the ball.

The opponent had missed two chances.

If we score this goal, we secure our place in the quarterfinals.

Junseo took a deep breath and stepped back slowly.

Beeeeeep!

As soon as the referee blew the whistle loudly.

The moment Junseo charged forward and kicked the ball, shaking the net, we cheered like we did when we reached the semifinals in 2002 and rushed towards Junseo.

-Korea! Succeeds in advancing to the quarterfinals away from home for the first time in World Cup history! Amazing! Amazing!

-Ohhhhh! Shin Junseo! He's crying! Korea has achieved an incredible accomplishment!

-Victory against Spain! The team advancing to the quarterfinals after the penalty shootout is Korea!

The celebrating Korean players.

In contrast, the Spanish players sat down and cried.

But we couldn't just be happy.

Junseo and I were ineligible to play in the quarterfinals against England due to accumulated warnings.

[A miracle happens again!]

[Korea succeeds in advancing to the quarterfinals away from home for the first time in history!]

[The fantastic history of advancing to the quarterfinals created by Shin Junseo and Park Minho!]

[A happy Korea! But the 'Shin-Park Duo' will not be seen in the quarterfinals!]

[The two aces cannot play in the quarterfinals due to accumulated warnings!]

[Can Korea overcome England without the 'Shin-Park Duo'?]

[Comments]

-If it were 2006, they would reset the cards before the Round of 16 lol

-2006? Dude……. How did you even watch that?

-Seriously, without Shin Junseo and Park Minho, the squad feels really weak.

-Why can't the 'Shin-Park Duo' play?

-Since the 2010 South Africa World Cup, they reset the accumulated cards at the quarterfinals instead of the Round of 16.

Even Korean football fans seemed to have partially given up on the next match, satisfied with the achievement of making it to the quarterfinals away from home.

It was understandable.

Two players responsible for 90% of Korea's attack points were sidelined due to accumulated warnings.

-Just……. quietly come back after losing.

-There's no choice. How can we beat England without Shin Junseo and Park Minho?

-To be honest, I'm already satisfied with the performance we showed against the Netherlands and Spain.

As everyone expected.

Korea lost miserably in the quarterfinals.

By a score of 4-0, no less.

[Korea loses 4-0 to England!]

[A mere ordinary Asian team without the 'Shin-Park Duo'! Korea should not be satisfied with making it to the quarterfinals!]

[There were significant achievements, but Korea needs to strengthen its defense and find strikers to support the 'Shin-Park Duo'!]

[Korean players shedding tears! But we saw the future in the young players!]

[Coach Pedro, 'I'm so thankful to the players who did their best! I'm really happy with the unexpected achievements we made.']

So, the World Cup ended in a hollow way.

We had achieved a lot.

We achieved more than expected.

But the ending felt oddly like dissipating mist.

"Really……. It's so empty."

It felt like an empty emotion was sweeping through my chest.

It was truly disappointing and left me feeling hollow.

But what could I do?

This is football.
