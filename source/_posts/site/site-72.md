## 26. The Beginning of a Fairy Tale (1)

After the unpleasant first impression, the training began.

Contrary to his disastrous first impression, Joshua showed a rather remarkable performance during training.

I realized something while watching him train.

The words he spoke in front of us were not just bluster.

Perfect passes and ball touches.

To put it nicely, he handled the ball beautifully.

To put it harshly, it was like he was "messing around."

It was as if a comparison to a "butter-laden Swedish Iniesta" would suit his style of play.

If there was a downside, it was that he wasn't very physical and didn't show much aggression in physical fights.

It was to the extent that Marjan, who was in sync with him during a mini-game, got so frustrated that he shouted, "You damn idiot! Stop being so careful!"

Still, it was fortunate that he didn't seem to be completely antisocial.

“This is football, you gorilla.”

“Get lost, you scarecrow.”

Seeing him quickly become friendly with Kenneth and exchange words like that, I felt relieved.

I thought it was a good sign that the new midfielder was blending well into the training.

Honestly, his initial words were a bit off-putting.

The expressions of the coach and the assistant coach seemed fine, and the other players were looking at Joshua with slightly less hostility than before.

But I still found it a bit difficult to adapt.

No, it reminded me of our company's commander.

Seeing Kenneth keep saying "I'm disappointed!" made me feel that way even more.

Could he actually be Korean?

I kept looking at him, but every time our eyes met, he seemed strangely happy.

I got goosebumps and stopped looking at him.

I felt uneasy as if there was another person to be wary of in the shower room.

Anyway.

A new player joined the team, and Simon Sorf, who was part of the team, left for Monaco.

He was disappointed that he hadn't played many games in the first half and wanted to play more games in Monaco.

The transfer market was otherwise quiet.

In the meantime, Parma won 4-2 against Udinese in the 16th round of the league.

[Park Minho! Leading the team to victory with 2 assists!]

[Parma continues to maintain a 5-point gap with second-place Inter after winning the match against Udinese!]

[Newcomer Joshua Fajov's debut match gets a passing grade!]

It was a match where Joshua, who newly took a crucial position in the midfield, properly demonstrated his value.

Of course, since the opponent was the weak team Udinese, it was yet to be proven how well he could handle proper pressure.

Still, it seemed that our coach gave him a passing grade, so he would likely get more frequent appearances.

In the subsequent Super Cup, we faced our second defeat of the season.

The opponent was last year's league champion, Inter, and the coach prepared for the next match by excluding most of the main players.

The result was a 2-0 defeat, as expected.

I was sitting on the bench watching the game, and it seemed that the depth difference between the two teams was still significant.

The opponent also rotated their players, but the performance gap with us was quite noticeable, which was disappointing.

[Group Chat]

-RealMilan: Super Cup win! Yeah! At least we got one trophy this season.

-LoveMilan: It's just the Super Cup, though?

-RealMilan: Yeah, but it still feels good!

-KingYube: Ah... Parma has a lot of good players.

-RealMilan: Honestly, I want Kenneth too.

-LoveMilan: I want the goalkeeper.

The three hardcore fans were having a 100-minute debate about which Parma players to sign, along with complaints about their respective teams' recent disappointing performances.

It's amazing how passionate they are, even though signing them wouldn't make a difference.

Serie A Round 17.

The opponent was Cagliari.

A weak team that barely managed to stay in Serie A last season by finishing 15th in the league, and this year is also struggling to stay in a similar position.

-The ball is connected to Minho!

-Santiago runs down the flank!

-Santiago's crosssss! And Kenneth's headerrr! Goooal!

-Kenneth Marsetico's perfect header!

-Parma takes the lead 1-0 with an early goal in the 12th minute against Cagliari!

It was an easy match.

We scored early in the game.

The opponent didn't even think about sitting back and had to be shaken by our continuous attacks.

The newly joined Joshua also played a part with his military-style football.

His passes were truly amazing, but since he didn't move around much, his partner, Perelle Kisassini, had to run like crazy to the point of foaming at the mouth.

Fortunately, Perelle's strength was his stamina, so he could cover for Joshua's lack of activity.

If he had been paired with the hot-tempered Marjan, Marjan's hand would have surely landed on the back of Joshua's head.

Marjan can't run that much either.

Besides, Marjan is thirty-three years old, so he can't run like a rookie.

Anyway.

Parma firmly controlled the game.

Even the midfield battle that Cagliari was somewhat confident in was well managed with Joshua's excellent passes, and the attack was freer than expected.

-Minho! Shootsss!

-Goooal! Minho finishes the ball flicked by Kenneth, and the score now extends to 2-0!

I easily picked up the ball flicked by Kenneth.

Really... In sports, physicality is half the battle.

I've been feeling this more and more recently.

The Cagliari defenders are not short, but next to Kenneth, they looked like dwarfs.

After scoring, I looked around at our players.

Moai statue-like striker and a slick guy.

A coward who looks like an Italian gangster, a corpse without positioning, and a commander playmaker...

Not just physicality, but there are a lot of truly unique characters on this team.

How did such characters end up on the same team?

A lot of thoughts seemed to cross my mind.

* * *

[Parma! 4-1 Victory Against Cagliari!]

[Newly Joined Joshua! Establishing a New Offensive Pattern in Parma's Football!]

[Joshua Shows Both Clear Strengths and Weaknesses!]

Joshua thought.

The moment he was inserted into Parma's football.

It became truly beautiful football.

Seeing the players embrace the beautiful football he advocated, he smiled broadly.

'My football is perfect.'

The match against Cagliari that proved it was perfect.

Moreover, he blended well into the team.

Joshua was confident that most of his teammates were captivated by his football.

However, despite becoming quite friendly with many teammates, there were three players he couldn't get close to.

First, Marjan Kurtic.

This old man constantly interfered with Joshua's beautiful football whenever he had the chance.

'What? Run a bit more? That's not beautiful.'

When he responded like this, Marjan's palm would sharply strike the back of his head.

And he couldn't fight back.

How could he stand up to that menacing face?

The same went for the second player, Filippo Asnelli.

Honestly, when he first joined the team, Joshua wondered why an Italian gangster was on the team.

Even though his idol Park Minho said, "Filippo? He's a really nice guy!" Joshua couldn't easily approach him.

Seeing his shaved head and body covered in tattoos, Joshua was reminded of delinquent students he saw in Swedish schools.

The fear etched on his body told him not to even talk to that guy.

Park Minho looked puzzled at Joshua's reaction, but his thoughts didn't change.

His hobby is raising hamsters?

Absolutely unbelievable.

Lastly, Kenneth Marsetico.

He was a player who stood in complete opposition to Joshua's football.

His overwhelming physicality that looked down on beauty was nothing but a severe insult to Joshua.

“Stupid gorilla!”

That man is not a football player.

He's a gorilla playing with a ball.

Anyway.

Except for those three, Joshua got along well with the rest of the team.

So, the atmosphere in Parma was running smoothly.

But after the 18th round match against Sassuolo and before the 19th round match against Lazio, Joshua couldn't help but be enraged.

[Coach Sarri: 'Parma's unbeaten run? It will break soon!']

[Lazio climbs to 3rd place in the league! Confident of victory against Parma!]

[Coach Riccardo Sarri announces he is confident in completely blocking Parma's fantasista!]

“Blasphemy!”

Joshua was furious at Coach Riccardo Sarri's arrogant thoughts.

The pinnacle of beautiful football he believed in.

How dare he think he could block Park Minho, Parma's god?

Joshua was displeased with the opposing coach's confidence.

The ironic part was that he wasn't the only one who thought so.

Kenneth Marsetico, whom Joshua despised, was also highly offended by Lazio's baseless confidence.

“Stupid coach.”

“Challenging the pinnacle that I, Joshua, acknowledge!”

“Lazio will be beaten by Minho.”

“Right! Right! I will promote you from a stupid gorilla to a gorilla with a seven-year-old's IQ. It feels good to be on the same page for once.”

For the first time in a while, the two of them teamed up.

Watching this from a distance, Park Minho was worriedly wondering why the atmosphere seemed off.

* * *

It was strange.

A few days ago, the two were bickering, but suddenly they teamed up and were sticking together throughout training.

Lazio, whom we were facing for the first time this season, was 3rd in the league, just 2 points ahead of 4th place Juventus.

Led by the famous 'Sarri-ball' coach Riccardo Sarri, Lazio had a disappointing last season but was showing their true football this season.

Mixing the traits of Manchester City's coach Guardiola and Liverpool's coach Klopp, his football was sharp enough to make me wary.

Especially seeing his tactical philosophy of preparing 33 different set-piece patterns, I couldn't help but be impressed.

It meant he was doing a lot of preparation for me, right?

I thought it would definitely be a tough opponent.

But...

I can understand why Kenneth and Joshua are acting like that, but why is Monica so angry?

-Monica: How dare they claim they can block Minho!

-Monica: You can't block a god!

-Monica: And one day, he will win the treble with Arsenal and make me ascend to heaven!

I may join Arsenal one day, but Monica doesn't seem to know that it might not be while I'm young.

Honestly, I could join in my late thirties, but Monica seemed to have a strong belief that I would join Arsenal today.

Looking at this... Isn't the real fanatic not Kenneth or Joshua but Monica?

-Roberto: Yeah, Arsenal is 10th in the league.

-Roberto: Nearing Serie A victory > Struggling to even make it to the Europa Conference League.

-Roberto: Our Minho will remain an eternal god at Parma!

Ah, I take it back.

Another fanatic here.

Lately, Roberto has been having the happiest days every day due to Parma's overwhelming performance.

Moreover, seeing all the newly joined players growing well under Coach Alain Lavagne's guidance, he was even securing the future.

It was inevitable that his pride would soar.

-Monica: Yeah, without Minho, half the team's goals would drop, full of bubbles!

-Roberto: So where's Arsenal's coach?

-Monica: We'll take your coach.

-Roberto: Coach Alain is a lifetime coach at Parma.

They were fervently biting and tearing at each other.

This was strangely entertaining.

It was fun to watch.

I wanted to have some chicken, but sadly, I had to stick to my diet until the season ended.

Anyway.

I turned off my smartphone, leaving the two of them to fight.

They would probably end up singing my praises again, anyway.

I could tell without even looking.

But somehow, I felt a rebellious streak.

Arsenal and Parma?

What if I just transferred to a completely different team?

If I transferred to a team like Inter or Real Madrid, which showed strong interest in me, what expressions would they have?

I was oddly curious about that.

Oh, just saying.

I don't actually mean to transfer.

But I should still win a trophy this year.

Preferably... the league championship trophy.

Because I really like fairy tales.
