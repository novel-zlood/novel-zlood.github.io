## 18. Coppa Italia and an Unbeaten Season (2)

Parma is strong.

Even when facing other strong Serie A teams, they have the ability to win.

And many Parma fans are well aware that the driving force behind this performance is Park Minho.

At the same time, they harbored one anxiety.

What if Park Minho transfers?

Can Parma maintain its current level of performance?

If asked, they could confidently shake their heads.

"If we lose a striker who has recorded over 70 attacking points in a season, Parma is just another promoted team."

"Honestly, even promotion would have been difficult."

The reason Parma could become such a special team now is all thanks to Park Minho.

Knowing this, they enjoyed the current moment with Park Minho and hoped more than anyone else that Parma with Park Minho would win or achieve great records.

However, not everyone was optimistic about Parma's future.

There were those who worried about the time after Park Minho leaves.

They argued that Parma should start using their young youth resources to prepare for the future.

“There’s no word that the owner will invest a large amount of money, so I think we should start preparing by bringing up the youth now.”

“Right. Look at Kenese! As soon as he debuted in the first team, he scored 17 goals in 14 matches of the season and his potential exploded!”

“Minho won’t be at Parma forever. He might leave after this season.”

They cited the successful youth product, Kenese, as an example.

Of course, the majority opinion was that there was no need to bring out youth resources at such an important moment.

Parma, needing to win all the remaining matches, had no room to experiment with youth.

And with the money from selling Park Minho, they could acquire suitable resources to hold on.

However.

There was a situation where the fighting and harsh opinions exchanged within the Parma fandom would instantly transform into ‘We Are the One!’.

Yes, when Park Minho performed as he did now.

“Waaaah! That was great!”

“Minho is a god!”

“Kenese! Kenese!”

“Mi-nooooo!”

Parma’s home fans cheered louder for Park Minho than for the player who scored the goal.

Conversely, Atalanta’s away fans expressed their dissatisfaction.

“If we had Minho, this wouldn’t have happened.”

“Damn Parma bastards... boasting with the performance of just one player...!”

“When Minho leaves later, Parma will immediately fall into the relegation zone. I could bet this month’s salary on it.”

They also criticized Coach Alain Levagne.

They claimed he was a tactically inferior coach compared to others.

But that's incorrect.

If Coach Alain was tactically inferior, he could not have produced such results.

There are only 4 matches left for an undefeated season.

And the Coppa Italia final is just around the corner.

A tactically lacking coach could not achieve both of these feats.

Moreover, a close look at Parma’s records would show how dominant Alain’s 3-4-3 formation is in offensive statistics.

Therefore, Parma fans who knew a bit about football sneered and ignored the words of Atalanta fans.

“Foolish Atalanta bastards...”

“If it weren't for Alain’s offensive tactics, even promotion would have been difficult for Parma.”

“Right! They would have been struggling in the mid-table.”

Even those fans could not refute this one fact.

The fact that Park Minho is a one-man team.

But they didn’t bother to express displeasure.

“Waaaaah! So what if we are a one-man team? Minho is better than those damn 11 Atalanta players!”

“Minho! Minho! Minho!”

“Yes! We are a one-man team! Our team has Parma’s god! Park Minho!”

The first half ended 1-1.

The players left the field.

Parma fans kept chanting Park Minho’s name, making the Atalanta away fans even more uncomfortable.

This led to some scuffles.

About twenty Parma and Atalanta fans were taken out of the stands by the police.

Time passed like that.

The second half started as both teams returned to the field.

* * *

What kind of player am I?

A Korean who debuted in professional football at the slightly late age of 25, after my birthday at the end of April.

If I renew my contract with Parma, my value is certainly going to be at least 70 billion won.

A player who always delivers when needed in important matches like today.

Hmm... Plus, I never skip training.

If necessary, I even stay late for extra training.

I don’t particularly indulge in parties or clubs.

A player with no scandals outside of football.

Lastly, a striker for the team Parma.

And a player who can show various styles, like a chameleon.

Yes, that’s me.

Why am I saying this all of a sudden?

Well, because Coach Gasperini suddenly asked.

Asked what kind of player I think I am.

So I gave it some thought.

When I asked if I could answer after the game, Coach Gasperini nodded with a smile.

Why do coaches like Martinho and Gasperini have so many questions for me?

Do they like me that much?

Anyway.

The second half began.

Atalanta kept their style of play, maintaining strong pressure and one-on-one marking in the second half.

“Minho! Over here!”

Well, we also planned to attack differently in response to their play.

I passed to Santiago, who raised his hand.

It felt a bit awkward.

Parma was moving more freely than in the first half.

Santiago moved to the forefront.

I moved down to the central attacking midfield.

Gennaro moved to the wing and even dropped down to the midfield area to receive the ball.

Kenese dropped to the third line to receive the ball and then made long passes to the front line.

As the entire attacking line moved unexpectedly, one-on-one marking was not as effective.

As we started to move more away from our original positions, large spaces began to appear in Atalanta’s defense.

Thanks to this, we created many more opportunities than in the first half.

However, the instability in link-up play due to frequent changes in attacking positions led to an increase in turnovers.

Naturally, Parma’s increased turnovers gave Atalanta counter-attack opportunities.

As this situation continued, the game tempo sped up and the flow of the match became chaotic.

Seeing the ball being connected on the wing and glancing at the bench, I saw Coach Gasperini frowning.

He seemed displeased with us forcibly speeding up the game tempo.

“Gennaro! Over here!”

“Secure your position! Isn’t the turnover happening because you keep shifting?”

“Ah! Instead of talking, run!”

We talked more than in the first half.

It’s really chaotic.

As the game turned into a mud fight, spaces kept opening on the sides, leading to many crossing situations.

Relatively, our defense, which was strong in set-pieces, handled Atalanta’s attacks more easily.

-Although the game continues at a much rougher and faster tempo than the first half, the number of shots is significantly lower.

-Yes, as I’m saying this, the ball is connected to Minho.

“Minho!”

31 minutes into the second half.

It seems we’re finally benefiting from dragging them into a mud fight.

As I broke into the significantly empty space on the wing, the pass arrived in front of me at the perfect timing.

I still had some energy left.

Enough space to run forward.

I thought it would be neglecting my duty not to push the ball forward in this situation.

-Wow! Fast!

-Atalanta’s Joakim Mæhle tries to grab Minho’s jersey, but Minho breaks through and penetrates the wing!

Looks like my jersey stretched a bit.

Luckily it didn’t tear.

Bang!

I connected a long pass to the center and dashed towards the middle.

Kenese, positioned a bit outside the arc, received my pass and pushed through, fending off Halit Demiral and Berat Djimsiti’s joint defense with his body.

Despite the risk of losing the ball, Kenese pushed Halit Demiral down with his superior height.

He then made a perfect timing pass behind Atalanta’s last defender, Rafael.

At that exact timing, I turned my body, catching the offside line perfectly, and penetrated diagonally to receive Kenese’s pass.

-Perfect line breaking!

-Minho! It’s a chance!

A one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper created in an instant.

Seeing goalkeeper Juan Collazo rushing out, I kicked the ball hard at an angle he couldn’t reach.

Bang!

Thud!

The shot hit the goalpost at a sharp angle and shook the net.

-Gooooooal!

-Minho! A fantastic goal! Parma extends the lead to 2-1, widening the aggregate score to 4-2!

-Atalanta! Struggling to adapt to the sudden tempo change, eventually concedes a goal to Parma!

-Park Minho! Parma’s ace breaks Atalanta’s offside line and scores!

-I thought he preferred fast break-throughs, but who knew he was so good at line breaking!

-Perfect off-the-ball movement!

Whoosh!

I ran to the corner flag and slid down as if tackling.

Crash!

It seems I broke something.

That doesn’t matter.

I got up again and spread my arms.

“Waaaaah!”

“Minho! Minho! Park Minho!”

“Mi-nooooo!”

Home fans kept chanting my name as if it was the only word they knew.

This is strangely addictive.

I felt a desire to hear such cheers again in the Coppa Italia final.

But...

Only then did I see what I had broken.

Sliding down, I had smashed the corner flag with my foot... Do I have to pay for it?

* * *

Coach Gasperini burst into laughter as he watched Park Minho, who had broken the corner flag, receive a yellow card from the referee with a sheepish expression.

“They’re completely caught.”

Atalanta, quickly ensnared in the mud Parma had led them into, lost their color and crumbled.

There was no other option to change.

The football they had prepared was a swamp.

The tedious situation continued.

And when the full 45 minutes of the second half ended.

The referee quickly blew the whistle, signaling the end of the second leg of the Coppa Italia semifinals.

Coach Gasperini quietly closed his eyes.

-The first leg ended 2-1, and the second leg also ended 2-1, giving Parma a 4-2 aggregate score to advance to the Coppa Italia final!

-This is truly amazing! Parma!

-Already 8 goals in the Coppa Italia alone! Park Minho! He sends Parma to the Stadio Olimpico!

Parma’s home fans’ cheers filled the Ennio Tardini stadium.

They soon continued to chant Park Minho’s name, who had scored the most goals in this Coppa Italia.

Park Minho! Park Minho!

Park Minho! Park Minho!

Park Minho! Park Minho!

Parma Calcio stepped into the Coppa Italia final for the first time since 2002.

Naturally, this news spread through the media.

[Parma’s miracle! Defeating Atalanta with an aggregate score of 4-2, heading to Rome!]

[Park Minho’s great performance! 1 goal and 1 assist to bring down Atalanta!]

[With 45 goals and 31 assists this season, Park Minho is becoming a legend of Parma!]

[‘Park Minho!’ echoing through the Parma region, fans chant his name almost religiously!]

[Park Minho: ‘The season isn’t over yet. We’ll win all three remaining league matches and the Coppa Italia final!’]

-Park Minho... I really want him.

-I wish he would come to Atalanta.

-It was an entertaining match overall, but the possession and pass success rate were low... I prefer tighter football, maybe Alain Levagne isn’t for me.

-Doesn’t matter. Alain Levagne is a great coach just for discovering Minho.

-Is the final opponent AC Milan?

-Hah... those damn Rossoneri...

-Having taken down two Nerazzurri, it shouldn’t be hard to take down the Rossoneri too.

It wasn’t just Parma and Korean fans celebrating Parma’s advancement to the Coppa Italia final due to Park Minho’s performance.

-RealMilan: As expected... Our Minho! The beast striker who easily eats up fake Nerazzurri!

-KingJuventus: Why call him your Minho? Call him ‘Juventus’ Minho’.

-Roberto: Everyone shut up, you idiots.

-LoveMilan: ...

-KingJuventus: But why isn’t this guy saying anything? AC Milan also made it to the Coppa Italia final?

KingJuventus.

At chef Lee Sungkyung’s question, everyone in the group chat burst into laughter.

Except for one person.

-Roberto: LOL

-RealMilan: Ahahahahaha

-Monica: This is too funny :)

And then came an article.

Seeing it, Lee Sungkyung realized why.

LoveMilan.

AC Milan’s die-hard fan, Kim Joosik.

Why he looked so down.

[Park Minho: ‘My friend who is an AC Milan fan told me he would buy me a car if I scored a hat-trick against the Rossoneri. So I definitely want to score a hat-trick against AC Milan.’]

-LoveMilan: When did I ever say such a thing?

-LoveMilan: I don’t remember anything...

-LoveMilan: Minho must have heard wrong?

But no matter how strongly he denied it, the evidence remained.

In the voice recording made by other friends, his drunken voice could be heard saying exactly that.

-Roberto: Kim Joosik’s drunken promise

-Monica: Wow... Was this during the winter party?

-KingJuventus: When did you record this?

-RealMilan: LOL

While he kept denying and denying, Park Minho left a message after joining the chat.

Seeing it, Kim Joosik despaired greatly.

-Park Minho: Now it’s your turn!

-LoveMilan: Damn it! This must be a dream...!

Yes, it had to be a dream.

But even pinching his cheek didn’t wake him up from this dream.

Only his cheek hurt.

Kim Joosik muttered with a sad expression.

“I’m screwed!”
