## 4. Pro Debut (1)

"Waaaaah! Who's number 27?"

"Minho? Park Minho? Is he Korean?"

"Mi-no! Mi-no! Mi-no! Mi-no!"

The moment the score became 2-2.

The excited shouts of Parma's fans filled the field.

As expected, Italians are the most passionate people in Europe.

It's just a friendly match, but they're this excited.

What if I had scored in a derby?

Wouldn't it have been a blazing scene?

It sends a little chill down my spine.

Anyway.

"Minhooooooo!"

"Minho! Minho! Park Minho!"

"Waaaaah!"

But seriously, why are they calling my name all the way to the half-line?

"Minho! Just wave your hand once."

"But, Gianluca scored the goal."

"You made the goal happen."

As Gianluca urged me with a bright smile, I awkwardly waved my hand, and they liked it even more.

"Waaaaah! Minho waved at me!"

"Minho! Minho!"

I feel a strange sense of emotion.

What will it be like when I actually score a goal later?

I embraced this thrilling sensation in my chest and started to focus on the game again.

Soccer is really fun.

* * *

Soccer is a sport of mistakes.

If there were no mistakes in soccer, the score would always be just 0-0, and no one would come to the stadium to watch this boring sport.

A sport built on mistakes.

That's soccer, and the more you delve into it, the more you realize how unpredictable it is.

You press your opponent for 90 minutes.

You pound them and mess them up.

Yet, a single shot in the 90+1 minute can result in a comeback or an equalizer, costing you the victory.

That's the sport called soccer.

In that sense, until the 20th minute of the second half, Genoa was perfectly pressuring Parma and dominating the game.

But the score was 2-2.

Naturally, Genoa wouldn't be satisfied.

A team maintaining 60% possession.

A team with three times more shots on target.

Would such a team be satisfied with a 2-2 score?

I don't think so.

They must feel unfair.

They showed better performance, but the score is tied.

So, their line will push up.

Just like now.

"Push up! Push up!"

"Press harder!"

The Genoa coach, who is from England, mixes Italian and English as he encourages his players.

They knew they couldn't end without a win in three consecutive friendly matches.

No matter how friendly the match is.

If they can't secure a win with their current performance, it will undoubtedly affect the early part of the regular season.

So, they revealed their weaknesses, even if it meant taking risks.

To score a goal.

But.

Boom!

"Block it!"

Thanks to them pushing up the line, I, who was between the defense and midfield lines, could enjoy soccer even more.

This is already my third through pass in today's game.

Gianluca excitedly ran into the opponent's back space and received my pass.

Unlike me who was running slowly, Parma’s two wingers were quickly running toward the center.

Although Genoa's defender pushed Gianluca to the side, space was created in the half-space due to the wingers' central penetration.

I didn't miss this.

The coach also demanded this part.

I would pass to the back space.

The attacker and wingers would switch positions.

Finally, I would utilize the space created in the half-space to deliver a killer pass or finish the play myself.

As I sneaked into the empty space in the half-space, the pass came at the perfect timing.

Tuk!

I received the ball and took a shot as I slightly moved forward.

Boom! Daang!

The ball hit the goalpost and went over.

Gianluca gave me a thumbs-up.

"Minho! Good attempt!"

"I'll definitely score next time."

What a shame.

If I had shot a little lower, it would have gone in.

The turn went back to Genoa.

We'll be tormented for another 10 minutes or so.

It's true that Genoa's activity and performance are better than ours.

But soccer is a sport of flow, so even just 5 minutes can give us a chance to strike.

No matter how strong the team is, they can't press their opponent hard for the entire 90 minutes.

As I moved between the center and half-space, harassing the opponent's defenders, they couldn't easily push up the line like before.

Thanks to that, their build-up from the back was shaky.

I could see the flow being interrupted here and there.

I wouldn't miss such an opportunity.

Swish!

I passed again towards the empty space, and Gianluca ran like a hunting dog.

He really lacked only goal-scoring ability.

He was a player with many strengths as a forward.

In Parma, which has abundant second-line resources, Gianluca was an essential link-up forward.

As soon as he got the ball, he crossed it to the center.

The ball that rose to the center hit Santiago's head and shook the goalpost.

Daang!

Genoa's defenders checked where the ball would fall.

It was an empty space with no one.

But I was the first to move.

I, who had run quickly from the center, trusted my acceleration.

I believed I would be the first to reach the ball.

The flustered Genoa defenders.

Watching them, I curled the ball into a perfect angle.

Boom!

Thwack!

The shaking net.

Seeing the ball sucked into the goal, I quickly ran toward the direction of the crowd.

"Waaaaah! This is me! This is me!"

Swoosh!

In the second half.

Parma finally succeeded in turning the game around.

The score is now 3-2.

Genoa had to catch up with us again.

* * *

"Waaaaaaah! Goal! Goal! Goal! We scored against that damn Genoa! And three goals at that!"

"It's a comeback! A comeback!"

"When Franco got injured, I thought it was over... but we turned it around like this."

The fans who were watching the game with worried expressions clenched their fists in delight.

Their gaze was fixed on the 24-year-old late-blooming rookie.

Park Minho.

A player who joined Parma without a transfer fee.

No one expected a player with no professional experience to perform like this in a friendly match.

When they saw Franco, the heart of the team, get injured, they thought this season was over too.

But seeing a player like this emerge, it seemed the soccer gods hadn't abandoned Parma.

With this one goal, the flow of the game shifted.

Parma gained composure.

Genoa, who allowed the comeback, became desperate.

"Good! Let's hold on like this!"

"The opponent is getting very impatient! Just a little longer!"

Genoa was desperate.

If they lost today's game, it would be their third consecutive loss in friendly matches.

In a situation where they desperately needed a win, this loss would be a painful blow.

This loss could potentially linger as an aftereffect throughout the season, continuously tormenting them.

So, Genoa came out as offensively as possible.

Thwack!

The problem was, the more aggressive they came out, the more their impatience led to worse results.

"Waaaaah!"

"Gianluca! Gianluca! Gianluca!"

Gianluca, who neatly handled the cross from the flank, clenched his fist and savored the goal.

The score was now 4-2, making it a score that Genoa couldn't easily catch up to.

Park Minho, who was the starting point of this goal.

1 assist, 1 goal.

He, who showcased a perfect performance, smiled brightly and high-fived Gianluca.

* * *

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The referee blew the whistle to signal the end of the game.

At the same time, Parma's players smiled brightly and enjoyed the victory in the friendly match.

On the other hand, Genoa's players didn't look happy.

A shocking three-game losing streak.

Especially since the last loss was to Parma, a team in Serie B, it would sting even more.

Naturally, the result of today's game was featured in Parma's local newspaper.

[Parma Calcio! A 4-2 victory over Genoa in a friendly match!]

[Crying over Franco's injury, laughing at the performance of a 24-year-old rookie with a special story!]

[1 goal, 1 assist! Park Minho, who revitalized the team's attack after coming on in the second half!]

["Park Minho!" The name that echoed in the stadium! Who is this player who captivated Parma's fans?]

[Minho: "It was a good performance. In the second half, we were able to play the soccer we wanted."]

[Coach Alain Lavin: "Franco's injury isn't too serious. But it's true he won't be available for the early part of the season. We have to play without Franco until the third round of Serie B."]

[Comments]

- It was a perfect game! Although Franco's injury is really unfortunate, I think it was a satisfying game in that we found a player who can replace him.

- Isn't he that guy? The one who got frustrated and played himself after winning a tour event?

- I heard he played soccer professionally in Korea until he was 19.

- Can this guy who joined without a transfer fee really fill Franco's shoes? Of course, today's game was amazing, but it's still worrying.

- Can this Korean survive in Serie B?

- I hope he does well.

- Judging by today's game alone, it was perfect. I am confident he will show decent results in the regular season too.

- Minho! He's a god!

The local reaction in Parma wasn't bad.

Some fans pointed out my lack of experience as a concern and said they needed to watch more.

But overall, the response was satisfying.

Well, I joined the team without a transfer fee.

It must feel like finding money on the street for free.

But this wasn't the end.

[Debuting at 24? Why did a Korean amateur debut in Serie B?]

[An interesting story! Who is Park Minho, and how did he join Serie B's Parma?]

I received messages saying that some journalists in Korea also posted news about me.

My father was happy that I was adjusting well, and my mother said she might end up on TV later, so she went to a dermatologist yesterday.

"......."

This wasn't the end.

Roberto and my Italian friends.

And the Korean student friends on the WhatsApp group chat were filled with my stories.

- MilanLove: Minho! Minho! You have to move to AC Milan and lift the championship trophy! You have to!

- RealMilan: Come to Inter. There's no need to go to that fake Milan.

- MilanLove: Yeah, the fake Milan is you guys, right?

- KingJuve: But don't both teams have no money right now?

- RealMilan: Yeah, NoShowtus, get lost.

- MilanLove: Ugh! You punk! Why are you, a team with no roots, interfering when the two great Milan teams are talking?

- KingJuve: ㅠㅠㅠㅠ

- Roberto: It was a truly amazing game! I told you, Minho is good at soccer!

Three Korean students.

Two Italian friends.

And me, making a total of six people in this chat group, which Roberto, who is interested in Korean culture, created a year ago.

- Monica: Congratulations, Minho.

- Park Minho: Thank you.

- KingJuve: Minho! You're coming to Juventus, right?

- Park Minho: Last time Juventus made an offer, but their salary was lower than Parma's, so I didn't go.

- RealMilan: Hahahahahaha, poor club hahaha

- MilanLove: Hahahaha, really poor bastards hahaha

- KingJuve: ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

Despite being rival teams with a derby, AC Milan and Inter's relationship was better than their relationship with Juventus.

Thanks to that, the friend who liked Juventus was teased every day by the two Milan supporters.

Anyway.

I received congratulations from everyone.

They asked if I was going to debut at this rate.

And time passed quickly.

Although I wasn't a starter in friendly matches, I frequently played and slowly built up my stats.

Thanks to that?

On August 15th.

Copa Italia Round 1.

The opponent was Ternana from Serie B.

I was confirmed to start in this match.

"Finally......."

Yes.

I'm finally making my professional debut.

Sooner than I expected.
