## 4. Pro Debut (1)

"Uwaaaaah! Who's number 27?"

"Minho? Park Minho? Is he Korean?"

"Mi-no! Mi-no! Mi-no! Mi-no!"

The moment it became a 2-2 tie.

The excited shouts of Parma fans filled the field.

As expected, Italians are the most passionate people in Europe.

Even for a friendly match, they are this enthusiastic.

What if I scored a goal in a derby?

Wouldn't there be flares going off?

I felt a slight chill in my chest.

Anyway.

"Minooooooo!"

"Mino! Mino! Park Minho!"

"Uwaaaaaah!"

But why do they keep calling my name all the way to the halfway line?

"Mino! Just wave once."

"But Gianluca scored the goal."

"You created the goal."

When I awkwardly waved in response to Gianluca's bright smile, they liked it even more.

"Uwaaaah! Mino waved at me!"

"Mino! Mino!"

I felt a strange sense of emotion.

What will it be like when I score a goal later?

With this thrilling feeling in my chest, I started to focus on the match again.

Football is really fun.

* * *

Football is a sport of mistakes.

If there were no mistakes in football, the score would always remain 0-0, and no one would come to the stadium to watch this boring sport.

A sport built on mistakes.

That's football, and the deeper you dig into it, the more mysterious it becomes.

You can press the opponent for 90 minutes straight.

Overwhelm and wreck them.

But in the 90+1 minute, one shot can lead to a comeback or an equalizer, ruining the victory.

That's the nature of football.

In that sense, until the 20th minute of the second half, Genoa was completely dominating Parma by pressing them perfectly.

But the result was 2-2.

Of course, Genoa would be dissatisfied.

They had maintained 60% possession.

They also had three times as many shots on target.

Would such a team be satisfied with a 2-2 score?

I don't think so.

They would feel unfairly treated.

They showed better performance.

But the score was tied.

So, they would push their line up.

Just like now.

"Push up! Push up!"

"Press harder!"

The Genoa coach, from England, mixed Italian and English to encourage his players.

They knew very well that they couldn't end a friendly match without a win for three consecutive games.

No matter how friendly the match was.

If they couldn't secure a win with this kind of performance, it would definitely affect the early regular season.

So, they revealed their weaknesses a bit, even if it was risky, to score a goal.

But.

Booom!

"Block it!"

Thanks to them pushing the line up, I had more fun playing football in the space between the defense and midfield.

This was already my third through pass of the game.

Gianluca excitedly penetrated the opponent's backline to receive my ball.

Unlike me, who was running slowly, Parma's two wingers were quickly moving towards the center.

The Genoa defender pushed Gianluca to the side, but at the same time, the two wingers who were cutting in towards the center created space in the half-space.

I didn't miss it.

The coach also demanded this part.

I would pass to the back space.

The forwards and wingers would switch positions.

Finally, I would either make the perfect killer pass or finish using the created half-space.

When I sneaked into the empty half-space, the pass came in at the perfect timing.

Tap!

I controlled the ball and moved slightly inside before taking a shot.

Boom! Thud!

The ball hit the goalpost and went over.

Gianluca gave me a thumbs-up.

"Mino! That was a good attempt!"

"I'll definitely score next time."

It's a pity.

If I had shot a bit lower, it would have gone in.

The turn went back to Genoa.

We would struggle for about 10 more minutes.

The fact was that Genoa had better activity and performance than us.

But football is a sport of flow, so even 5 minutes could give us a chance to press.

No matter how strong the team is, they can't press the opponent hard for the entire 90 minutes.

As I harassed the opposing defenders by moving between the center and half-space, they couldn't push their line up easily like before.

Thanks to that, their build-up from the back was shaken.

I noticed their rhythm breaking here and there.

I wouldn't miss this opportunity.

Whoosh!

When I passed to the open space again, Gianluca ran like a hunting dog.

He only lacked finishing ability.

As a forward, he had many strengths.

In Parma, which had abundant second-line resources, Gianluca was an indispensable linking forward.

As soon as he got the ball, he quickly crossed it to the center.

The floating ball hit Santiago's head, who was cutting into the center, and shook the goalpost.

Thud!

The Genoa defenders checked where the ball was falling.

It was an empty space where no one was.

But I was the first to move.

I trusted my acceleration as I ran quickly from the center.

I believed I would be the first to reach the ball.

The confused Genoa defenders.

While looking at them, I curled the ball at the perfect angle.

Boom!

Thwack!

The shaking net.

Seeing the ball sucked into the goal, I quickly ran towards the direction of the crowd.

"Uwaaaaaah! This is me! This is who I am!"

Whoosh!

In the second half.

Parma finally succeeded in turning the game around.

The score was now 3-2.

Genoa had to chase us again.

* * *

"Waah! Goal! Goal! Goal! We scored against those damn Genoa! And three goals at that!"

"It's a comeback! A comeback!"

"When Franco got injured, I thought it was over... But we turned it around like this."

The fans, who had been watching the game with worried expressions, clenched their fists in joy.

Their eyes were on the 24-year-old late-blooming rookie.

Park Minho.

A player who joined Parma without any transfer fee.

No one expected a player with no professional experience to perform like this in a friendly match.

When they saw Franco, the heart of the team, get injured, they thought the season was over.

But seeing a player like him emerge, it seemed the football gods hadn't abandoned Parma.

With that one goal, the flow of the game changed.

Parma had some breathing room.

Genoa, which allowed the comeback, became desperate.

"Alright! Let's hold on like this!"

"The opposition has become quite desperate! Just hold on a bit longer!"

Genoa was in a hurry.

Losing today would mean three consecutive defeats in friendly matches.

In a situation where they desperately needed a win, this loss was painful.

It could haunt them throughout the season.

So, Genoa came out as offensively as possible.

Thwack!

The problem was that the urgency the players felt from being on the offensive led to worse results.

"Uwaaaaaah!"

"Gianluca! Gianluca! Gianluca!"

Gianluca, who neatly handled the cross that came from the side, clenched his fist and savored the goal.

The score was now 4-2, making it hard for Genoa to catch up.

Park Minho, who was the starting point of the goal.

1 assist, 1 goal.

He showcased perfect performance, smiling brightly as he high-fived with Gianluca.

* * *

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The referee blew the whistle to signal the end of the match.

At the same time, Parma's players smiled brightly and celebrated their friendly match victory.

On the other hand, Genoa's players didn't look pleased.

A shocking three-game losing streak.

Moreover, the last defeat was to Parma, a Serie B team, which must have stung even more.

Naturally, after the match, the result was reported in the local Parma newspaper.

[Parma Calcio! 4-2 victory against Genoa in a friendly match!]

[Parma, crying over Franco's injury and laughing at the performance of a 24-year-old rookie with a special story!]

[1 goal, 1 assist! Park Min-ho, who energized the team's attack after coming on in the second half!]

["Park Min-ho!" The name echoed through the stadium! Who is this player who captured the hearts of Parma's fans?]

[Min-ho, "It was a good performance. We were able to play the kind of football we wanted in the second half."]

[Coach Alain Levagne, "Franco's injury is not severe. But it's true that he won't be available for the early part of the season. We have to play up to the 3rd round of Serie B without Franco."]

[Comments]

- It was a perfect match! Franco's injury is really unfortunate, but I think it was a satisfying game considering we found a player who can replace him.

- Is it that guy? The one who got frustrated during a tour event and ended up playing himself?

- I heard he trained professionally in Korea until he was 19.

- Can a player we got for free fill Franco's shoes? Of course, today's game was fantastic, but it's still a concern.

- Can this Korean survive in Serie B?

- I hope he does well.

- Based on today's game alone, he was perfect. I'm confident he'll show decent performance in the regular season too.

- Min-ho! He's a god!

The response in Parma wasn't bad.

Some fans pointed out my lack of experience and said they needed to see more.

But overall, the reaction was satisfactory.

Well, I joined the team without a transfer fee.

It must feel like finding money on the street for free.

But this isn't the end.

[Pro debut at 24? Why a Korean amateur made his pro debut in Serie B.]

[A fun episode! Who is Park Minho, and how did he join Parma in Serie B?]

Some reporters in Korea also contacted me, saying they posted news about me.

My father was happy, saying I was adjusting well, and my mother said she might appear on TV someday and went to a dermatologist yesterday for skin care.

"……."

This wasn't the end.

Roberto and my Italian friends.

And my Korean student friends filled the group chat on WhatsApp with my stories.

- MilanLover: Minho! Minho! You must transfer to AC Milan and lift the championship cup! Promise?

- RealMilan: Come to Inter. No need to go to that fake Milan.

- MilanLover: Yeah, fake Milan is you guys, right?

- KingJuventus: But don't both teams have no money right now?

- RealMilan: Yeah, NoShowtus, get lost.

- MilanLover: Hey! You! How dare a team with no roots interrupt the conversation between the two great Milan teams!

- KingJuventus: ㅠㅠㅠㅠ

- Roberto: It was a fantastic game! I told you, Mino is good at football!

Three Korean students.

Two Italian friends.

And me, making a total of six, were in this group created by Roberto, who was interested in Korean culture, a year ago.

- Monica: Congrats, Mino.

- Park Minho: Thanks.

- KingJuventus: Minho! You're coming to Juventus, right?

- Park Minho: Juventus offered me a transfer last time, but the salary was lower than Parma's, so I didn't go.

- RealMilan: Hahaha, the beggar club, hahaha.

- MilanLover: Hahaha, really a beggar, hahaha.

- KingJuventus: ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

Even though AC Milan and Inter were rival teams with a derby, their relationship with Juventus was worse.

Thanks to that, the friend who liked Juventus was teased by the two Milan fans every day.

Anyway.

I received congratulations from everyone.

They asked if I would debut just like this.

And time passed quickly.

Even though I wasn't a starter, I often played in friendly matches and slowly built up my stats.

Was it because of that?

August 15th.

The first round of the Coppa Italia.

The opponent was Ternana, a Serie B team.

I was confirmed as a starter for this match.

"Finally..."

Yes.

I was finally making my pro debut.

And sooner than I thought.
