## 11. Step Up? Level Up! (2)

The break period has arrived.

In the last match of December, I was able to play as a substitute for about 10 minutes.

The team continued its winning streak with a 3-0 victory, even though I didn't make any significant contributions.

Starting from mid-December.

A month-long break that continues until mid-January.

Santiago planned to go to Argentina and rest for about a week.

Lautaro Valencia was heading to Spain.

Others also chose their respective vacation spots to replenish the physical and mental energy expended during the first half of the season.

"Look here, as you can see... there's a lot of fatigue accumulated in your left knee and ankle."

"Will it affect the second half of the season?"

"That, I can't say for sure. I am certain that this accumulated fatigue will impact you at some point... but no one knows when."

"Hmm..."

"Still, your muscle strength and stamina have improved a lot. This is the state of Minho's muscles recorded during the medical test before you first joined... and this is your current data."

Wow... I've really changed a lot.

The changed data was evident at a glance.

This is the result of my efforts.

I'm somewhat satisfied.

But not all the news was good.

"You need to change your playing style."

"My playing style?"

"Yes, dribbling long and making sharp direction changes to beat opponents will have a negative impact on your knees. You need to reduce these kinds of moves."

Changing my playing style.

That's a bit disappointing.

For me, dribbling to beat opponents has been the most efficient way of attacking until now.

And my main weapon was breaking down opponents with sharp direction changes.

"Minho, you don't need to overthink this. I'm not telling you to stop dribbling altogether. Just reduce the frequency."

"How about the rest?"

"Except for the accumulated fatigue in your left knee and ankle, everything else is in normal condition. If you can't give up dribbling... one way is to change the pivot foot when making direction changes during dribbling."

"Have I been using my left foot as the pivot all along?"

"Yes, it's a habit of yours. Every soccer player has their own habits."

A habit, huh.

I didn't realize I had one.

This is quite interesting.

"Ah! Let's exclude Ronaldinho. That guy could do every trick in the world, a player who truly couldn't be stopped because no one knew what he would do next."

"He had no set patterns or habits. I had the chance to watch him play directly when I was a rookie on the medical team at Barcelona... it was truly mesmerizing."

I'm jealous.

That means he watched Ronaldinho's game directly.

Seeing my expression, the team doctor smiled widely.

He knew too.

That he was lucky to see such play in person.

"Since we have about a month of break... it would be good to rest completely for about a week and then spend the remaining time getting used to using your right foot as the pivot."

"Will that allow me to play longer?"

The doctor smiled at my question.

"I don't know that either. But... it has the advantage of possibly delaying your visit to the operating room."

That's enough for me.

The first mission of the break period.

- Break the habit of using only the left foot as the pivot when making upper body feints and direction changes.

"Good."

Having confirmed the first mission.

Now, let's look at the second mission.

* * *

Monica watched the juggling dribble that Park Minho showed in the last match several times.

It was truly a mesmerizing level of skill.

She thought it was a fantastic play reminiscent of Thierry Henry, the legend of Arsenal.

Just like how Parma went into a break.

Monica also recently went on a break.

She spent her rare free time lounging in her room or reading books.

Or she read articles about Park Minho, and if there were hateful comments, she would become an internet warrior and fight back...

She was busier than she thought.

Unlike other Italian women, she was quite introverted and cautious about love. She lay on her bed like a dried fish, staring at the group chat on her smartphone.

- LoveMilano: So, where are we meeting? Milan? Or Parma?

Her Korean friend Kim Joosik, who works in the fashion industry.

An AC Milan fan and the boyfriend of 'TrueMilan' Cha Hyerin, an Inter Milan fan.

He often meets Monica through work.

His words began to make the group chat lively.

- TrueMilan: Wouldn't Parma be better? Monica, Roberto, and Minho are all in Parma... it would be better for us to go there, right?

Cha Hyerin, who works as a perfumer for a startup fragrance company, made a suggestion that Monica pondered deeply.

Meeting in Parma?

It didn't seem like a bad idea.

- KingJjangYuve: What do you want to eat? Vote quickly. I'll cook according to the majority.

KingJjangYuve.

Lee Seongkyung is a Juventus fan and a golden spoon who came to Italy to learn cooking.

Monica had been surprised more than once by the luxury brands he often wore.

It was like he was wearing a sports car on his body.

- Roberto: Hey! Let's just meet at my place!

Roberto is a die-hard fan of Parma.

He works in construction.

Monica often shares opinions with Roberto when discussing the national football team.

- Park Minho: Ah! Monica! There's something I want to ask.

Lastly, Park Minho.

As you know, he was a regular person learning landscaping.

Now, he's the rising star and ace of Parma.

The man she has a crush on.

- Monica: What is it?

- Park Minho: Is there a gift you want to receive?

Monica suddenly jolted upright.

And she stared blankly at her smartphone screen.

"This... this is a signal, right? It is, right?"

She was so happy her hands were shaking.

Suddenly, Park Minho talking about a gift?

She couldn't believe it.

- TrueMilan: Oh no! A call from the office... let's talk about the party tomorrow!

- LoveMilano: I'm busy too... let's touch base tomorrow.

- KingJjangYuve: All of a sudden?

- KingJjangYuve: Let's just decide today...

- TrueMilan: Read the room, you piece of shit.

- LoveMilano: Juventus, who are 6th in the league, should keep quiet and follow the words of the Milan brothers, who are 1st and 2nd in Serie A. Okay?

- KingJjangYuve: Okay...

The group chat suddenly quieted down.

Then, a separate message came from Roberto.

- Roberto: Just go for it. Ask for a ring. Got it?

- Monica: Wouldn't that be a bit burdensome?

- Roberto: You have to be obvious for Minho to notice you. If you don't, you'll just keep running parallel forever.

- Roberto: Look out for Minho! He's really clueless in this area! He's dense and thick-headed!

Listening to his advice, Monica nodded.

Yes, I should boldly ask for it.

And at this party, I'll either get a proper confession or, if it's too difficult, I'll confess myself.

With that in mind, she moved her fingers.

- Monica: A ring.

A moment of silence followed.

Three minutes passed.

And then a message from Park Minho arrived.

- Park Minho: A ring? Got it!

"Yes!"

The Italian dried fish lady Monica clenched her fist in joy and rolled around on the bed.

In her head, the scene of Park Minho kneeling and offering a ring while confessing was playing on repeat without stopping.

* * *

A ring all of a sudden.

For a moment, I found myself imagining marrying Monica, having kids, and even seeing grandchildren, which made my reply late.

I wondered if my late reply might have annoyed her.

I was a bit worried.

Anyway.

Preparations for the party with friends are going well.

And I'm gradually getting used to the first mission.

Things are going smoothly.

But I can't be satisfied yet.

There's still the second mission left.

"How should I mess with Coach Martinho?"

At my question, the slacker Santiago, who came back from Argentina after a week and gained 3 kg, answered.

"I don't know."

Why so uncooperative?

Should I make him run another lap?

Seeing my gaze, Santiago hung his head low.

Who told him to gain 3 kg?

After finishing light physical training.

I headed to the analysis room.

AS Roma.

A strong team in Serie A.

Currently ranked 3rd in the league.

To face this team, what kind of moves should I make?

"It's not easy."

Looking at the data on AS Roma gathered in the analysis room, I couldn't help but be impressed.

Is this what a strong team in the top 4 leagues looks like?

Their movements and team organization were on a different level.

"And they say this is outdated tactics?"

A tactic emphasizing conservative defense.

And scoring through quick counterattacks.

It's definitely an excellent tactic.

But a tough team for us to face.

Yet, it's not without weaknesses.

If Coach Martinho's tactics were still effective, he would be leading the league.

Unfortunately, his tactics are less effective against modern, systematic high-press strategies.

"And they consume even more energy than us."

The fatal flaw in Coach Martinho's tactics at AS Roma is the exceptionally high energy consumption.

His 'deep-line defense and counterattack tactic' involves dropping the line extremely low, winning the ball, and launching quick counterattacks from deep positions to high positions.

Then, when they lose the ball, they're back to deep positions.

This means players have to constantly shuttle back and forth across the pitch.

This means their energy consumption is higher than other teams.

This was similar at Tottenham.

It's amazing that senior Shin Junseo didn't have any physical breakdowns despite the enormous activity under Coach Martinho.

I roughly understood what tactics the opponent would use.

Next, I focused on the player I'd directly face.

I turned my attention to the opponent's left flank.

"Castos Vina."

A good player.

Especially with fast speed and decent acceleration, breaking through with dribbles or delivering sharp crosses, he recorded quite a few offensive points this season.

If I play on the right flank.

I'd have to frequently move to help the flank defense against Castos Vina's movements, and it seemed like it would be quite challenging.

He's that fast and explosive.

But he's not without flaws.

"There are more holes than I expected."

The downside of an offensive fullback.

They always expose space behind them.

And their defense is shaky.

"Plus, he's weak in aerial duels."

He's about 180 cm, similar to my height.

But his jumping ability and handling of aerial balls are weak, often conceding the left side to physically superior wingers.

This is definitely worth targeting.

Since it's hard to showcase dribbling breakthroughs for a while, I need to adopt a different playing style.

I suddenly had a good idea.

Mario Mandzukic.

What if I utilize the way he played when deployed at Juventus?

Although similar in physique to the opponent.

I was confident I could jump higher and protect the ball better.

"Playing like a target man on the flank."

Doesn't seem bad.

Matteo, the assistant coach, also nodded positively after hearing my opinion.

"Moving like you did when you played as a striker for the national team could work."

"Playing as a post player on the flank, connecting the ball to the center."

"Surely, the opponent would be flustered."

Matteo's eyes sparkled.

Imagining the opposing fullback's flustered reaction, I also thought it wasn't a bad move.

"Then... should I practice post play?"

Post play, borrowed from basketball terminology.

Precisely, hold-up play.

A player who's exceptionally good at this hold-up play.

Who should I learn from?

Giroud? Benzema? Lukaku?

So I asked.

To the sea of information, the internet.

Not long after posting a question in a football community, I got an interesting answer.

- 'For "holding up and shielding," isn't the "football physicist" John Obi Mikel the best?'

John Obi Mikel?

His name already sounded unusual.

- His real name is Mikel John Obi.

- That's bullshit! His real name is Obi John Mikel.

- No, no, his real name is John Obi Michael.

- Actually, his real name is John Einstein Mikel.

Ignoring the various strange comments.

I looked up John Obi Mikel.

To see what kind of player he was.

But something felt off.

"This player is a defensive midfielder?"

I'm a second-line midfielder.

And what kind of sense is this to shield the ball?

He's slow and doesn't even dribble.

It looks precarious to watch.

But strangely stable in the long run.

A level beyond a master.

Truly a football physicist.

"But can I imitate this?"
