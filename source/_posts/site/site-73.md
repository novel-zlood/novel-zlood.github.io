## 26. The Beginning of a Fairy Tale (2)

The day has dawned.

This means the match against Lazio is imminent.

Filippo Asnerelli, a simple Italian thug who raises hamsters, has recently become deeply religious.

Oh, it seemed he had fallen for Buddhism introduced by Perelle.

It wasn't bad.

As long as one doesn't fall into some strange cult, it's true that religion can positively impact a football player's mentality.

From my experience in the military,

I realized that having something to rely on mentally isn't a bad idea. Hence, during my military service, I believed in four religions: Christianity, Buddhism, Catholicism, and Won Buddhism.

That's how much religion influences the mind.

It's not because I wanted to eat hamburgers, tteokbokki, toast, or pizza.

Anyway.

Perelle, who found stability through religion, was playing really hard in the midfield line.

His stability was exceptional, and he covered the shortcomings of Joshua, who had newly joined the team.

The reason why Marjan, who always grumbles at Joshua, tries to teach Perelle various things is that Perelle is really dedicated to training.

That's how great religion can be.

The problem arises when one believes in a cult.

"Parc Minhooo!"

"Ooooo! Minho! Minho! Minho!"

"Our Minho will score a hat-trick against Lazio today. Do you believe it?"

"We believe! We believe!"

I was seriously worried that many young players had been captivated by a strange cult created by Joshua and Kenneth.

Kenneth usually returns to normal after a few days, so I let him be, but with Joshua joining in, it felt like even Kenneth had broken down.

Well, letting things be is probably the best.

I believe they'll come around on their own.

I believe so.

"Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!"

Seriously... They'll come around, right?

* * *

January 25th.

Roberto, who visited Ennio Tardini after a long time, smiled as he felt the familiar scent of the field.

Wearing an autographed uniform he got from his friend, Park Minho, he perfectly looked the part of a die-hard Parma fan.

Already, other Parma fans started gathering around him.

"Hey! Roberto!"

"Ah! Mr. Vittorio."

Roberto, who exchanged a light hug with Vittorio, who runs a nearby butcher shop, spoke while looking at the field.

"Feeling good today, right?"

"Yeah, who would've thought those Lazio guys would bark like that in interviews?"

"Idiots. They think they can stop Minho. There's a Korean proverb I learned from Minho, 'A barking dog never bites.'"

"It means the Lazio guys are cowardly and can't even bite! As expected, Parma's god is different!"

"Ha ha ha! He'll probably score a hat-trick today too, right?"

"Of course!"

The pleasant conversation continued, and longtime die-hard Parma fans began to gather in one place.

Their eyes were filled with confidence.

From last season to this year,

The performance Park Minho has shown has been so extraordinary that calling him a "god" isn't an exaggeration.

"Oh! Minho is coming in!"

"Minooooo! Kennethhhh!"

"Parc Minho! Parc Minho!"

Almost 80% of the cheers were directed toward Park Minho, but unlike typical players who might feel a bit disappointed, the Parma players were different.

They couldn't feel jealousy or any negative emotions because they had seen Park Minho's abilities firsthand within Parma.

It was possible because all the young players were united around Park Minho.

Even Lazio's players, seemingly intrigued by the overwhelming support for one player, glanced at Park Minho and had brief conversations.

Soon, Parma's anthem started playing.

Roberto sang the anthem with all his might, praying for Parma's victory in today's match.

Piii!

As soon as the referee blew the whistle, the players of both teams started moving.

At the same time, Roberto warmed his cold body with lime tea he bought from a caf√© inside the stadium.

"Roberto. Look at those Lazio guys."

"They seem well-prepared today."

Roberto, who was chatting with Vittorio, quickly turned his head as soon as Park Minho got the ball.

Everyone, even those who were briefly resting, hurriedly got up to watch the scene.

Even though Park Minho just lightly moved forward with the ball, all eyes were on him.

Park Minho, who was slowly dribbling the ball, effortlessly bypassed Lazio's Elseid Hysaj and crossed the ball.

At the end of the cross was Kenneth.

Kenneth leapt up and headed the ball.

Despite gradually increasing his muscle mass recently, his jumping ability showed no signs of diminishing.

Displaying the limits of human physicality.

Lazio's goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha, barely managed to save Kenneth's header.

Oooooh!

Home fans expressed their disappointment with a loud groan.

Parma, who secured the second ball, started pressing Lazio continuously.

Coach Sarri urgently scolded Lazio's backline, trying to reorganize the defense, but Joshua, who secured the second ball, connected it to Park Minho with an exquisite pass.

A perfect opportunity.

Park Minho was not a player to miss such a great chance.

A perfectly clean touch.

As soon as he passed it to Kenneth, Kenneth scored with a perfect shot.

Wham!

As the goal went in, Ennio Tardini resonated with the cheers of Parma's home fans.

The cheers were so loud that it didn't seem like it was from just around 20,000 fans.

"Wooahhhh!"

"Minooooooo!"

"Kennethhhhh!"

"Parc Minho! Parc Minho!"

Roberto also jumped and rejoiced.

Vittorio, a fellow die-hard fan, took off his top and shook his belly fat while shaking his hips.

His hips had "Stupid Lazio" written on them.

* * *

Football is a sport.

And it's a form of entertainment.

A pastime that both players and spectators can enjoy.

That's the charm of football.

"Bastard!"

"You! Did you see his face! Huh!"

"Jerk! Wait! Just wait!"

The Lazio fans in the away section seemed very angry at a nearby Parma fan's hip dance.

Surely, seeing something like that when you're losing would make you really angry.

But that guy's hips sure are firm.

The problem is, the guy shaking his hips next to that firm-hipped man looks like my friend.

Why is Roberto shaking his hips there?

I'm a bit confused.

I thought it might be someone who looked like him.

But passing by and glancing, it was indeed Roberto.

Anyway.

I don't know what Lazio thought after seeing that, but they started attacking quite aggressively, unlike before.

Coach Riccardo Sarri seemed to think they couldn't lose like this, hence the aggressive approach.

Thanks to that, Kenneth was having a field day.

He was shaking Lazio's defense with his lively movements.

- Kenneth! He's fast! How can he be so fast with that build?

- Another shoooot! Ah! The shot misses!

- Joshua is holding his head in frustration after the missed pass.

Kenneth and Joshua's coordination was particularly good.

Though they seemed not to get along well, they matched perfectly on the field.

Nonetheless, Lazio was still Lazio.

They eventually scored an equalizer.

- Goooal!

- Fabio Immobile! The player who lost the top scorer position in the league has scored and is now tied with Minho in goals!

- Fabio Immobile, with his 21st league goal, brings the game back to a tie for Lazio.

Indeed, a tough opponent.

But our Kenneth scored again.

Kenneth's form has been terrifying lately.

It felt like watching Zlatan during his time at Inter.

Though their styles are completely different, honestly, Kenneth lacked nothing in terms of goal-scoring ability.

Wooooaaaahhh!

Kenneth, who perfectly headed the cross from Santiago, clenched his fist and shouted.

"Wooaaaaaah!"

He usually doesn't show such emotions, but today, the usually stoic figure seemed to express his feelings well.

The score became 2-1 again.

With Lazio trailing.

But Lazio's pursuit was fierce.

They eventually equalized again.

This time, it was an amazing scissors kick by their second-line player, Felipe Pereira.

It was such an incredible shot that even the opposing fans were amazed.

Even Parma's home fans looked at Felipe in surprise.

- The match is very tense.

- Both teams' attacking power is impressive. Parma slightly leads in possession with 53%.

- But in terms of shots, Lazio has a slight edge.

The match was indeed intense.

Whenever I got the ball, two players marked me, making it hard to break through.

Of course, the more they marked me, the freer Kenneth and other attackers became.

The previous two goals were also scored because I sacrificed myself.

So I had no major complaints.

I wasn't anxious about not scoring.

Wasn't I showing the famous "Invisible Something" that came up in a community?

Even so, it's true that I haven't scored in this match yet.

Some of my haters are probably talking bad about me.

I planned to watch quietly until the middle of the second half.

It's true that Lazio's defense was shaking, investing two players to mark me.

- Goooal!

- Lazio! They finally take the lead just before halftime!

- Carlos Barkley's long-range shot goes in cleanly!

- The score is now 3-2 with Lazio in the lead!

But it's a different story when we get overtaken like this.

[Where has Parma's god gone?]

Moreover, seeing a Lazio fan holding such a sign in the away section, how could I stay still?

Thinking of showing those guys who Parma's god is, I quickly headed to the locker room after the first half ended.

See you in the second half,

Lazio friends.

* * *

Sumet Vrsaljko and Felipe Pereira, who were marking Park Minho on the right side in today's match, gained great confidence after the first half.

"Parma's god? Not bad."

"Indeed... No matter how good a player is, if two players mark him, he can't perform his best."

Of course, because of that, their giant attacker Kenneth broke through and scored two goals, but on the other hand, they scored three goals and ended the first half in a good mood.

Coach Riccardo Sarri was pleased that his tactical pattern worked perfectly.

If there were no major issues in the second half, the hopeful atmosphere continued that Lazio would win.

But goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha thought differently.

He was worried that Parma might bring a completely different approach in the second half.

'A team that continues an unbeaten streak in the league. Such a team wouldn't just sit back and take it.'

He shared his opinion with Coach Sarri, but his boss merely pretended to listen.

"Good opinion, Thomas. I'll consider changing the tactics in the second half."

"Understood, boss."

But contrary to his words, there was no change.

Even as the second half started, Lazio remained the same.

Appropriate forward pressing and attacking development using full-backs.

Two markers sticking to Park Minho on the flank.

But Parma was different.

First, Santiago was substituted for Gennaro Tatis, who took his place behind Park Minho, which was a problem.

In a game where his condition wasn't great, Santiago, who had a tendency to hog the ball, was replaced with Gennaro, an attacker known for his linking play, as a winger.

This alone allowed Park Minho more freedom from pressure when breaking through from the flank to the center.

Just this one change made Park Minho, who had been walking around with two players in the first half, completely different in the second half.

Two markers couldn't stop him.

- Park Minho exchanging passes with Gennaro Tatis!

- He breaks through! Lazio's right side is completely breached!

- Minho! He's fast! Increasing his speed, he dives into the danger area! Leo Zannetti rushes to him!

The central defender of Lazio hurriedly rushed to Park Minho, who broke through the flank and charged into the center.

But it was hard for one defender to stop Park Minho, who even two couldn't stop in the second half.

- Marseille turn in front of Leo Zannetti! Minho! Minho! Minho! A shoooot! Gooooal!

- After a scoop turn, a fantastic outside-foot shot shakes the net!

- Wooahhhh! This match is insane! It's tied again! Today's match is epic in every sense!

Park Minho didn't celebrate after scoring.

He simply grabbed the ball from the net and ran to the center line.

It meant he wasn't satisfied with just one goal.

Thomas Strakosha looked at Coach Riccardo Sarri with eyes full of resentment.

'That's why... we should've had a Plan B!'

But this couldn't be helped.

Coach Riccardo Sarri was a manager who insisted on using the 4-3-1-2 formation and his best eleven players.

He was a coach who perfected one tactic and a starting eleven like a craftsman, winning several tournaments.

This had its advantages, but as Thomas Strakosha thought, it could feel tactically frustrating.

He would never have imagined that this would be the case now.

Anyway.

Back to a 3-3 tie.

Coach Sarri tried hard to introduce variations within his perfected Plan A.

But that wasn't enough to stop Park Minho.

Unless there was a different Plan B, the current tactics couldn't stop Park Minho.

Coach Riccardo Sarri didn't accept that.

It was his tactical philosophy.

He was a coach who perfected Plan A and won many tournaments, making it hard to let go.

- Goooal!

- Minooooo! A long-range shot that puts them ahead 4-3!

- Parma takes the lead again with 4-3!

- Ennio Tardini hosts the best match of the season today!

But he eventually had to realize.

That against Parma with Park Minho, Plan A alone wouldn't be enough.

* * *

I ran with the ball again.

I couldn't be satisfied with a multi-goal performance.

As soon as I saw the sign saying "Where has Parma's god gone?" in the away section, I thought of scoring a hat-trick.

Wooooaaahhh!

Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!

As I went wild, the Parma home fans finally started chanting my name in cheers.

Thinking about how they must have been on edge throughout the close first half made me feel a bit sorry.

But I had no intention of disappointing them in the second half.

Throughout the first half, while sticking with Lazio's two markers, I had fully grasped the situation.

Now, the ball was at my feet again.

Lazio's two markers.

Sumet and Felipe rushed toward me with tense expressions.

- Minho! Lightly nudging the ball and turning left past Sumet!

- A flustered Sumet tries to grab Minho, but Minho's feet are already faster!

- Stretching jersey! But Minho! He doesn't fall and manages to get past Sumet!

The jersey seemed a bit stretched.

But the opponent fell.

I endured and dashed down the now empty flank.

The problem was those two sticking closely to me; the rest of the defense wasn't much to worry about.

To be honest, apart from those two marking me, Lazio's defense was weaker than Inter's.

Tap-tap!

Lightly bypassing Leo Zannetti in the center, I saw Lazio's goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha, rushing out to narrow the shooting angle.

That goalkeeper had a quick sense.

That's why I dislike players with quick senses.

I thought he was a really good goalkeeper.

But.

Bam!

Wham!

- Gooooal! Minho! Hat-trick! Minho's hat-trick! Lazio falls behind 5-3 in an instant!

- What a fantastic shot! Despite striking hard from this position, the ball accurately aimed for the corner of the net!

- This isn't Thomas Strakosha's fault! Minho perfectly finished the shot!

The angle of the shot.

The power in the ball.

It was all perfect.

So... it was a perfect shot.

Now that I've scored a hat-trick.

It's time to show these guys who I am.

As I quickly ran to the away section, the stadium guards nearby became very tense.

There was nothing special.

[Where has Parma's god gone?]

I just went to the guy holding that sign and turned around to point my two thumbs at my jersey number 24.

Showing that the player with this number was Parma's god.

The Lazio away fans couldn't even think of throwing anything.

They just stared back in frustration.

The Lazio fan holding the sign lowered it with a sullen expression.

Seeing that, I quickly moved away from the away section.

The referee pointed out that it was too dangerous a move.

I lightly apologized and returned to my position.

Lately, I've been thinking.

I probably won't be able to play in Serie A for long.

I'll have to escape to another league after this season.

If I keep playing like this, I'm scared I'll get shot someday.
