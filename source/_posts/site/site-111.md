## Winter Transfer Market (2)

- KingWangJjangJuve: Ah....... I'm so jealous! Arsenal!
- RealMilan: 121 days hoping for Park Minho's return to Serie A!
- LoveMilano: As expected! You gotta bash Man U for the best taste!
- Roberto: Mino....... I miss you.

The match between Arsenal and Man U.

Park Minho's friends, who had a rare day off, were talking about today's game in the group chat.

- KingWangJjangJuve: Ah, so is Pedro Ocampos coming to Juve? There's just a ton of rumors.
- RealMilan: Isn't Lucas Ocampos a downgrade? Honestly, does Juve have any reason to take him?
- KingWangJjangJuve: Look at Dybala's age. I think it's time to choose a successor.
- Roberto: I'm jealous.
- KingWangJjangJuve: What's up with him now?
- LoveMilano: Parma is 10th in the league right now. Plus, their Champions League round of 16 opponent is Barcelona.

The conversation soon shifted to the clubs they each supported, and then to transfer market rumors.

During this time, the first half ended and the second half began, with Man U showing a much sharper performance, raising the hopes of their fans.

Of course, soccer fans who didn't like Man U were praying that Arsenal would withstand the attack and score a beautiful counterattack goal to extend their lead.

- KingWangJjangJuve: Please lose! Lose! Lose! Lose! Lose!
- RealMilan: You really hate Man U, huh.
- KingWangJjangJuve: No, Man U needs to fall out of the Champions League spots so that Frenkie de Jong comes out in the transfer market, don't you think?
- RealMilan: (Realization! Icon)
- LoveMilano: Please come to AC Milan, the greatest club in Serie A, Mr. de Jong!
- Roberto: Won't he go back to Barcelona?
- RealMilan: Nope, Barca can't handle their debts, so selling Frenkie de Jong isn't crazy, lol.

The group chat was also rooting for Arsenal's victory.

Although for slightly different reasons, they too were hoping for Man U's defeat.

While everyone was praying for Man U's loss, coach Helge in the technical area was praying desperately for just one goal.

"If we concede another goal here, we'll collapse quickly just like in the League Cup quarterfinals. We must equalize!"

In such a situation, the additional goal that coach Helge feared so much was scored.

De Gea goalkeeper perfectly blocked Park Minho's shot, but in the ensuing chaos, Arsenal's fullback Kasper Nielsen pushed the second ball into the net, finally securing the goal.

- Gooooooal!
- Arseeenal! This is reminiscent of the Boxing Day match!
- Despite rotating about half the squad, they show no sign of weakness against Man U!

Coach Helge felt frustrated.

Despite having a squad he was proud of for its quality this season, they couldn't properly target Arsenal's goal, which was tightly defended like a turtle.

What was even more annoying was losing to coach Alain Levagne, who was throwing a fit in the technical area.

"Why is his reaction getting on my nerves more and more?"

It was just a coach happy about a goal, but it was oddly irritating.

Coach Helge encouraged his players.

He shouted loudly towards the field.

But the gameplay didn't change much.

In fact, they exposed weaknesses again to Arsenal's counterattacks, facing crisis situations.

- Mino! He grabs the ball and sprints!
- One player! And another!
- Mino swiftly gets past two players! He's fast! Minoooo! He shoots!
- Gooooooal! Mino, who swiftly got past two players, scores a decisive goal!
- The score now extends to 3-0!

Coach Helge, with a blank expression, watched the field.

Park Minho, who passed by him, lightly hugged coach Alain Levagne, celebrating Arsenal's third goal of the match.

* * *

"Waaaahhhhhh!"

"Mino! Mino! Mino! Mino!"

"Mino is a god!"

"We've won both matches against Man U!"

As the second half was nearing its end, the Emirates Stadium roared as if an earthquake had struck.

The cheers from the Gooners and the thunderous applause echoed across the field.

When Park Minho was substituted, the home fans gave him a standing ovation.

This was a testament to how exceptional Park Minho's performance was today, signaling he was the top contributor to the victories in both matches against Man U.

"How much is that player's worth again?"

"Fxxk, he's 3 million pounds cheaper than that idiot David Seybalt from Tottenham!"

"Ughhh! Minooo! Why don't you have a jersey? Jade Kroenke! When will Mino's jersey be available?"

"Stupid Man U! We have Mino!"

Park Minho, leading the applause from the fans, joyfully left the field.

He even smiled and waved at a young fan along the way.

As he, the core of Arsenal's overwhelming attacking lineup, left the field, the match tilted back towards Man U slightly.

But with little time remaining, Man U couldn't leverage their newfound advantage, and the game ended before they could make any significant impact.

Peep! Peeep! Peeeeeep!

As soon as the referee blew the whistle, Arsenal secured a 3-0 victory over Man U.

[Helpless Man U! Crumbles 3-0!]

[Overwhelming Attack! Man U dismantled by Arsenal's attacking leader, Mino!]

[Two goals exploded! Mino named MOM again in this match!]

[Park Minho scores his 31st goal of the season! How many more attacking points will he record this season?]

[Park Minho needed no time to adapt to the league!]

- Minoooooooo! Marry meeeeeeeee!

- No one missed today's match against Man U, right? I don't think any Gooner would be such a fool.

- Ka! This is it! This is Arsenal! This is it!

- Ronaldo? In the end, he's just a has-been overshadowed by Mino! It's Mino's era nowoooow!

- Mino! Mino! Mino! Mino!

- So they're saying he's moving to Real Madrid this winter?

- Fxxk off. Fxxking Madrid!

* * *

As Arsenal quickly secured victories in the two matches against Man U, the media eagerly started tearing into the defeated Man U.

Honestly, it was a bit scary to watch, but why do the media enjoy tormenting the wounded?

I don't get it.

Still, seeing a rival team crumble is somewhat entertaining.

It's like watching a fire across the river, isn't it?

Yeah, I guess the pleasure in bashing other teams comes from this kind of feeling.

"That's right! Fxxking Man U cut!"

Look at Monica.

It's been a long time since I've seen her this spirited.

No, her reactions and emotional range were particularly large whenever she watched the replays of this match.

Isn't this the charm of a rivalry match?

Anyway.

Arsenal, having cleanly won the first match of the new year, secured a 6-0 victory against Norwich, a team struggling in the relegation zone.

Lorenzo Lupo recorded a hat-trick for the first time in a while.

After scoring the last goal, he grabbed the broadcast camera and shouted "We go Norwich!" which became quite the topic.

"Those bad guys always picking on Liverpool."

The physical trainer, an ardent Kop, said, and Lorenzo Lupo grinned, jokingly saying, "Should I score four goals next time?"

"People, you know, too much is a problem."

"Hmm....... I don't think that's something Mino should be saying."

"What?"

"I think Mino needs to take a good look at himself."

At Tyler Smith Rowe's words, I thought, 'I'm not that bad......'

But I couldn't help but zip it when he showed me my past behavior on his smartphone.

Alright, enough chit-chat.

Our next opponent after beating Norwich is Southampton in the first leg of the League Cup semi-finals.

A team that, contrary to expectations of falling into the lower ranks, is fiercely competing for the 7th spot in the EPL, and recently discovered a promising talent that's making big clubs drool.

That's the current Southampton.

In fact, they have one of the lowest defensive stats among the big three clubs: Arsenal, Liverpool, and Man City.

Their scoring is decent too, so there's a good chance they might qualify for the Europa League or the Europa Conference League this season.

Hmm....... If I think of the most memorable player in the current Southampton, it's definitely this player.

Jules Kaembe.

A young wing-back for Southampton, now 21 years old.

Why do I remember this guy? Because he's rumored to be insanely fast.

He's famous for being one of the three great horses in the popular soccer management simulation game 'Soccer Manager.'

Of course, in reality, he's recorded a disappointing 0 goals and 0 assists in 9 appearances this season.

When asked why I'm interested in Jules Kaembe, I think this guy would do really well if he played as a forward instead of a wing-back.

It might be a bit of a ridiculous reason, but whenever I see him, I can't help but think of Gareth Bale I saw on MeTube a long time ago.

Bale also started his career at Southampton, which leaves a strong impression in my mind.

He's not a very threatening player as a wing-back, so I didn't pay much attention, but he's definitely a player to watch out for, so I shared my thoughts about him with our coach.

As a wing-back, he's at a Championship level, but if used as a winger, he might show more explosive movements than Gareth Bale did at Tottenham, so we need to be cautious.

After hearing my words, the coach's eyes changed.

I worried that I might have crossed a line.

But I realized the meaning in those eyes.

It was the look of a fanatic worshiper staring at a deity.

"Mino....... You're a god!"

"What?"

"Hahaha! Yes! This is it! This is what I'm talking about!"

"......."

"The god of soccer is helping me! Hahaha!"

I thought our coach had gone mad.

But that wasn't the case.

[Pedro Ocampos transfers to Juventus! Arsenal receives 42 million euros!]

[Arsenal signs Southampton's wing-back Jules Kaembe!]

[Arsenal spends 12 million euros to acquire Jules Kaembe!]

[Clear overpay! Experts say Arsenal's acquisition of Jules Kaembe is likely to fail!]

[Jules Kaembe's EPL career record is 32 appearances, 1 goal, and 1 assist!]

[Is he merely a backup for the often injured Tyrone Tierney? Why did Arsenal sign Jules Kaembe?]

Contrary to Park Minho's worries, there was quite a bit of preparation for this acquisition.

When they decided to transfer Pedro Ocampos, the club board and coach Alain Levagne agreed to bring in a winger during the winter.

With wingers like Tyler Smith Rowe, Gabriel Martinelli, and Bukayo Saka often picking up minor injuries, they desperately needed to sign a winger this winter.

The problem was that there were no suitable players available.

There were links with a few players, but before winter came, all they heard was news of contract renewals.

The remaining players had extremely high price tags of at least 30 million euros, despite their skills or potential.

As a result, Arsenal's scouting team, the football director, and coach Alain Levagne had no choice but to rack their brains.

Spending at least 30 million euros on a mediocre player would surely be a waste of money.

In such a situation, Park Minho said to coach Alain Levagne:

- Our next opponent, Southampton, has a 21-year-old wing-back. If this guy plays as a winger, he could be as threatening as Gareth Bale. We need to be cautious.

Coach Alain Levagne couldn't help but shiver as if struck by lightning upon hearing this.

He trusted Park Minho's vision more than anyone.

The tactical movements he showed at Parma and the sharp analysis he displayed when targeting opposing defenders were far beyond the level of an ordinary player.

Honestly, a small worry that he might be overreacting was neatly tucked away in the right atrium of his heart.

This was a gamble worth 12 million euros.

For Arsenal, it was a relatively cheap bet.

And coach Alain Levagne was willing to pay 12 million euros for this bet.

A few days later.

Southampton's wing-back.

Jules Kaembe appeared at the training ground.

In front of everyone's eyes, the test for Jules Kaembe's transition to the winger position began.
