## 31. Summer, Transfer, Rest (2)

Arsenal has quite a bit of money.

They struggled because the club owner, Stan Kroenke, was incredibly stingy in spending it.

When his eldest son, Jade Kroenke, took the lead and started spending, Arsenal made some decent signings, but most of them turned out to be failures.

In that situation, Arsenal invested a lot of money and human resources in acquiring Park Minho, betting everything on it.

To be honest, the success rate wasn't very high.

That's because many clubs were interested in Park Minho.

But then... a player became a free agent.

[Haaland! On the market as a free agent this summer!]

Everyone turned their attention to Haaland, who had no transfer fee.

No matter how incredible Park Minho's scoring ability was, his professional debut was only two years ago.

It was natural for the spotlight to be on Haaland, who had more career and experience.

Additionally, the fact that Haaland was younger played a part.

Moreover, since Park Minho had only played one season in a top European league, investing excessively in him was burdensome.

Thus, other clubs prioritized Haaland.

After all, Park Minho had a buyout clause, so there was no rush.

But Arsenal was different.

They didn't focus on Haaland.

They already had Lorenzo Lupo, a similar type of player except for scoring ability.

"Only Mino…!"

Jade Kroenke prayed earnestly.

He wished his gamble would succeed.

Finally, his smartphone rang.

He quietly answered the call.

"Did it go through?"

Soon, a man's voice came from the other end, and Jade Kroenke quietly leaned back on the sofa.

"Thank you for your hard work."

Ending the call, he looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath.

* * *

Many were curious about Park Minho's transfer.

-Which club will he transfer to?

Most pointed to big clubs.

Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, etc.

They believed that these clubs, with their reputation and financial power, could afford a fantastic striker like Park Minho.

Of course, other clubs showed interest as well.

A striker who scored over 30 goals in a season had a buyout clause of just 52 million euros.

As the financial situation gradually improved with the containment of the COVID-19 variant, the price was attractive to many clubs.

At the prime age of 26.

His stunning performance in Serie A.

And his clutch ability to turn games around in major matches in the Europa League.

Many fans prayed.

They wanted this player to be their striker.

And finally, the official video of the player they desired was uploaded on a video site.

-Hahaha! The late bloomer steps onto the Serie B stage.

It started with a Serie B match for Parma.

The scene showed a player with jersey number 24 slowly stepping onto the field.

The commentators expressed their doubts about the player.

And then several matches flowed by like a panorama.

The commentators' screams echoed again.

-Ahhhhhhhhh!

-Minooooooooooo!

-Hattrick! Hattrick! Minooooo! He brings victory to Parma! It's incredible!

Every match.

The video continued to show this player scoring goals, capturing everyone's attention.

Serie B championship.

Two consecutive Coppa Italia victories.

Serie A championship.

And finally, the Europa League championship.

The scene showed Park Minho lifting the trophy.

And at the end of the video, there was a scene of him bidding farewell to Parma fans.

-See you again, Great Parma!

The next emblem that appeared was Arsenal's.

And then, there was a recording of Park Minho greeting Arsenal fans in English.

-Nice to meet you. Great Arsenal!

The video ended with someone wearing Arsenal's jersey number 10 turning around.

[Park Minho transfers to Arsenal!]

[Mino's choice was Arsenal!]

[An unbelievable transfer! Not Man City, Real Madrid, PSG, or Liverpool, but Arsenal!]

[Arsenal signs Mino, who is closest to the top 3 in this year's Ballon d'Or!]

[How did Arsenal, who advanced to the Europa League, outbid other Champions League teams?]

[Park Minho reportedly receives the highest salary in Arsenal's history!]

[Arsenal hastily sold Lacazette and Aubameyang to sign Park Minho!]

Countless articles poured in.

That's how unusual Park Minho's choice was.

A player who won the Europa League bypassed Champions League teams to join Arsenal.

So people searched for other reasons.

Why did Park Minho go to Arsenal?

And they found out that Park Minho signed with overwhelming wages and Arsenal's promise to establish a youth football center in Korea and transfer their know-how.

As soon as this news broke, Korean football communities were flooded with posts about Park Minho.

-Household name Minho!

-Victorious Arsenal fans, gather here!

-King. Emperor. God. Arsenal.

-Damn... those Arsenal fans are crawling out again.

-Leave them alone... They have nothing else to boast about except the Invincibles season... We should let them be.

-Haha, Park Minho will become the next '77' and once he leaves Arsenal, he'll regain his Parma form and soar high again, lol.

-Go! There’s that Man Utd fan! Drag that guy out!

-From now on, this gallery will be ruled by the victorious Arsenal fans!

-Seriously… How much they must have held back to do something like this?

Various communities were thrown into chaos.

Especially Arsenal, having suffered much in the past, was showing signs of repeating the history of another club.

-King Arsenal! God Arsenal! Emperor Arsenal!

-The brightly shining Arsenal emblem. JPG

-If you're Korean, please support Arsenal!

-Is it now 'Our Arsenal'?

-Seriously… Korean football communities are being ruined by Man Utd fans.

-Those Arsenal fans are so happy.

-But compared to the real thing, this is fake madness, lol. Look at those Man Utd fans from the past; it speaks for itself, lol.

Arsenal fans were that happy.

No matter how much money they invested, the results never came, but now Park Minho, who was credited with leading Parma to victory single-handedly, transferred to Arsenal.

However.

The various football communities didn't anticipate it.

That something even more persistent than this would reappear.

[Shin Junseo! Shocking transfer to Man Utd!]

[Shin Junseo becomes a Man Utd player!]

[Manchester United makes a big investment this summer by signing Derick De Jong and Shin Junseo!]

An enormous piece of news broke.

And upon seeing the news, a user on an overseas football community left a devastated comment.

-The Man Utd fans are coming! The Man Utd fans are coming! The Man Utd fans are coming! The Man Utd fans are coming!

* * *

I couldn't understand it.

Someone who wanted to win joined Man Utd?

Why there?

There must have been better clubs.

Well… Everyone has their circumstances.

I believed that.

Anyway.

Even though I transferred to Arsenal, with Junseo hyung moving to Man Utd, the Korean North London Derby was canceled.

But now there was an even more incredible match… Korean broadcasters with EPL rights must be thrilled.

The next happiest people might be the fried chicken shop owners.

The shop owners would eagerly await weekends.

And if there was another person who would be happy about my transfer to Arsenal, it would be 'her.'

Yes, it was 'Monica.'

Of course, it was different when she first heard the news.

When I told her about my transfer to Arsenal.

She told me no to moving to Arsenal.

Despite her love for Arsenal, she said it was a waste of my career to spend it at Arsenal.

"Are you really an Arsenal fan?"

When I asked her this, Monica shook her head.

She said she was an Arsenal fan, but no meant no.

So, I explained briefly.

I planned to establish a youth football center in Korea to ensure that people like me wouldn't have to leave, and that's why I transferred to Arsenal, who promised to pay a lot and transfer know-how related to youth football.

Only then did Monica reluctantly nod.

And from that moment, the real madness began.

Now that she could wholeheartedly support 'Arsenal's Park Minho,' she became almost like an 'otaku.'

The Serie A alumni group chat was also noisy due to my transfer.

-TrueMilan: Ah... What’s the point of watching Serie A now?

-LoveMilano: Monica must be happy. She can see Minho play at Arsenal.

-Roberto: Mino… I loved you. Sniff!

-KingWangJjangJuve: You'll come back someday, right? Please say you'll come back!

My friends lamented that a superstar had left Serie A and flattered me excessively.

I heard some experts said that Serie A clubs should have made a more aggressive effort to keep me.

If I had continued playing in Serie A, they said Serie A might have surpassed the Bundesliga if not for La Liga.

Honestly, I don't know about that.

But I can say this for sure.

Summer in London is definitely different from winter.

As I stepped out of the London airport, I could see it.

The different appearance of summer in gloomy London.

[Alain Levagne appointed as Arsenal manager!]

[Arsenal signs a 3-year contract with Alain Levagne, who wrote a fairytale at Parma!]

[Teacher and student reunite at Arsenal! Alain Levagne and Mino meet again!]

Alain Levagne, who had left Parma, was now heading to Arsenal, where Park Minho had transferred.

When asked why he came to Arsenal, he answered.

-Because Mino is here.

It was true.

Alain Levagne had been torn between Dortmund and Arsenal but decided on Arsenal because of Park Minho's transfer.

To be honest, he had a strong desire to continue working with Park Minho.

Fortunately, his dream came true.

He became the manager of Arsenal.

Upon joining Arsenal, Alain Levagne quickly began releasing and signing players.

First, he released players who were highly paid but underperformed.

[Arsenal sells John Connor for 29 million euros!]

[Manager Alain Levagne sells 8 players, raising nearly 200 million euros!]

[What kind of squad will Alain Levagne build for Arsenal?]

"Central midfielder."

Arsenal had a good midfield, but it was still lacking in some areas.

Especially in needing a midfield warrior to assist Axel Odegaard and Bernard Partey.

Recognizing this, manager Alain Levagne signed Marco Torreira from Sporting.

A typical warrior-type midfielder.

Additionally, he brought in Liam Murray from the Championship in England at a low cost.

In a short time, Alain Levagne filled the midfield with two players and finally managed a big signing.

[AC Milan's Bruno Campos spotted in London!]

[Bruno Campos joins Arsenal for a fee of 74 million euros!]

AC Milan's key midfielder.

Bruno Campos joined Arsenal.

Naturally, Arsenal fans were ecstatic.

-Is this a dream? It's not, right?

-Mino and now Bruno Campos?

-Is this the Arsenal I know?

-Bruno Campos, known as the all-rounder in AC Milan's midfield, has joined our Arsenal! Hahaha!

-Right! This is it! Unlike that damn Stan Kroenke, his son is different!

-Jade! Exercise full authority forever!

Moreover, when they learned that even after spending all that money, they still had 40 million euros left, Arsenal fans cheered, "This time is different!" in joy.

The only thing left was to sign backup defenders.

Manager Alain Levagne used the remaining 40 million euros to sign backup fullbacks for both sides, ending the transfer market early.

Jade Kroenke asked manager Alain Levagne.

Didn't he sign too many ambiguous players?

Honestly, aside from Park Minho and Bruno Campos, none of the signings could be called big signings.

But manager Alain Levagne was confident.

The squad was much more solid than Parma, and they had Park Minho.

They had Lorenzo Lupo, who had a similar vibe to Kenneth, and many second-line players to support Park Minho.

Moreover, the third line was much richer than Parma.

The defense was also decent.

Manager Alain Levagne clenched his fist confidently.

This squad couldn't fail.
