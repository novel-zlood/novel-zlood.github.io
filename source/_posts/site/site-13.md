## 5. You Can Follow Along in a Day? (2)

The upcoming Serie B Round 2 match against S.P.A.L was quite an important game.

Honestly, every league game was important, but this one was especially so.

S.P.A.L was a team relegated from Serie A in the 19-20 season and had shown a poor performance by finishing 9th in the league during the 20-21 season.

But this season was different.

From the preseason, they had made some significant transfers that were unexpected for a Serie B club, raising people's expectations.

[S.P.A.L's big signing! Alessio Crociata from Lyon! The whale of this Serie B season is S.P.A.L!]

[Daniele Colombo! From Bournemouth to S.P.A.L!]

[Super team of Serie B? Serie B clubs are nervous over S.P.A.L’s shocking transfer market moves]

[Pep Clotet fired! S.P.A.L’s new manager is Martinho Casas! The excellent manager who led Royal Antwerp to 3rd place in the Belgian league last season!]

[S.P.A.L aims for promotion to Serie A this season!]

Despite not being a big club, their new owner invested a considerable amount of money, leading to many changes.

Not just the manager and coaches.

They had completed the renovation of facilities and the stadium.

And even brought in new players to form the team.

The S.P.A.L that finished 9th in Serie B last season was no more.

This season, they were the team closest to promotion.

That was S.P.A.L.

As if to back their bold claims, S.P.A.L won all their preseason friendly matches.

In some ways, the team that could pose the biggest threat to Parma’s promotion was this S.P.A.L.

-Roberto: S.P.A.L's form is no joke these days. I watched the first round of the league, and they won 3-1 against Pordenone, you know?

-Park Minho: Really?

-Roberto: So please win this game and bring good vibes to Parma from the start of the season. There are too many strong teams this season, like Benevento!

Roberto, a die-hard Parma fan, was quite worried.

Moreover, this game was an away match.

Unlike at home, it could be a very tough away game.

I heard that mentally weak friends get really stressed, so I was a bit worried.

I'm quite a scaredy cat.

But I really hope we win the game.

If we win, Roberto promised to buy me dinner.

* * *

The players enter the field.

S.P.A.L’s home ground.

The roar of the crowd filling Stadio Paolo Mazza fiercely hits the ears.

"Will it work?"

Head coach Alain Laban muttered, and Parma’s assistant coach Matteo Vitiello shook his head.

"If you’re that worried, why not place Minho in the center?"

"No. For the future, Minho must be able to play on the wing. We can’t rely on Franco and Santiago alone for the whole season."

"You know that, so..."

He couldn’t say more.

Because he saw head coach Alain Laban's trembling foot.

He was quite nervous too.

Whether this decision was right or not.

That’s why he was more deeply troubled.

Should he change it even now?

In the last game, Park Minho shone in the center, but this time he was placed on the left wing.

In some ways, it was a tactical experiment.

There was considerable risk if this experiment failed.

The only relief was that Franco, who returned for today’s game, could play on the wing, so if it became too concerning, Park Minho could be moved back to the center.

"Still, it’s a relief."

"Hmm?"

"That the opponent is S.P.A.L."

They were a strong team.

Since they had overhauled half their squad this season, they were showing a formidable presence.

Conversely, they didn’t only have strengths.

Their still shaky defensive organization was noticeable.

"Yeah, we’re facing a team that, despite being strong, has a defense as fragile as sand grains. In some ways, it’s fortunate."

Early in the game.

The performance of both teams was evenly matched.

Lacking defensive organization, S.P.A.L gradually increased their possession and attacked.

In contrast, Parma, centered around Franco, who had just returned from injury, showed a defensive-first and counter-attack style of play.

"Will Minho be able to perform in the actual game as well as he did in training?"

Head coach Alain Laban cautiously rubbed his chin.

Assistant coach Matteo, observing him, smiled.

"He will definitely show it. He’s a player who’s more talented and harder working than anyone."

Just then, the ball headed towards Park Minho on the left wing.

Head coach Alain Laban and assistant coach Matteo's eyes focused on Park Minho.

* * *

Until the 10th minute of the first half, the ball didn’t come to me.

In other words, I hadn’t touched the ball even once.

I thought I couldn’t chat on the field.

The S.P.A.L defender sticking close to me.

In other words, S.P.A.L’s right wing-back, Carlito Del Prato, and I exchanged a few words.

Saying S.P.A.L sounded like swearing.

S.P.A.L.

Oh, it’s not a curse.

It’s the team name.

Anyway, we had a decent conversation.

Of course, it wasn’t a long one.

"First time on the wing?"

"Yeah."

Since the ball hadn’t come to the wing as much as I expected, I had only short exchanges with Carlito who was often close to me.

"Is it tough? The wing is originally like that."

"So I practiced by watching videos of famous players."

"Who?"

"Hazard."

He smirked.

Why laugh at Hazard?

Shaking his head, he said,

"You really think you can follow him?"

I couldn’t answer.

Because the ball finally came to me for the first time today.

Carlito also closed his mouth and moved as the ball came to me.

Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo!

The loud booing of the home fans could be heard.

Though Parma’s away fans were singing a cheer song from afar.

The booing was so loud that the cheer song was drowned out.

At the same time, the home fans cheered loudly as Carlito, S.P.A.L’s defender, blocked my path.

Early in the first half, S.P.A.L, who had gained the initiative, was riding the momentum with three or four effective shots.

Moreover, with the team’s expectations rising due to the unprecedented investment, the home fans' voices were even louder.

If it weren’t for Parma’s legend Giovanni Buffon's fantastic saves, we would have already been trailing 2-0.

Thump! Thump!

Slowly dragging the ball, I advanced gradually.

Carlito’s eyes were fixed on my legs.

So, what should I do now?

How did Hazard do it?

Like this...

With a light move, I broke through.

Wow!

A huge cheer erupted from the away stands.

Because I broke through Carlito, who was blocking my path, with just two touches and penetrated the empty left wing.

Gennaro Tatis cutting into the center.

Seeing him, I crossed the ball without hesitation.

-A high cross!

-Gennaro Tatis heads it down! And shoots directly!

-Gooooooal! When did he come up? Center back Lautaro Valencia scores!

-Hahaha! It’s amazing! Center back Lautaro ran almost 50 meters to handle the ball Gennaro Tatis headed down!

Wow... his stamina is really great.

Honestly, I can’t do that.

"Nice goal!"

After high-fiving Lautaro who scored, I lightly patted Gennaro Tatis’s butt.

I was satisfied with creating one key play.

Also, we scored the opening goal.

As I slowly returned to my position, I saw Carlito, who mocked me earlier, with a scrunched-up face.

Crying over just one breakthrough...

There were still about 30 minutes left in the first half.

* * *

"Ca**o!"

A slang term for male genitals.

Translated literally in Korean, it means "f***ing".

That’s what Carlito, in front of me, was muttering.

So... was it three times already?

This guy was rumored to be a good defender, but he seemed to be struggling against wingers like Hazard.

"Minho!"

Franco passed the ball to me.

I quickly ran to get the ball.

I lightly dodged Carlito, who tried to push me to the side, with an upper-body feint and just ran.

Was my acceleration great?

Carlito was getting farther away from me.

Eventually, another player in the center left his position to block me and occupied the left wing ahead of me.

Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!

Well, I just ran.

I was accelerating.

At the same time, I understood that the opponent couldn't easily push me away.

I just pushed through with my body and penetrated the center, seeing the defender’s face filled with bewilderment.

I guess he didn’t expect me to push through so decisively.

In the end.

The opponent used his last resort.

"Ugh!"

Beep!

He grabbed my uniform and pulled me down.

The referee quickly pulled out a card for the opponent.

The center-back who received a yellow card roughly brushed his hair back and returned to his position.

"Stop running around, you damn kid."

Carlito, who had been tormented by me throughout the first half, growled.

Stop running around.

But my mission today was to run and mess up their left side for 60 minutes, both in the first and second half.

Thanks to that, I was running without worrying about conserving my stamina.

"Hoo..."

It was a free-kick chance.

Franco approached me.

His condition wasn’t too bad today.

But it seemed he wasn’t completely in perfect shape.

His passes were slightly fast or slow.

Well, it was a 3-week injury.

Franco, who returned in just 2 weeks with the help of the medical team.

Even if his physical condition was normal, his body rhythm might not be perfect.

Franco offered me the free-kick.

Though it was a bit close.

I felt I could create a good chance with my left foot, so I agreed.

"Hoo..."

Raising my hand, Gennaro's eyes sparkled.

Feeling like I was going to curve it deeply.

Beep!

With the referee’s whistle, I ran towards the ball.

Boom!

The ball drew a graceful curve.

At the same time, Gennaro Tatis jumped high.

-Minho’s free-kick!

-The slightly curved ball directly to! Directly to Gennaro Tatis! A header! Ah! Saved by keeper Andrea! The ball comes out!

-Gooooooooooooal! Lautaro Valencia! He pushes the ball in!

Today seemed to be the day for Parma’s key defender, Lautaro Valencia.

Like a piece of cake, he easily scored.

I was involved in the play again.

Two key plays today.

Not bad, but... still a bit disappointing.

"Nice kick!"

"It feels good, right? Two goals already."

"Let’s keep it up! Just like this."

Parma leading 2-0.

Today’s game felt good.

* * *

It’s halftime.

"Franco, well done. Santiago and Gianluca will be brought in the second half for the center."

Due to COVID-19, Serie B could substitute up to 5 players until 2022, so head coach Alain Laban replaced the two players who had consumed quite a bit of stamina in the first half.

"Minho, let’s play for another 15 minutes in the second half."

"Yes."

Of course, I would play for about 15 more minutes.

There were no tactical changes.

Unless S.P.A.L changed their tactics first, there was no need to change anything.

And the second half began.

Carlito, who had been tormented by me throughout the first half, came close and muttered when the ball wasn't coming.

"How many months?"

"Huh?"

"How many months did it take to study Hazard? You must have studied for quite some time, huh? I really struggled in the first half."

"Really?"

"But now it’s different. In the second half, I’ll show you what real pressure is."

He seemed quite confident.

He definitely had the right to say that.

His concentration was much higher in the second half, making him a much tougher opponent to break through.

"But... it’s just difficult, not impossible, right?"

Swoosh!

Carlito, who slid excessively.

I ran fast, leaving him behind.

He had a face as if he didn’t know what hit him.

Hey, I have my killer move too.

You’re not the only one who can awaken or something, right?

-Minho! Minho! A Marseille turn to break through Carlito and a direct sprint down the wing!

-Fast! Fast! Fast!

After a graceful Marseille turn, a sprint.

Like before, someone from the center ran out to occupy the space in front of me.

But I won’t let it happen again.

Thump!

A pass to Santiago in the center.

And received it back.

-Breaks through with a 1-2 pass with Santiago! There’s no one ahead! Just the goalkeeper!

-Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!

-Andrea, the goalkeeper, rushes out quickly!

The opposing goalkeeper rushed out in a hurry as if his butt was on fire.

Thanks to that, I could finish cleanly.

Thump!

A clean lob shot.

After confirming the ball going into the goal, I quickly ran towards the away stands and slid.

Minooooooo!

Parma fans chanting my name.

Smiling brightly at them, I returned to my position.

Carlito, with a dazed expression.

Looking at him, I answered his earlier question.

"You asked how long it took earlier, right?"

"....."

"I could follow it after watching for a day."

"What?"

"You can follow this much after watching for a day, right?"

At my response, Carlito frowned.

He looked at me as if I was annoying.

"Screw off."

Earlier, he was mocking cheerfully.

I don't get why.

I’m not even half as good as Hazard yet.
