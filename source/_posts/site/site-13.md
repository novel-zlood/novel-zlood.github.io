## 5. You Can Follow Along in a Day? (2)

The upcoming Serie B Round 2 match against S.P.A.L was a rather important game.

Honestly, there wasn't a single league match that wasn't important... Especially this match was crucial.

S.P.A.L was a team relegated from Serie A in the 19-20 season and showed a poor performance by finishing 9th in the league last season, 20-21.

But this season was different.

From the preseason, they achieved quite significant transfers that were unexpected for a Serie B club, raising people's expectations.

[S.P.A.L's Big Signing! Alessio Crociata from Lyon! S.P.A.L is the whale of this Serie B season!]

[Daniele Colombo! From Bournemouth to S.P.A.L!]

[A Super Team in Serie B? S.P.A.L's shocking transfer market moves have Serie B clubs on edge]

[Pep Clotet sacked! S.P.A.L's new coach is Martinho Casas! An excellent coach who led Royal Antwerp to 3rd place in the Belgian league last season!]

[S.P.A.L aims for promotion to Serie A this season!]

Even though it wasn't a big club, the new owner invested a considerable amount of money, changing many aspects.

Not only the coach and staff.

The facilities and stadium renovations were completed as well.

And they even recruited new players to form the team.

The S.P.A.L of last season, which finished 9th in Serie B, was no more.

This season, they were the team closest to promotion.

That was S.P.A.L.

As if to back up their bold claims, S.P.A.L won all their preseason friendly matches.

In some ways, the team that could be the biggest obstacle to Parma's promotion was this S.P.A.L.

-Roberto: S.P.A.L's form is no joke these days. I watched the first round, and they won 3-1 against Pordenone.

-Park Minho: Really?

-Roberto: So, I really hope we win this match so Parma can get off to a good start this season. There are too many strong teams this season, like Benevento!

Roberto, a die-hard Parma fan, was also very worried.

Moreover, this match was an away game.

Unlike at home, it could be a very tough away game.

I heard that players with weak mentalities get extremely nervous, which made me a bit worried.

I tend to get scared easily.

But I really hope we win the match.

If we win, Roberto promised to buy me a meal.

* * *

The players enter the field.

S.P.A.L's home ground.

The roar of the crowd filling Stadio Paolo Mazza fiercely hits my ears.

“Will it work?”

At the murmuring of Coach Alain Levagne, Parma's head coach Matteo Vitiello shook his head.

“If you're so worried, why don't you place Minho in the center?”

“No. For the future, Minho must be able to play on the flank. We can't rely on Franco and Santiago alone for the whole season.”

“You know that, yet...”

He couldn't say more.

He saw Coach Alain Levagne's trembling foot.

He was quite nervous too.

Whether this decision was right.

That's why he was more troubled.

Should he change it even now?

In the last match, Park Minho played in the center, but this time he was placed on the left flank.

In some ways, it was a tactical experiment.

There was quite a risk if this experiment failed.

The only consolation was that Franco, who returned for today's match, could play on the flank, so if it was too uneasy, Minho could be moved back to the center.

“Still, it's a relief.”

“Hmm?”

“Because the opponent is S.P.A.L.”

They are a strong team.

They showed a strong performance as they replaced nearly half of their squad.

On the other hand, they didn't only have strengths.

Their still shaky defensive organization was noticeable.

“Yeah, considering they're a strong team, it's kind of a relief to face a team with a defense as shaky as sand.”

Early in the match.

Both teams showed equal performance.

S.P.A.L, with its still lacking defensive organization, gradually increased possession and attacked.

On the other hand, Parma, with Franco just returning from injury, showed a defensive-first, counter-attacking game.

“Can Minho show the level of play he exhibited in training in an actual match?”

Coach Alain Levagne cautiously stroked his chin.

Head Coach Matteo Vitiello looked at the coach and smiled.

“He can definitely show it. He's a talented and hardworking player.”

Just then, the ball headed toward Park Minho on the left flank.

Coach Alain Levagne and Head Coach Matteo Vitiello.

Both of their gazes fixed on Park Minho.

* * *

Until the 10th minute of the first half, the ball didn't come to me.

So, I hadn't touched the ball once.

I thought I couldn't chat on the field.

The S.P.A.L defender stuck to me.

So, I had a brief conversation with Carlito Del Prato, S.P.A.L's right-back, who was often next to me.

S.P.A.L.

It sounds like a curse word.

S.P.A.L.

Oh, it's not a curse.

It's the team name.

Anyway, we had a good conversation.

Of course, it wasn't a long conversation.

“First time on the flank?”

“Yeah.”

The ball didn't come to the flank as much as I thought, so I had a brief chat with Carlito while passing by.

“Is it tough? The flank is always like this.”

“So, I practiced by watching videos of famous players.”

“Who?”

“Hazard.”

He snickered.

Why laugh at Hazard?

Shaking his head, Carlito said.

“Can you follow him well?”

I couldn't answer that question.

Because the ball finally came to me for the first time today.

Carlito closed his mouth and moved as the ball came to me.

Booing!

The harsh booing of the home fans could be heard.

From afar, the away fans of Parma were singing a cheer song.

But the booing was so loud that it drowned out the cheer song.

At the same time, they cheered loudly as Carlito, S.P.A.L's defender, blocked in front of me.

S.P.A.L, which had gained momentum by recording three or four effective shots early in the first half, was taking the lead.

Moreover, the expectations for the team were high due to the unprecedented investment, and the voices of the home fans grew louder.

If it weren't for the fantastic saves of Gianluigi Buffon, Parma's legend, we would have already been down 2-0.

Tap! Tap!

I slowly dribbled the ball forward.

Carlito's eyes were fixed on my legs.

Now, how should I proceed?

How did Hazard do it?

Like this...

If I lightly move and break through?

Wow!

A huge cheer erupted from the away section.

I broke through Carlito, who was blocking in front of me, with just two touches and penetrated the empty left flank.

Gennaro Tatis was cutting in towards the center.

Seeing him, I confidently sent a cross.

-A high cross!

-Gennaro Tatis heads it down to the field! And he shoots!

-Gooooaaal! When did he come up? Central defender Lautaro Valencia scores!

-Haha! This is amazing! Central defender Lautaro ran almost 50 meters to handle the ball Gennaro Tatis headed down!

Wow... He has great stamina.

Honestly, I can't do that.

“Nice goal!”

After high-fiving Lautaro, who scored, I lightly patted Gennaro Tatis's butt.

I'm satisfied since I contributed to the goal.

Having created the first goal for the team.

Slowly returning to my position, I saw Carlito's face, who had laughed at me, all scrunched up.

Getting sulky from just one breakthrough...

There are still about 30 minutes left in the first half.

* * *

“Cazzo!”

A vulgar word meaning male genitalia.

In our language, it directly translates to f**k.

That’s what Carlito, in front of me, was muttering.

So... have I beaten him 3 times already?

This guy was rumored to be good at defense, but he seems to be struggling against a winger like Hazard.

“Minho!”

Franco passed the ball to me.

I quickly dashed to catch the ball.

After lightly tricking Carlito, who tried to push me to the sidelines, with a body feint, I just ran.

I must have some great acceleration.

Carlito gradually fell behind.

In the end, another player from the center came out to block me, leaving his position and occupying the left flank in front of me.

Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!

Well, I just ran.

I had already accelerated.

At the same time, I realized the opponent couldn’t easily push me back.

Just pushing my way through and cutting into the center, the opponent’s defender looked bewildered.

They probably didn’t expect me to charge in so decisively.

In the end.

The opponent used the last resort.

“Uh!”

Tweet!

Pulling my uniform to make me fall.

The referee quickly drew a card.

The central defender who received a yellow card roughly brushed his hair and returned to his position.

“Stop running around so much, you damned kid.”

Carlito, who had been swayed by me throughout the first half, growled at me.

He told me to stop running.

But my task today was to play for exactly 60 minutes and mess up the left side of the opponent.

Thanks to that, I was running without worrying about conserving my energy.

“Phew...”

It was a free-kick chance.

Franco approached me.

His condition wasn’t too bad today.

But he didn’t seem to be in perfect shape yet.

His passes were either slightly fast or slow.

Well, it was a 3-week injury.

Franco, who returned in 2 weeks with the help of the medical team.

Even if the body was normal, the physical rhythm might not be perfect yet.

Franco handed the free-kick to me.

Though it was a bit close.

I thought I could create a good opportunity with my left foot, so I agreed.

“Phew...”

Raising my hand, Gennaro's eyes sparkled.

Kicking it with a long curve.

Tweet!

With the referee’s whistle, I ran toward the ball.

Thwack!

A ball drawing a graceful curve.

At the same time, Gennaro Tatis jumped high.

-Minho’s free-kick!

-The slightly curved ball goes directly! Directly!

-To Gennaro Tatis! Header! Ah! Saved by goalkeeper Andrea! The ball comes out...!

-Gooooooal! Lautaro Valencia! He puts in the deflected ball!

Today seemed to be the day for Lautaro Valencia, Parma's key defender.

He scored the goal as easily as eating cake.

I contributed to this goal too.

Two contributions in today’s match.

Not bad... But a bit disappointing.

“Nice kick!”

“Feels good, right? Two goals already.”

“Let’s keep it up! Just like this.”

Parma leading 2-0.

Today’s match.

It felt good.

* * *

It was halftime.

“Great job, Franco. Santiago and Gianluca will be substituted in the center for the second half.”

Due to COVID-19, Serie B can make up to 5 substitutions until 2022, so Coach Alain Levagne substituted the two players who used a lot of energy in the first half.

“Minho, you’ll play for 15 more minutes in the second half.”

“Yes.”

Of course, I’ll play for about 15 more minutes.

There were no tactical changes.

There was no need to change unless the opponent, S.P.A.L, made tactical changes first.

And the second half began.

Carlito, who had a hard time with me throughout the first half, muttered to me when the ball wasn’t coming.

“How many months did it take?”

“What?”

“How many months did you study Hazard? You seem to have studied for quite a while? I definitely struggled throughout the first half.”

“Really?”

“But now it’s different. In the second half, I’ll show you what real pressure is.”

He seemed quite confident.

He had the right to say such things.

He was definitely more focused than in the first half, making it harder to get past him.

“But... It’s just harder, not impossible.”

Whoosh!

Carlito slid excessively.

Leaving him behind, I ran quickly.

He looked as if he didn’t know what hit him.

Hey, I have a special move too.

You’re not the only one who can awaken or whatever.

-Minho! Minho! A Marseille turn to bypass Carlito and break through the flank!

-Fast! Fast! Fast!

After a graceful Marseille turn, a dash.

The opponent dashed out from the center to occupy the space in front of me.

But I won’t be fooled like last time.

Tap!

A pass to Santiago in the center.

And received it back.

-Minho bypasses with a one-two pass with Santiago! No one ahead! Only the goalkeeper!

-Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!

-The goalkeeper Andrea rushes out!

He must have been in a hurry.

Rushing out like that.

Thanks to that, I could finish cleanly.

Tap!

A clean lob shot.

After confirming the ball went into the goal, I ran quickly and slid toward the away section.

Minooooooo!

Parma fans chanting my name.

I smiled brightly at them and returned to my position.

Carlito, with a blank expression.

Looking at him, I answered his earlier question.

“You asked how long it took?”

“...”

“I could follow after watching for a day.”

“What?”

“You can follow this much after watching for a day?”

Carlito frowned at my answer.

He looked at me as if I was annoying.

“Get lost.”

He was laughing so much earlier.

I don’t get it.

I’m not even half as good as Hazard yet.
