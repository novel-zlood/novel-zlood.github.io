## 48. Another Victory! (2)

[Arsenal! Achieves an undefeated season for the first time in 20 years since the 03-04 season!]

[Arsenal records 32 wins, 6 draws, 0 losses! Making history with 102 points!]

[Gooners roaming around the streets of London!]

[A Gooner’s shout, ‘We achieved what Spurs couldn't!’]

[Liverpool scores 86 points but finishes second in the league!]

[Coach Jürgen Klopp, ‘What an amazing season. I look forward to facing Arsenal in the Champions League next season.’]

[Coach Alain Levagne, ‘We aim to reach higher next season.’]

-Unbeateeeeeeen champions!

-We achieved an undefeated league title, something Spurs couldn’t dooooo!

-Yeeeeees!

-We also won the FA Cup! Next, let’s win the Europa League toooo!

-Too bad! I wanted to see those damn Spurs get relegated.

The Gooners were excited.

The streets of London were bustling due to Arsenal's undefeated victory, and there were even articles about the London police struggling to deal with the Gooners.

On the other hand, Spurs breathed a sigh of relief.

After winning the last match, they managed to stay in the league, finishing 15th.

But no one from Spurs was happy about it.

Originally, Spurs were a strong team in the top ranks.

They had no reason to be satisfied with their current standing.

Now, the only thing Spurs fans wished for was for our Arsenal to lose to Bournemouth in the FA Cup final.

Especially losing by a goal scored by Dane Scarlett, who was loaned from Tottenham.

Anyway.

Let’s move on from the Bournemouth match.

As soon as the league ended, Arsenal broke various records and etched their name in history.

Most goals in a single season.

They scored 131 goals, 3 more than Aston Villa's 128.

Most points in the league.

With 102 points, they rewrote Premier League history.

Seeing that the Best 11 of the year, chosen by the players, was filled with only Arsenal and Liverpool players, Monica had a satisfied smile on her face.

“I love that there isn’t a single stupid Spurs player!” 

Monica’s satisfied smile was particularly radiant.

Thanks to that, I felt at ease too.

If things hadn’t gone well after I transferred to Arsenal, how sad would Monica have been?

I’m really glad things worked out.

* * *

Wembley is a place that brings me great joy.

Since transferring to Arsenal, I haven't lost a match at Wembley, so I have a good impression of it.

[Will Arsenal lift the FA Cup trophy as well?]

[Arsenal’s only defeat this season was in the second leg of the Europa League Round of 16!]

[Football experts agree that Bournemouth must mark ‘Minho’ to win.]

[Minho with 70 goals this season! Just 3 goals shy of Messi's record.]

[Several injuries hit Arsenal right after the league ended! Coach Alain sighs over Kieran Tierney’s frequent injuries!]

The captain was down right after the Watford match.

Rumor had it he was out for the season.

Furthermore, injuries to Liam Murray and Robledo left a big hole in midfield and defense.

Since the 20-21 season until now.

Arsenal has struggled to cover the left flank without Kieran Tierney.

This season, thanks to my active defensive participation and overwhelming attacking power, we could cover the goals conceded from the left side, achieving an undefeated victory.

Moreover, young defender Casper Nielsen was gaining experience and growing, so the absence of Kieran Tierney didn’t feel as significant as before.

However, it didn’t mean we didn’t feel Kieran Tierney’s absence.

The difference in Arsenal’s left side with and without Tierney was evident.

“Phew...”

Casper Nielsen, who played 23 matches this season and recorded 5 goals and 4 assists, had a very tense expression.

He felt it too.

The heavy responsibility of properly filling the captain Kieran Tierney’s position.

For a 21-year-old prospect to cover Arsenal’s excellent fullback was honestly a tough ask.

Despite missing 20 matches due to injury, the public still considered Kieran Tierney as Arsenal’s main fullback.

The Gooners highly rated his performance.

Real Madrid’s interest in Tierney wasn’t just a coincidence.

The only weakness for the nearly perfect Tierney was his frequent injuries.

If only he weren’t so injury-prone, Kieran Tierney would be considered a world-class fullback.

And no one expected Casper Nielsen to perfectly fill Tierney’s shoes.

“Don’t stress too much.”

Despite advice from Magalhães, Casper’s expression didn’t soften.

He seemed to be under significant pressure despite starting in over 20 matches this season.

The final felt different, after all.

I didn’t feel anything special, though.

Anyway.

Only two matches remain.

Both are finals.

I intended to win both remaining matches.

Additionally, I wanted to surpass Messi’s single-season goal record of 73.

That way, I wouldn’t be embarrassed to be called a ‘god’ by Arsenal or Parma fans.

“I can’t wait for the final to start.”

I was confident of winning.

I was confident of surpassing Messi’s record.

All that was left was to wait for time to pass.

And on May 25th.

At Wembley Stadium, Arsenal and Bournemouth.

The players of both teams began to enter the field.

* * *

Ahead of the final, Bournemouth’s main striker Dane Scarlett was visibly upset.

The reason was simple.

People weren’t focusing on Bournemouth and his performance, but solely on the aspect of his match against Arsenal as a former Tottenham player.

“No one cares about the records we’ve achieved. The journalists and football insiders are only focusing on my clash with Arsenal as a former Tottenham player.”

“We are Bournemouth. Even though I’m a loan player returning to Tottenham after this season... the emotions and achievements I felt with Bournemouth don’t change.”

“We are the champions of the Championship league. Although we are champions of the second division... this match is a clash of champions.”

“Respect us.”

With such an interview, Dane Scarlett garnered strong support from Bournemouth fans.

Thanks to him, Bournemouth's morale was through the roof.

The Bournemouth players started hoping for an FA Cup victory fueled by Dane Scarlett’s fundamental remarks, knowing he would return to Tottenham after this season.

The team was united as one.

The expressions of Bournemouth players arriving at Wembley Stadium were more determined than usual.

The same was true for Ronnie Mowbray, the coach.

Starting from his failures in West Bromwich Albion and Celtic, his offers to manage top-tier leagues dried up.

Middlesbrough.

Coventry.

Blackburn Rovers.

After passing through these three teams with poor records, Bournemouth, a strong team in the Championship league, was his last given opportunity.

And he didn’t waste it.

Although his player utilization was poorly rated, his achievement of making Bournemouth the Championship league champion was certainly praiseworthy.

Of course, to Korean football fans, Ronnie Mowbray was considered a quack.

During his time at Albion, he used Kim Doohyeong as a central midfielder, but after an injury, he bafflingly moved him to the wing and eventually stopped using him, ruining Kim Doohyeong’s last overseas career.

At Celtic, he made the odd choice of using Ki Sungyong, who played as an attacking midfielder, in a defensive midfield role, failing to win the league and eventually getting sacked.

Although Ki Sungyong later thrived in a holding role, Ronnie Mowbray’s tactical decisions and player management were far from excellent.

But this time was different.

Ronnie Mowbray was confident.

There were no Korean fans calling him a quack.

His performance with Bournemouth this season was undeniably commendable.

Moreover, all the momentum leading up to the match seemed to favor Bournemouth’s FA Cup victory.

As soon as they entered the locker room, he gathered the players to reiterate the tactics.

“Shake the left side. Without Kieran Tierney, Arsenal’s left wing is naturally unstable.”

“If we can’t stop the opponent’s attack... we just need to score more goals than them.”

“Remember this. Although Arsenal achieved an undefeated league season, we are the champions of the Championship league this season.”

He had been drilling this into the players ever since it was confirmed that Arsenal would be their FA Cup final opponent.

Keep attacking the left side without Tierney.

He repeated this until the players were almost sick of hearing it.

It was that important.

The players knew it, and they listened to Ronnie Mowbray’s words with serious faces.

“Go out there and show them what Bournemouth is made of.”

Finally, it was time to enter the field.

The Bournemouth players left the locker room with confident expressions.

Ronnie Mowbray clenched his fist and thought.

He would give everything in this match.

* * *

-The atmosphere at Wembley Stadium is electric. Today, the FA Cup winner will be decided.

-Who will be the owner of the trophy at the holy land of football! The Gooners at Wembley are somewhat sure of victory. But they can’t be complacent, right?

-Exactly. Their opponent is Bournemouth, who won the Championship league this season and secured promotion.

-Yes, they’re not a team to be underestimated.

The FA Cup final.

As the players stepped onto the field, the crowd roared.

Arsenal players gulped nervously.

Seeing this, some might ask.

-What? These are players who’ve won the League Cup. Can they be this nervous? It’s strange.

To such questions, I would firmly answer no.

No matter how much a player is used to winning, finals always bring nerves.

It’s the same for me.

It would be the same for Messi or Ronaldo.

Finals put a huge burden on players.

This one match can change everything.

Of course, that tension dissipates quickly once they start running on the field, and those who handle that tension and pressure well are considered strong in big matches.

I think our squad handles that tension and pressure well.

-Bournemouth will give their all in this match. The possibility of playing in the Europa League next season hinges on this game!

-Of course, they have to overcome the massive challenge of Arsenal. If not, the dream of Europa League qualification will disappear like morning fog.

Even before the match started, the voices of fans from both teams filled Wembley Stadium.

Arsenal, of course, had the upper hand in this final.

Arsenal’s current squad was too formidable for Bournemouth to handle.

Now, it was time to step onto the field.

-Bournemouth will definitely take an aggressive approach. Sitting back will only result in getting hammered by Arsenal’s fiery attack led by Minho.

-Exactly. The only silver lining is that Arsenal doesn’t have Kieran Tierney.

-Yes, how Bournemouth exploits the gap on Arsenal’s left side will determine the outcome.

Beep!

With the referee’s whistle, the match began.

Bournemouth started by passing the ball around cautiously.

But.

Within 30 seconds of the match starting.

Bournemouth lost possession due to Bruno Campos’ intense pressure, who then sent a long ball forward.

-Bruno Campos’ strong pressure causes Bournemouth to lose possession! The long ball is perfectly received by Lorenzo Lupo’s chest!

-Lorenzo! Seemingly isolated, but he holds onto the ball well and turns his body!

-Lorenzo makes a break! But Bournemouth’s defense is closing in!

A sudden counterattack.

As Bournemouth hurriedly gathered around Lorenzo, 

Tuk!

Lorenzo Lupo sent a pass over the heads of the defenders into the empty space where I was running in.

-Ah! The pass connects to Minho!

-Minho! He’s running with the ball! There’s no one around him!

-Allen Dickie is rushing to chase Minho!

No one was near me. I only saw the goalkeeper rushing out to narrow the angle.

No striker would miss such an opportunity.

Thud!

The sound of the ball hitting the net echoed as Bournemouth’s goalkeeper Juan Jurinho looked helplessly at the goal.

-Gooooooal!

-Minho scores a goal within just one minute of the match! Amazing!

-Minho! Minhoooo!

-Arsenal takes the lead just one minute into the first half! Bournemouth starts the half in the worst possible situation!

Screeeech!

Sliding in front of the stands with my arms wide open.

The Gooners cheered loudly at my celebration.

Minooooo!

Damn! Insane! Minho!

Waaaaah! We’re lifting the FA Cup too!

God is with us!

It looked like the tension and pressure on our players’ faces had somewhat eased.

What?

A clash of champions?

Ridiculous.

We’ll show Bournemouth the true meaning of being the kings of the EPL.
