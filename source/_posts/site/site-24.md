## 10. What Does It Mean to Lose? Does Such a Thing Exist? (1)

After the match with Lecce.

If I were to express the atmosphere in both Parma and South Korea, I think this phrase fits best:

Bustling.

It was really bustling.

Of course, not all of South Korea was like that.

But for Koreans who watch international football, they were reacting to my 68-meter run that appeared in a Mitube video.

Oh, and this dribble was officially measured at 68 meters and made it into the news.

That’s a bit disappointing.

Still, unlike Sun Junseo-senpai, I did a Marseille turn in the middle... Can I win the Puskás Award?

Looking at the articles, there doesn’t seem to be any issues.

[Parma! Incredible comeback win! Achieves a 3-2 reversal despite being down a player!]

[Minho Park records 1 goal and 1 assist! Selected as MVP again in this match!]

[An incredible goal worthy of the Puskás Award! Can Minho Park win the Puskás just like Sun Junseo?]

[Comments]

-Pub Owner Oooooooo!

-Wow! Just about 3 months ago, I was an ordinary person, but now I'm Parma's ace, a national team player, and a Puskás nominee? Bwoosh Bwoosh Boom?!

-Seriously, hahaha, football like Sun Junseo, life like Minho Park, hahaha.

-Wow... Seeing the clean Marseille turn in the middle and pushing away the player who was trying to body check... Isn't he a real hexagon winger? What's lacking?

-Honestly, when Coach Pedro included him in the national team just a month after his pro debut, I thought he was crazy, hahaha.

-I thought he took a bribe, hahaha.

-Is it true that such a player can play decently as a forward and also play well in the defensive midfield?

-Really... He’s versatile and very skilled.

-Hahaha, tapping the Parma emblem with his left hand while pointing at the Taegukgi with his right hand? National pride is deliciousiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

-Delicious is a Japanese word. Please correct it to say national pride is tasty.

-Enough! So when is Minho Park's next match?

The reaction in Korea was hot.

Of course, the reaction in Parma was also hot.

Sometimes, seeing them worship me like a god felt oddly scary.

Thanks to that, I could feel the enthusiasm for football in Italy.

Even the group chat was in chaos.

Friends were excitedly arguing about bringing their favorite clubs, and I saw Roberto jumping in, saying he would make me a Parma legend.

Then, Monica sent me a private message.

-Monica: Why Sun Junseo of all people?

-Monica: Huh? Minho?

-Monica: Answer quickly. Huh?

It’s a bit scary.

Really... Arsenal seems to be jinxed somehow.

I hope Arsenal can lift the league trophy this season.

Anyway.

To calm Monica, I promised to show a play that Arsenal's legend had shown.

-Minho Park: Then next time, I'll show you Van Persie's diving header goal!

But something felt off.

Even though my message went through and the "1" next to the message disappeared, Monica didn’t reply.

What the... Did I make a mistake?

* * *

Santiago.

The slacker.

Argentinian sausage.

He has many subtly dumb nicknames, but.

He’s a guy with great talent.

In 8 league matches, he has 2 goals and 3 assists.

He’s showing excellent performance, but.

He’s oddly fragile.

He has quite a bit of inconsistency, showing worse than amateur performances in some matches.

But in other matches, he shows such fantastic performance that even Messi would be jealous, dominating the game.

Besides his inconsistency, he always shines in big matches.

Both in the Argentine league and here in Serie B, he always showed incredible performance in matches against strong teams.

“Like this?”

“That’s right. Move like that so the opponent can’t easily predict your move from the side.”

Anyway, today I trained with this slacker and our team’s key defender, Lautaro Valencia.

Lautaro has a strange prince syndrome?

No, should I call it an axe syndrome?

He’s a friend with a weird mental world.

Last time, the slacker, I, Buffon, and Lautaro went to a restaurant.

Lautaro heard the conversation of other diners talking about him and showed all kinds of embarrassing behavior in a burst of narcissism.

Thanks to that, the three of us frowned.

Well, it was still fine.

In the end, Lautaro realized the conversation was about another Lautaro Marcius from Inter, not him, and shut his mouth.

I remember the three of us laughing out loud, and Lautaro turning red-faced, nibbling on his pizza.

Still, he’s a good friend.

Despite his unique mentality, he has better relationships with the players than expected.

He’s passionate about training.

Thinking about it, this friend stays on the training ground as long as the slacker and I do.

His downside?

Despite his narcissistic personality, his play is oddly rough.

Because of that, he often gets carded.

Of course, I once heard Assistant Coach Matteo muttering that such roughness would disappear with more experience.

“Like this?”

“Hey! You idiot! Think! What would a defender think if you move like this? Huh?”

“They’d think I’m going this way...”

“Why move left if you know that?”

The two Argentinians, who are around the same age, have gotten close and bicker a lot.

At some point, their gazes turned to me.

“Minho! I’m right, aren’t I?”

“No, Minho! Look at this fool! Who moves like this with defenders around! Huh?”

“If you move like this, the defender reads it. Such low-probability plays negatively impact the team!”

“But if you break through once like this, the opponent gets significantly shaken, so it’s fine!”

Well, I don’t know either.

Wouldn’t it be enough to move in a way that they can’t block even if they know?

When I shared my opinion, they told me to show them directly.

So I did.

I broke through a narrow space, cleanly bypassing Lautaro, and dribbled the ball for a successful shot.

Returning with the ball, the two’s expressions had subtly changed.

“How about it? Easy, right?”

Their faces crumpled at my words.

What?

Why look at me like that?

* * *

The next opponent is Benevento.

They are a strong team, ranked 2nd in the league.

They might be the team to continue the promotion competition with us this season.

However, Coach Alain Levagne rotated many main players and used the B team.

The result was a 3-1 victory.

Entering at the 30th minute of the second half and recording an assist, I felt a strange sense of futility seeing Benevento crumble much more easily than Lecce.

Then came the match against Reggina 1914.

We won this match 5-2.

I recorded 2 goals and 2 assists, achieving 13 goals and 10 assists this season, totaling 23 attacking points.

And I grabbed the MVP again.

[Serie B]

<League Scoring Rankings>

-1st. Alfredo Donnarumma: 12 goals.

-2nd. Minho Park: 11 goals.

-3rd. Gennaro Tatis: 8 goals.

-4th. Christian Zibtriri: 8 goals.

-5th. Gianluca Lapadula: 7 goals.

Currently, I rank 2nd in the league scoring rankings.

[Serie B]

<League Assist Rankings>

-1st. Minho Park: 8 assists.

-2nd. Riccardo Improta: 5 assists.

-3rd. Luca Zaminakia: 4 assists.

-4th. Franco Vázquez: 4 assists.

-5th. Oliver Krieble: 4 assists.

I ranked 1st in assists.

Man of the Match.

I was selected as the game’s MVP 7 times, and the Italian media showered me with praise, saying I was leading Parma’s offensive line.

Honestly, I was a bit worried that I might need to see a proctologist soon.

Looking at my stats, I realized I was showing unbelievable performance.

Thanks to that, Coach Alain Levagne’s eyes are filled with madness these days...

I wonder if, as Leo said, I can renew my contract in winter and transfer this summer after this season ends.

Anyway.

The next opponent is Pisa.

A team ranked 19th in the league, stuck in the relegation zone.

They have Lorenzo Lupo, a promising Italian striker.

He is likely to be taken by a big club this winter or at the end of the season.

Despite the lack of team support, Lorenzo Lupo showed his prowess by scoring 4 league goals.

Because of him, our coaching staff had to work overtime.

They had dark circles from thinking about how to defend against a 2-meter-tall striker.

Even the prince syndrome Lautaro was aware of Lorenzo Lupo and worked hard in the previous training, running and running.

Not that his jumping ability would suddenly improve.

But how tall does 2 meters mean?

I’m 181 cm... so 20 cm taller.

I was a bit curious.

How would the 21-year-old young striker, whom Serie B expects, perform against us?

* * *

Waaaaaaah!

A huge cheer erupted at the Ennio Tardini Stadium.

The players of Pisa and our team were lined up, waiting to enter the field.

But all my attention was on the 2-meter-tall giant.

Not the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

The Pisa Giant striker.

Lorenzo Lupo.

He was staring ahead with a calm expression.

Honestly, I wanted to talk to him.

But I held back, fearing a misunderstanding.

The recent losing streak had filled the eyes of Pisa’s players with a fierce determination.

I didn’t want to get misunderstood and beaten up.

It was time to enter the field.

Players lined up and entered the field.

The boy holding my hand looked at me with sparkling eyes and almost tripped.

“Are you okay?”

“Yes!”

“What’s your name?”

“Nikola!”

“That’s a nice name.”

“Hehehe...”

The boy wriggled his body at my words.

I wondered if it was such a great compliment, then remembered how I liked even small compliments as a child and nodded.

“Win today!”

I lightly nodded to the boy leaving the field after the event.

Yeah, we have to win.

After shaking hands with Pisa’s players, I headed to my position.

Today I started in the center of the second line.

Lorenzo Lupo, with his huge build, had hands that were like bear paws—big and rough.

My hands are small for my height, making the contrast even more noticeable.

Most of the main attackers are resting today.

Except for Gennaro Tatis and me.

Gennaro looked at me while standing with the ball.

“You can do better than that tall guy, right?”

“He has 4 goals, and I have 11, right?”

“Sorry. I asked a too obvious question.”

Gennaro smiled, looking at the referee.

Soon the referee blew the whistle.

Gennaro passed the ball to me, starting the match.

* * *

15 minutes into the first half.

We were being swayed by Pisa’s reckless set-pieces.

“Block him!”

That 2-meter tall guy was really amazing.

Having such physicality and scoring 4 league goals?

I thought his goal-scoring ability was too much, but then I understood after seeing the pass success rate of Pisa's second line players shown by the analyst.

I respected Lorenzo Lupo.

Pisa’s second line.

They really can’t pass.

So they abandoned all other attack routes and decided to rely solely on Lorenzo Lupo, launching high crosses to induce aerial battles.

In such a situation, Lorenzo Lupo managed to score 4 goals against numerous defenders.

It meant he scored 4 goals despite facing multiple defenders in every match.

I wouldn’t have scored even one goal.

Luckily, today Lautaro is tightly marking Lorenzo Lupo, preventing him from scoring.

But at this rate, we would be giving the initiative to a relegation team and having a tough match.

Since I’m playing in the center of the second line.

Shouldn’t I create something?

“Minho!”

The ball connected to me.

I dribbled the ball forward slowly, looking at the tense Pisa midfielder.

Thud!

When I passed the ball sideways, the Pisa midfielder relaxed and turned his attention away.

At that moment, I sprinted forward.

Surprised, the Pisa midfielder turned back.

The ball was delivered right in front of me.

Nice pass!

Receiving the return pass from Dennis Man, I sped up, feeling the Pisa players in disarray.

All the attackers were running forward.

A sudden, all-out attack.

They couldn’t help but be flustered.

They must have felt a bit relaxed early in the first half, thinking they had the upper hand.

But that ease would end here.

Honestly, they are a relegation team.

We are the league leaders.

We must show them what being at the top feels like.

This time it’s a scoop turn.

Recently, I’ve been using the Marseille turn often, so all the opponents were wary of it.

But I can do other moves too.

The ball slipped through the opponent’s legs.

I rounded the opponent, seeing the surprised look on his face.

The opponent hurriedly reached out.

But I was faster.

The opponent could only collapse.

I sprinted even faster.

Breaking into the danger area, I moved laterally along the right half-space.

Two players invested to push me to the side and block the shooting angle.

But I didn’t just stand there.

I protected the ball with my back and quickly turned to cross with my right foot’s outside.

A beautiful curved cross flew over the three players focusing on me.

It connected precisely to Gennaro Tatis, who jumped high.

I could smile, seeing the perfect cross.

-Goal!

-A fantastic outside foot cross from Minho! A clean header from Gennaro Tatis!

-Amazing! Minho, who has become Parma’s ace just 3 months after his pro debut!

Parma! Minho!

Parma! Minho!

Gennaro! Tatis!

Gennaro! Tatis!

The home fans chanted our names.

The thrilling sensation rose up my back.

Is this what they call ‘buzz’?

I could understand why Lautaro had prince syndrome.

And why Koreans get national pride buzz.

A little bit.
