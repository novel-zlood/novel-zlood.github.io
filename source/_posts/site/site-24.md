## 10. What Does It Mean to Lose? Does Such a Thing Exist? (1)

After the match against Lecce.

If I were to describe the atmosphere in Parma and South Korea, this phrase would fit best:

Buzzing.

It was really buzzing.

Not that the whole of South Korea was like that.

But for Koreans who watch overseas football, they were reacting to my 68-meter breakthrough that appeared in a certain MiTube video.

Ah, and this time the official distance was measured at 68 meters, and it was reported in the news.

This is a bit disappointing.

But unlike senior Shin Junseo, I also did a Marseille turn in the middle... I should be able to win the Puskás Award, right?

Looking at the articles, there doesn't seem to be any problem.

[Comments]

- Jumo-oooooo!

- Wow! Just about 3 months ago, I was an ordinary person, but now I'm Parma's ace, a national team player, and a Puskás Award nominee? Bboong-bbang-boong?!

- Really, lol, play football like Shin Junseo, live life like Park Minho, lolololol

- Wow... Seeing him cleanly execute a Marseille turn in the middle, push off a player in a physical clash, and run... Isn't he really a hexagonal winger? What's he lacking?

- Honestly, when Pedro brought him to the national team just a month after his pro debut, I thought the coach had lost his mind, lol

- I thought he took bribes, lol

- Is it true that a player like this can play well up front and also perform well in the third line?

- Really... he's versatile and highly skilled.

- Lol, patting the Parma emblem with his left hand while pointing to the Korean flag with his right? National pride yummyyyyyyyyyyyy!

- Yummy is a Japanese word. Please change it to "national pride is delicious."

- Enough! So when is Park Minho's next match?

The reaction in South Korea was hot.

Of course, the reaction in Parma was also hot.

Sometimes it was oddly scary to see them worship me like a god.

Thanks to this, I could feel the passion for football in Italy.

The group chat was also in chaos.

Amid friends excitedly arguing over which club they support, I saw Roberto joining in, saying he would make me stay at Parma forever.

And Monica sent a private message.

-Monica: Why Shin Junseo of all people?

-Monica: Huh? Minho?

-Monica: Answer me quickly. Huh?

It's a bit scary.

Really... Something's off with Arsenal?

I hope Arsenal can lift a league trophy this season.

Anyway.

To calm Monica down, I promised to show her a play by an Arsenal legend next time.

-Park Minho: Then next time, I'll show you Van Persie's diving header goal!

But something felt strange.

Even though my message was sent and the "1" next to it disappeared...

Monica didn't reply.

What is this... Did I make a mistake?

* * *

Santiago.

Lazybones.

Argentinian sausage.

He has a lot of subtly dumb nicknames, but...

He's a guy with incredible talent.

8 matches in the league, 2 goals, 3 assists.

He's showing great performance, but...

He's oddly fragile.

He also has quite a bit of inconsistency, showing performances worse than an amateur in some matches...

But in other matches, he shows fantastic form that even Messi would envy and dominates the game.

Moreover, unlike his inconsistency, he always performs in big matches.

In the Argentine league and here in Serie B, he always shows incredible performance in matches against strong teams.

"Like this?"

"That's right. Move like that so the opponent can't easily predict you from the side."

Anyway, today I trained with this lazybones and our team's key defender, Lautaro Valentia.

Lautaro has a weird prince syndrome?

No, should I say an ax syndrome?

He's a friend with a strange mental world.

Last time, Lazybones, myself, Buffon, and Lautaro went to a restaurant.

Lautaro heard some customers talking about him and his narcissism exploded, leading to all sorts of embarrassing acts.

Thanks to that, the three of us frowned.

Well, it was still fun.

In the end, when we realized that they were talking about Inter's Lautaro Martinez, not our prince syndrome Lautaro, he shut his mouth.

I remember us three laughing hard, and Lautaro turning red and nibbling on his pizza.

Still, he's a good friend.

Despite his unique mentality, he has better relationships with the players than expected and trains enthusiastically.

When I think about it, Lautaro stays as long at the training ground as Lazybones and I do.

His downside?

Unlike his narcissistic personality, his play is oddly rough?

Thanks to that, he often gets cards.

Of course, I've heard Assistant Coach Matteo mumbling that this roughness is a flaw that will disappear with more experience.

"Like this?"

"Hey! You jerk! Think about it! Moving like this, what do you think the defender will do? Huh?"

"They'll think I'm going this way..."

"If you know that, why move to the left?"

Two Argentinians of similar age have become friends and are bickering.

Then their eyes turned to me.

"Minho! I'm right, aren't I?"

"No, Minho! Look at this fool! Who moves like this with a defender in front of them? Huh?"

"If you move like this, the defender will read everything! A play relying on such low odds negatively affects the team!"

"No, but if I break through even once, it will shake the opponent badly, so there's no problem!"

Well, I don't really know either, but...

Wouldn't it be fine if you moved in a way that they can't block even if they know?

When I conveyed my opinion, they told me to try it myself.

So I showed them.

I dribbled cleanly past Lautaro in a narrow space and successfully shot.

When I came back with the ball, their expressions had subtly changed.

"See? It's easy, right?"

Their faces frowned at my words.

What's this?

Why are you looking at me like that?

* * *

The next opponent is Benevento.

A strong team, ranked 2nd in the league.

They might be our competitors for promotion this season.

But Coach Alain Lavang rotated many of the main players, fielding a 1.5-string team.

The result was a 3-1 victory.

Entering in the 30th minute of the second half and recording an assist, I couldn't help but feel a strange emotion seeing Benevento collapse much more easily than Lecce.

And then the match against Reggina 1914.

We won 5-2 in this match.

I recorded 2 goals and 2 assists, bringing my season tally to 13 goals and 10 assists, amassing 23 attack points.

And I grabbed another MVP.

[Serie B]

<League Scoring Rankings>

-1st. Alfredo Donnarumma: 12 goals.

-2nd. Park Minho: 11 goals.

-3rd. Gennaro Tatis: 8 goals.

-4th. Christian Zipthiry: 8 goals.

-5th. Gianluca Lapadula: 7 goals.

Currently ranked 2nd in league scoring.

-1st. Park Minho: 8 assists.

-2nd. Riccardo Improta: 5 assists.

-3rd. Luca Zaminakia: 4 assists.

-5th. Oliver Krebil: 4 assists.

Leading the league in assists.

Man of the Match.

In other words, I've been selected as MVP 7 times, and the Italian media showered me with praise, calling me the leader of Parma's attack.

Honestly, I wondered if I'd need to visit a proctologist from all the praise.

Realizing my performance through numbers, I could see that I was showing unbelievable form.

Thanks to this, Coach Alain Lavang's eyes have been gleaming with intensity lately...

I wonder if I can really transfer in the summer after renewing my contract this winter, as Leo mentioned.

Anyway.

The next opponent is Pisa.

A team ranked 19th, stuck in the relegation zone.

A team with the Italian striker prospect, Lorenzo Lufo.

Lorenzo Lufo, who is certain to be picked up by a big club either this winter or at the end of the season, is showing his strength by scoring 4 goals in the league despite lacking team support.

Thanks to this, our coaching staff worked overtime.

They obsessively pondered how to maintain aerial superiority against a 2-meter-tall striker, evident from their dark circles.

Even the prince syndrome Lautaro was conscious of Lorenzo Lufo and worked hard in the previous training session.

Not that his jumping ability would suddenly improve.

But what does it mean to be 2 meters tall?

I'm 181cm, so... he's over 20cm taller.

Thanks to that, I was a bit excited.

How would the young striker, whom Serie B has high hopes for, perform against us?

* * *

Waaaaaaah!

A huge cheer erupted at Ennio Tardini Stadium.

Pisa's players and our team lined up, waiting to enter the field.

But all my attention was on the 2-meter giant.

Not the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

The giant of Pisa.

Lorenzo Lufo.

He was staring ahead with a calm expression.

Honestly, I wanted to talk to him.

But I held back, not wanting any misunderstandings.

The fierce looks in the eyes of Pisa's players, who were on a losing streak recently, were filled with determination.

I didn't want to get beaten up due to a misunderstanding.

Just in time, it was time to enter the field.

The players lined up and entered the field.

The boy holding my hand looked at me with sparkling eyes and almost tripped.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes!"

"What's your name?"

"Nicolas!"

"That's a nice name."

"Hehehe..."

The boy wriggled his body at my words.

I wondered if this was such a great compliment, but then I remembered how even small compliments made me happy as a child, and I nodded.

"Win today!"

As I watched the boy leave the field after the ceremony, I lightly nodded.

Yeah, we must win.

After shaking hands with Pisa's players, I headed to my position.

Today, I start in the central attacking midfield.

Come to think of it, Lorenzo Lufo is not only tall but also has hands as big and rough as bear paws.

Compared to my height, my hands are small, so the contrast might have made it seem more noticeable.

Most of the main forwards are resting today.

Except for me and Gennaro Tatis.

Gennaro, standing with the ball, looked at me and asked.

"Can you do better than that tall guy?"

"He has 4 goals, I have 11 goals, right?"

"Sorry. I asked something too obvious."

Gennaro smiled and looked at the referee.

Soon, the referee blew the whistle.

Gennaro passed me the ball, and the game began.

* * *

15 minutes into the first half.

We were being swayed by Pisa's mindless set pieces.

"Block himmmm!"

That 2-meter tall guy was really something.

Having such physicality and only 4 goals in the league?

I thought his goal-scoring ability was questionable, but then I understood after seeing the pass success rate of Pisa's midfielders shown by the analyst.

I had respect for Lorenzo Lufo.

Pisa's midfield.

They really can't pass.

So they abandoned all other offensive routes and decided to trust Lorenzo Lufo by sending high crosses to induce heading duels.

In such a situation, that tall guy managed to score 4 goals competing against multiple defenders.

If it were me, I wouldn't have scored a single goal.

Fortunately, today, Lautaro is holding onto Lorenzo Lufo tightly, preventing him from scoring.

But if this continues, we'll lose control to a relegation zone team and face a tough game.

Since I'm playing in the central attacking midfield for a change...

I need to create something.

"Minho!"

The ball was passed to me.

Seeing Pisa's midfielder looking at me with a tense expression, I calmly dribbled forward.

Tap!

However, as I passed to the side, the midfielder relaxed and turned his gaze.

At that moment, I sprinted.

The ball flew right behind the surprised Pisa midfielder.

It was perfectly delivered in front of me.

Nice pass!

After receiving the return pass from Dennis Man, I accelerated further, sensing the chaos among Pisa's players.

It was an all-out attack, suddenly starting.

Of course, they were flustered.

They must have felt a bit relaxed, having seized the momentum in the early part of the first half.

But that relaxation ends here.

Honestly, they're a relegation zone team.

And we're the league leaders.

We need to show them what it's like to be number one.

This time, it's a scoop turn.

Maybe because I've been using the Marseille turn a lot lately, all the opponents were wary of it.

But I can do other things too.

The ball slipped through the opponent's legs.

As I rounded the opponent, I caught sight of their panicked expression.

They quickly reached out.

But I was faster.

The opponent ended up sitting down.

I sped up.

As soon as I penetrated the danger zone, I moved horizontally along the right half-space.

The opponent pushed me to the side, investing two players to block the shooting angle.

But I didn't just stand there.

Quickly shielding the ball with my back to the goal.

I turned and crossed with the outside of my right foot.

A beautiful curved cross over the three players focused on me.

I smiled, seeing the cross perfectly connect with Gennaro Tatis's head.

-Goooooal!

-Amazing outside foot cross from Minho! And a clean header from Gennaro Tatis!

-It's incredible! Minho, who has become Parma's ace in just 3 months since his pro debut!

Parc! Minho!

Parc! Minho!

Gennaro! Tatis!

Gennaro! Tatis!

Home fans were chanting our names.

Feeling the electrifying sensation down my back from the enthusiastic cheers.

Is this what they call 'buzz'?

I could somewhat understand why Lautaro has prince syndrome.

And why Koreans get so caught up in national pride.
