## 39. Scoring Competition (1)

Arsenal, having defeated Brighton and gained momentum, also secured a victory in the following Europa League match, thus advancing to the next stage early.

And our next opponent is Manchester City.

After Pep Guardiola left and the new German coach Thomas Boymer took over, Man City has been showing shaky performances.

-Lorenzo Lupo-o-o-o-o!

-Arsenal shakes Manchester City's net at the last minute! The hero is Lorenzo Lupo-o-o-o-o!

-Didn't Minho handle the cross brilliantly?

-That's right.

Even though it was an away match, we managed to secure a 2-1 victory against Manchester City.

Lorenzo Lupo has been surprising experts by showing a completely different performance compared to last season.

Last season, he barely scored 12 goals in the league, but this season he has already scored 10 goals in just 10 matches.

[Is Lorenzo Lupo's revival because of 'Minho'?]
[Arsenal shows a chilling level of offensive power, completely different from last season!]
[Thomas Boymer: 'Arsenal is the closest team to the championship this season. We will definitely win next time.']
[Alain Levagne: 'I could see that the team's organization is coming alive. It was a good match.']

After the Manchester away match.

We returned to London to prepare for departure.

This was for the second round of the North and Central America World Cup Asian Qualifiers.

Upon arriving in Paju, I had the chance to meet our new national team coach.

"My name is Kim Sooryong. Pleased to meet you."

It wasn't a bad appointment as I expected.

Coach Kim Sooryong had led a team in the Chinese league for about three years in the past and had recently promoted a team in the Swiss second division.

Perhaps because he had some achievements, the association seemed quite satisfied with him.

The players also reacted positively.

The tactics matched the current squad.

The key was a low defense and fast counterattacks on the flanks.

Particularly, placing me and Junseo hyung on both flanks reaped significant benefits in counterattack situations.

Thanks to this, we garnered good results as well as performance in the two recent A matches, receiving praise for taking the first steps toward the 2026 North and Central America World Cup.

Anyway.

Back in London after a pleasant consecutive win with the national team.

Seeing the somewhat unsettled atmosphere of the squad at the Arsenal training ground, I sighed.

Actually, the squad atmosphere was good.

Yes, no matter how bad the team's atmosphere is, continuous victories eventually create a good atmosphere.

Just like how even the most entertaining game loses its charm if you keep losing.

In that sense, Arsenal had built a perfect foundation to create a good atmosphere.

However, having built a good atmosphere didn’t mean perfect teamwork.

The internal situation at Arsenal wasn’t completely resolved.

Veteran and young players.

The relationship between the two groups was quite good.

However, the South American group was still struggling to blend in with the squad.

And I could see Pedro Ocampos having a confrontation with our coach on the training ground.

"Show some professionalism, Pedro."

"Coach, I am doing it properly. Don’t you think your rules are too strict?"

Pedro Ocampos is a good player.

However, his frequent tardiness and lack of sincerity in training had been a topic of discussion within the squad.

Naturally, the other players looked at Pedro Ocampos with disapproval.

Other players from the South American group had started mingling with others, but he seemed to be struggling with homesickness, which worried me.

Of course, I had no intention of interfering.

Even if we didn't have Pedro, Arsenal's current attacking lineup was so saturated that we had plenty of resources to replace him.

Rather than helping an unmotivated player like him, I preferred to support more diligent players.

Oh, why did I help the slacker at Parma?

Because there was no substitute for him at Parma.

But Arsenal was different.

There were plenty of attackers like Amani Richards, Bukayo Saka, and Emile Smith Rowe to replace Pedro Ocampos.

Anyway.

After work, I talked about today's events with Monica and shared my thoughts on this topic.

Then Monica shed a tear.

"Minho, I’m so happy."

"Huh?"

"It's the first time in my life hearing that Arsenal's attacking lineup is so rich that they can do without a key player..."

"......"

"Isn't this a dream?"

I couldn't imagine what kind of team she had been supporting.

So, I gently patted Monica and told her.

To enjoy the current Arsenal.

* * *

Ahead of the Everton match, Pedro Ocampos didn't show up at the training ground.

Understandably furious, our coach relegated Pedro Ocampos to the second team.

Thanks to this, Amani Richards, who was treated as the fifth option, got more opportunities.

"Ha-ha!"

Of course, our Amani Richards was so happy that he danced around the training ground.

Seeing him dance out of joy was not very pleasant, so I hit him on the back of his head to bring him to his senses.

He then pouted and wiggled his hips in defiance.

Is he really crazy?

Even the slacker wasn't this bad.

Or...are they on a similar level?

Maybe my memory is romanticized, so I decided to withhold judgment.

Anyway.

In the upcoming match against Everton, Marco Torreira and Bernard Party, who had been out injured, were set to return.

Our coach's expression brightened at the prospect of rotating the team normally again.

And then came the 12th round of the Premier League.

We hosted Everton at home.

After Benitez resigned, Lampard took the helm but was sacked last season due to poor performance.

The current manager of Everton was Rafael Alteiro.

Coincidentally, sharing the same name as Benitez made Everton fans uncomfortable, and their feelings were justified.

At the start of the season.

Everton, which had been collapsing due to a terrible losing streak, had gradually secured wins thanks to Michael Calvert Lewin's one-man show, ranking 11th in the league.

The Everton fans were holding their heads in despair, shouting ‘The second Rafa has arrived!’ as the new manager failed to leave a significant tactical impression, much like Benitez.

Anyway.

Arsenal, with the minor issue of Pedro Ocampos, and Everton, with issues regarding the manager's rigid tactics, gathered at the Emirates Stadium.

"Minho-o-o-o-o! We trust you again today!"

"Keep the winning streak going!"

"Let's show those stupid Everton guys who the current league leader is!"

Arsenal fans, who had earned the nickname 'The Emirates Library' for their relatively quiet support, had recently found their voices.

I thought this was a good reaction.

The loud cheers from fans give players great strength.

In that sense, I wanted to score as many goals as possible in today's match.

Besides, Bruno Campos' passes were sharp today.

I understood why AC Milan had tried so hard to keep him and why their fans cried when he left for Arsenal.

I remembered an AC Milan fan crying in the group chat while looking at the Serie A standings yesterday.

-MilanLove: Bruno... Are you happy there?

Oh, there was another one with a similar reaction.

-Roberto: Minho... Are you happy at Arsenal?

AC Milan and Parma.

Both teams were not doing well in terms of performance or situation.

At least AC Milan was second in the league, but honestly, their performance didn't match their league position and was quite unstable.

On the other hand, Parma had overall good performance but was currently 9th in the league, which was unsatisfactory compared to the previous season.

Thinking of my two friends' suffering, the image of Monica laughing loudly passed through my mind.

Alright, enough idle thoughts.

Given the good pass, shouldn't I give Bruno Campos a proper gift in return?

Tap-Tap!

As I pushed forward into the half-space, the opponent hurriedly threw their body to disrupt my timing.

Of course, I had already set the angle for the shot, so the interference wasn’t a big problem.

A long time since I shot from this course.

The curved shot reminiscent of Arjen Robben made Everton's goalkeeper Jonathan Pickford dive desperately.

Of course, the result didn’t change.

Thud-plash!

-Gooooooal!

-Min-ho-o-o-o! Cuts in from the side and finishes cleanly with a shot in the half-space!

-A curved shot reminiscent of Robben! Minho, who often enjoyed this kind of shot to the level of a trademark during his time at Parma, shows it here!

Hearing the Gunners' cheers for the goal I scored in response to Bruno Campos' pass.

Waaaah!

Minho-o-o-o-o-o!

It had been a while since I took a left-footed curved shot.

Seeing my shot, the guys were making a fuss and were delighted.

Anyway, with this goal, I was gradually closing the gap with Ronaldo, who was leading the league in scoring.

Honestly, I have a keen interest in being the top scorer in the league.

Though there's quite a gap with Ronaldo, who is leading the league in scoring.

It's not an insurmountable level.

After my opening goal, Everton couldn't create proper chances due to their rigid tactics.

Naturally, we dominated the game against such Everton.

Additionally, with Bruno Campos' extra goal, the score quickly extended to 2-0.

Everton’s hope, Calvert Lewin, scored a chasing goal, but my multi-goal at the end of the first half crushed their momentum.

And the second half was essentially my one-man show.

I happily devoured the opportunities Bruno Campos set up.

-Minho! It's a hat-trick! Amazing!

-Four goals in one game! Minho overtakes Ronaldo to claim the top scorer position in the league!

-Incredible! Now we understand why Arsenal put everything on the line to sign this player.

-Remarkable. Despite moving to a different league for the first season, his form hasn’t dropped!

Arsenal secured a 5-1 victory.

As soon as the game ended, the media began praising my scoring ability.

[Minho’s Rampage! Scores 4 goals against Everton!]
[No need for an adaptation period! Minho leads Arsenal to victory with his 16th league goal against Everton!]
[Park Minho overtakes Ronaldo to become the league's top scorer!]

But.

The praises soon faded.

No, I didn’t expect this guy to rejuvenate so suddenly.

[Ronaldo! Explodes with 2 goals against Manchester City!]
[17 League Goals! Ronaldo reclaims the Premier League top scorer position!]
[Cristiano Ronaldo, burning his last flame before retirement! Reminiscent of his Real Madrid days!]
[Messi also records 8 goals and 10 assists in Ligue 1 for PSG! Is the Messi-Ronaldo era far from over?]

No sooner had I become the top scorer with 16 league goals than Ronaldo scored 2 goals against a struggling Manchester City, reclaiming the top scorer title.

Though I usually dislike his behavior, I have to admit he’s impressive in these moments.

But... hearing this provocation makes my contrarian spirit want to leap out of my heart.

[Ronaldo: ‘This season's top scorer is me. Minho? Has he ever won a Ballon d'Or? If not, he’s not my competitor.’]

"Ah... this makes me want to stir things up again."

Thinking of retiring with the top scorer title in honor?

Well, I’m going to snatch that top scorer title from you.
