## 37. North London Derby (1)

Amani Richards realized something while watching Park Minho during the preseason.

Because his talent is extraordinary.

Just as Park Minho said, a little effort would surely yield great results.

Of course, Park Minho never gave such advice, but anyway, Amani thought so.

Unlike the past where he didn't try at all, now he at least pretended to train at the training ground, all thanks to Park Minho's advice.

And as he trained, Amani could feel his skills gradually improving.

Even though he was skimping through the training.

He believed in his own talent.

Of course, compared to that monster Park Minho, his talent was far inferior, but compared to other players, Amani's talent was truly brilliant.

Today, he arrived at the training ground just in the nick of time.

Naturally, even though he was the last to arrive, he was confident.

After all, there were people who arrived later than him, so Amani couldn't help but be confident.

"Pedro is the latest again today."

"That guy is always late."

Listening to the coaches' conversation, Amani slowly started to warm up, looking at Craig Martin from a distance, who had come in early and was diligently training on the basics.

'Fool without any tricks.'

It was problematic because he trained thoughtlessly like that.

Unlike himself, who only needed to polish the lacking parts, that guy was going over the basics again.

That's why his growth was slow.

He couldn't understand Craig Martin.

Of course, this wasn't because he was a forward and Craig was a defender.

Amani Richards couldn't understand why he wasted his efforts without any tricks.

If simply pouring time without any tricks could improve skills, the EPL would be filled with players like Messi, Ronaldo, and Zlatan.

'Of course, I can become greater than those three.'

A hand flew towards the self-praising Amani Richards.

When Amani turned around after getting hit on the back of his head, he saw Park Minho, sweating and having finished warming up.

"Run quickly. Don't slack off here."

"Of course."

I'll run one less lap.

Thinking so, Amani started running around the training ground. And as soon as he started running, he could feel Craig Martin's gaze from afar.

As he was conscious of Craig Martin's gaze, Amani abandoned the thought of running one less lap.

'I should run one more lap than that fool to show the difference in talent.'

Thus, Amani Richards revealed his will by running one more lap than usual.

But he didn't know.

That Craig, who had arrived early, had run much more than he thought to warm up.

* * *

A slippery guy.

Unlike Santiago, this slippery guy was still improving every day despite his lazy training.

That's why it was more regrettable.

At the same time, it was impressive.

As if reading my thoughts, Lorenzo Lupo nodded his head while looking at Amani.

"If I had the same talent as that guy, I would have struggled to challenge the world's best."

Well, this guy has a lot of talent too.

Starting with the fact that a 2-meter giant has good ball control, Lorenzo seemed unaware of the huge advantage he had.

"That's why... talented guys are the problem."

Lorenzo gave me an irreverent look at my words.

No, I'm not that talented, you know?

But Lorenzo's gaze didn't change.

I felt sad because it seemed like he didn't know how much effort I put in since my time in Korea.

No, I want to tell him that I'm not a talent freak but a normal human who shouts 'effort,' but recalling the looks of people who watched me since my time in Parma, I couldn't easily make excuses.

But it's true...

I'm not a talent freak...

I ran really hard, and even in the off-season, I crazily polished my basics...

Anyway.

Recently, as the young guys showed concentration at the training ground, some veterans also raised their tension to keep their starting positions.

Seeing the team atmosphere seemingly set to some extent, our coach smiled contentedly, and we achieved a 3-0 victory against Leicester City in the 7th round of the Premier League.

It was Lorenzo Lupo's hat-trick.

I also recorded a modest assist.

Overall, the team's performance was quite good, and even after the match, the Gooners were very happy.

- Is this really Arsenal? Is this for real?

- That was incredible! It's not the Arsenal that always struggled against Leicester City!

- Damn! Damn! Damn! I didn't buy a season ticket this time... I regret it so much.

- Aaaaah! Arsenal! Mino! I love you all!

- Minoooooooo!

- Mino already has a girlfriend.

The flow was too good.

A continuous streak of victories without any defeats.

Even though I briefly went to Korea due to the international break in mid-October, the good flow continued.

We also won the Europa League Group F 3rd match against AEK Larnaca on October 21st.

And we continued our good mood by winning the 8th round league match against Crystal Palace.

However.

Arsenal's training ground had a serious atmosphere completely different from the good mood.

"Why is everyone so tense?"

When I asked Lorenzo after arriving at the training ground, he smiled and answered.

"It's a derby."

"Oh... a derby."

Honestly, I didn't think derbies were such a big deal, but I realized it when I saw the eyes of those affiliated with Arsenal.

'Oh, this is something serious.'

Such thoughts crossed my mind.

At the same time, I understood when I recalled our next opponent.

Yes, Arsenal's next opponent was Tottenham.

The next match for Arsenal was the 'North London Derby.'

* * *

The last match of October is the North London Derby.

Monica slowly started to gather her will.

What kind of match is the North London Derby to begin with?

For the Gooners, this North London Derby was nothing short of a holy war.

Of course, it was the same for the Spurs, but still.

This North London Derby was held at Arsenal's home, the Emirates Stadium, and Monica was already well-prepared for this match.

She wasn't the only one.

Numerous Gooners and Spurs were grinding their teeth ahead of this North London Derby.

Of course, the police in London were trembling, recalling the last North London Derby of the previous season, but the Gooners and Spurs didn't care.

They just wanted their team to crush the opponent.

[North London Derby is fierce even before the match!]

[Tottenham showing the worst season start vs. Arsenal leading the league from the beginning of the season!]

[The Gooners' mockery pouring on the Spurs!]

[Arsenal's Mino! Can he lead the team to victory in the North London Derby like King Henry?]

[Who will be the winner of the first North London Derby of the 23-24 season?]

[Henry: 'Mino is Arsenal's best signing! He is a fantastic player more than any other Arsenal player.']

[Tottenham Hotspur aiming to turn the team atmosphere around with a victory in the North London Derby!]

[Mino vs. Harriet Kane! The battle of North London aces!]

The media was also fueling the interest in this North London Derby by producing articles about it.

"Alright, the uniform is ready..."

Monica looked at the neatly washed Arsenal uniform with a satisfied smile.

On the back of the Arsenal uniform she had hung up, the number '10' and Park Minho's name were written.

For her, this North London Derby was equivalent to a Korea-Japan match.

No matter what, they had to win against the Spurs, and even if they were relegated, they must be ranked higher than Spurs.

Yes, this is what a derby match was.

Park Minho, who came home from work, sensed Monica's grim determination and realized.

'Ah, if we lose tomorrow's match, I'm really dead.'

Such thoughts came to his mind first.

Of course, various football communities and SNS were also buzzing with the Spurs and Gooners' verbal fights.

- The next match is against the stupid Spurs. We need to show who the real kings of North London are in this match.

- F*** off, you stupid doghouse! Who were the idiots who lost to us last season and couldn't even get into the Champions League?

- Stupid Gooner!

- So, what's the current rank of the Spurs?

- 14th! A rank fitting for stupid idiots.

- Hey! When will you rise to 1st place? Stupid friends!

- Spurs! Spurs! The stupid neighbors of the great Gooners!

- Do you think your rank will last forever? We'll catch up soon! Just wait!

Still, the side that had the upper hand was, of course, the Gooners.

Arsenal was leading the league this season, while Tottenham was off to a poor start at 14th place.

Watching Monica thinking only about the North London Derby until bedtime, Park Minho quietly prayed.

For tomorrow's match.

Hoping he could get through the game unscathed.

* * *

Finally, the day has come.

The morning of the North London Derby between Arsenal and Tottenham was much colder than usual.

The Emirates Stadium was bustling from early on, ready to welcome the unwanted guests.

The Gooners, who had already prepared thoroughly, were waiting for the Spurs who had booked the away seats.

After a little while.

The Spurs who had booked the away seats began to enter under the escort of the Emirates police.

The insults and mockery directed at the Spurs continued.

The Spurs standing behind the police also continued to hurl insults and criticisms at the Gooners.

Monica entered the Emirates Stadium early.

She entered the VIP seats and looked at the Spurs entering the away section from afar.

"Stupid Spurs."

Was there really a reason to come and watch?

Despite knowing that Tottenham would lose, those idiots came to the Emirates Stadium to watch today's match.

Soon, the players of both teams entered the field.

The Gooners in the stands energetically sang Arsenal's anthem, cheering on the Arsenal players entering the field.

Then the game began.

Monica quietly prayed for Arsenal's victory while also hoping that Park Minho could finish the match safely.

The early part of the game was intense.

Fierce physical fights befitting the name of the North London Derby frequently occurred, with the players often clashing.

- It's intense! The early part of the game already shows scenes worthy of the North London Derby.

- A tackle by Vito Kjær, who transferred from AC Milan this season! Gabriel Martinelli is down on the field!

- It's a foul. But no card.

- Tyrone Tierney protests to the referee. He thinks a card should be given for this.

Every time a foul occurred, enormous boos poured onto the field.

When Arsenal fouled, the Spurs in the away section shouted at the top of their lungs, booing loudly.

Conversely, when Tottenham fouled, the Emirates Stadium shook with boos.

In such a situation, in the 13th minute of the first half, a good pass was connected to Park Minho in a good position.

Monica prayed as she watched.

Please score a wonderful goal.

* * *

This is kind of crazy.

Italian ultras seem crazy too.

But the English hooligans are quite mad as well.

A derby is definitely a derby.

I could understand why the players of both teams were rougher and more desperate than usual through the atmosphere of the fans.

The shouts of the Spurs calling to kill us could be heard even through the cheers of the home fans.

"Isn't it a bit rough?"

Today's match.

Kaiky, the Tottenham defender marking me, awkwardly asked.

This simple Brazilian guy, who transferred to Tottenham this season, seemed uncomfortable with this atmosphere.

"Yeah, it's a bit rough."

With my answer, the pass connected.

The moment I grabbed the ball, Kaiky stretched his foot to steal the ball, but I dodged him with a feint and ran forward.

Waaaaaah!

But my breakthrough ended there.

As soon as a rough tackle came in, I rolled on the field.

Of course, I wasn't hurt.

I expected such a tackle to come, so I was prepared to fall.

Booooooo!

Enormous boos poured out.

The Emirates Stadium, known for its quiet atmosphere and nicknamed the Emirates Library, was so noisy that the nickname seemed like a lie during the North London Derby.

Peeeep!

The referee's whistle signaled a foul and a yellow card was shown.

The first yellow card of today's match came out.

Of course, the recipient was Viktor Lundgren, who tackled me roughly.

"Can you get up?"

I took the hand extended by Tyler Smith Rowe and stood up.

It was definitely a rough match.

But it was doable.

Alright, the first chance given to me in today's match.

I really wanted to succeed in this free-kick chance obtained at a fairly close distance.

If there's a reason...

Maybe because of Monica?

In other matches, it didn't matter, but if I didn't score against Tottenham, I felt like Monica would nag me.

So I wanted to score as many goals as possible.

Really a lot.

As much as possible.
