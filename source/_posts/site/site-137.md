## Idol (1)

The changed tactics definitely felt different.

It wasn't a dynamic change.

Even with a similar formation, many parts changed depending on the roles given to the players.

The new tactics prepared by the coach felt like a big advantage to me because it was an asymmetric tactic focused on the right side.

The first advantage was that Tierney and I could push high up like a three-top and penetrate deep into the opponent's territory.

Secondly, the right winger sacrificed defensively, giving me more opportunities to move into the center.

Lastly, it became easier for me to find and exploit empty spaces in the opponent's defense compared to last season.

"It feels like Coach Nigel's 4-3-3 has been arranged in our coach's style."

"It definitely resembles the tactics Munich showed last season. They packed players who could pass, keep, and develop play on the right side and then switched it widely to the left where Minho and Tierney were spread out to create direct chances."

"It doesn't feel bad."

The players who were somewhat knowledgeable about tactics realized where our coach got the inspiration for this strategy.

The feeling of these tactics during training wasn't bad.

The defense also wasn't bad.

Especially, the transition of Fabian, who newly joined the team, to a wing-back was going more smoothly than expected.

However, it was inevitable that the passing ability of the wingers, who were supposed to lead the passes on the right side, was lacking.

Amani and Jules Kambé.

Both players showed stronger performances when dribbling and breaking through with the ball rather than without it.

Of course, I thought Bruno Campos or Ødegaard could sufficiently cover that aspect.

It seemed our coach shared the same thought, so he didn't touch that part much.

"Damn cool."

"Plus, a legendary coach with plenty of hair."

"You really are a tactics god, Alain Levagne!"

I heard our coach muttering to himself.

Our Alain coach, brushing his abundant hair that was different from last season, smiled softly.

Even though he had hair now, he somehow looked sad.

I didn't know why, but I felt sorry for him, thinking that hair might gradually disappear during the season.

Well... Go, coach!

It seemed all I could say was this.

While the world was noisy with player transfers.

The Korean football scene was also noisy with the transfer of several players.

The most notable player was Park Sangbin, who had played with me in the national team, moving to Liverpool.

[Park Sangbin transfers to Liverpool! Transfer fee of 7.8 billion won!]

[Park Sangbin joins Liverpool's training soon after transferring! Can he adapt to Liverpool?]

[Park Sangbin! Will he be a backup for Diogo Jota?]

[Direct transfer from Suwon to Liverpool! What kind of player is Park Sangbin?]

It seemed Liverpool was looking at Park Sangbin as a lottery ticket.

With a transfer fee of 7.8 billion won, it was a very cheap lottery ticket, so it wasn't a problem for the wealthy Liverpool.

As I expected, Liverpool quickly loaned Park Sangbin out after acquiring him.

[Park Sangbin! On a one-year loan to Parma! Can he become the next Park Minho?]

[Parma official: 'We had been watching Park Sangbin! As soon as he transferred to Liverpool, we contacted them and secured a loan immediately.']

[Parma! Continuing love for Korean players! Admitting they are eyeing another Korean player!]

Somehow, when Parma contacted me a few days ago asking, "What do you think of Park Sangbin?" I had a hunch he might go on loan.

I thought it wasn't a bad loan.

At the same time, the love calls from overseas clubs towards Korean players continued.

[Everton! Completes transfer of Lee Junsik from Mallorca!]

[Lee Juho! Transfers to PSG! Expected to be backup for Famel Bragança!]

[Korean players' overseas transfer rush! European clubs continuously watch Korea to find the next Park Minho!]

[Arsenal! Establishes East Asian youth center in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi-do!]

[Man Utd! Confirms Korea tour this preseason!]

There's something like that.

When a player from a country performs sensationally, clubs often show interest in players from the same country.

Of course, I knew well that not many Korean players would survive in this recent entry.

Still, just being part of such big clubs would not negatively affect their value or future careers, so I didn't view their challenges entirely negatively.

"Minho, should we also sign a Korean player?"

I shook my head firmly at the coach's question.

Honestly, the current Arsenal squad was complete.

Adding more wouldn't change much.

Although we might not show overwhelming performance like last season, the current Arsenal was definitely one of the title contenders.

"Saving up money and bringing in Mbappe would be more helpful for Arsenal, coach."

The coach nodded at my joke.

But... why did he look so serious?

No way, would Mbappe come to Arsenal?

"That's like Lewandowski going to Barcelona."

Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

* * *

Arsenal started their preseason in London and left for training in the U.S. a week later.

The first friendly match was against 'New York City FC,' a club founded through a partnership between Manchester City and the New York Yankees.

I heard they also scheduled friendly matches with New York Cosmos and New York Red Bulls in New York.

Despite the upcoming match, the players were staring at their smartphones, chatting about something.

"What are you talking about so much?"

"Ah! Minho. We were talking about Olympic soccer."

"Oh... the Olympics!"

In fact, I had the opportunity to participate as a wildcard in the 2024 Paris Olympics but firmly declined and did not participate.

Initially, the military wasn't an issue for me.

The current U-23 team had more significant defensive problems than offensive ones, so I gave up my wildcard spot to another player.

Well, if they win a gold medal at the Olympics... it could assure me this year's Ballon d'Or, but for me, winning the Champions League was more important than the Ballon d'Or, so I gave it up.

Some media criticized me as selfish, but honestly, the U-23 team participating in this Paris Olympics was the worst generation ever, so it wasn't a big controversy.

"Oh! It's starting."

I started on the bench for the first friendly match of the training camp.

The opponents, New York City players, ran hard on the field, pressing Arsenal players.

"Their organization is better than I thought?"

"They're a good team."

"Oh! They're on the counterattack."

Their performance was better than expected.

Arsenal's 1.5 team occasionally showed dangerous moments from New York City's counterattacks in the first half.

"They prepared solidly too."

"Wow... that counterattack is sharp."

"What's that guy's name?"

"Felix Magno?"

"Ah, the guy called the second Neymar?"

Brazilian winger Felix Magno, who had been making a mark since 2021, easily broke through Arsenal's defense to create opportunities.

His movements in the counterattack were indeed flashy enough to remind one of Neymar.

But Arsenal wasn't going to be easily beaten.

Arsenal lightly cut the ball and started a counterattack.

Even though he was playing as a full-back, Fabian, who wasn't awkward, made precise passes, becoming the starting point of Arsenal's attack.

"Nice!"

"Wow! His accuracy is higher than I thought?"

"His long-pass ability is quite something."

The pass connected from Fabian Pavone's foot landed precisely at the feet of Amani Richards running down the right flank.

As soon as his foot touched the ball, Amani made a run, penetrating the side of New York City.

Amani, who had grown more after the pain of defeat in the recent Euros, showed sharper and more aggressive breakthroughs than last season.

Tap!

And a pass leading to the center.

Amani's pass, perfectly connecting to an open space, was cleanly finished by Lorenzo.

Thud!

A clean goal.

Unlike last season, more direct passes were being made, making the game refreshing.

It didn't feel bad.

Fabian Pavone, with higher pass accuracy than Kamiayas, was clearly fulfilling the role of the starting point of attack on the right side, so there was no frustration in the attack.

The defense wasn't lacking either.

Although not as solid as Kamiayas, at least he showed better defensive capabilities than full-back Kasper Nielsen, who never came back down once he went up.

Our coach also nodded with a satisfied look.

In the subsequent game, Arsenal drew New York City's attention by exchanging passes on the right side.

Arsenal held the ball until the full-back and wing-forward, who went high up on the opposite side, occupied wide spaces, then quickly switched the ball to the opposite side as soon as an opportunity arose.

And the two players who occupied wide spaces on the opposite side happily took shots from the left side of New York City, threatening their goal.

Thud!

"Nice!"

"Another one here!"

Kasper Nielsen, who played as the left-back in today's game, scored the second goal, showing a good performance.

At the same time, the first half ended, and the coach made a large number of substitutions, including the players resting on the bench for the second half.

"That player... Minho!"

"Can I stop Minho?"

"I should get his autograph after the game."

As soon as I stepped onto the field, the New York City players started whispering among themselves.

Especially Felix Magno, the ace of New York City, openly stared at me with sparkling eyes.

He seemed to feel a sense of competitiveness.

"Minho!"

As soon as I entered the field for the second half, a good opportunity came to me.

As New York City players crowded to the opposite side, Ødegaard's sharp pass connected precisely to my feet.

The space in front of me was wide open.

It was very leisurely to run at speed.

Tap!

As soon as I kicked the ball long and started running, New York City's defenders rushed at me.

"Stop him! Stop him!"

I moved quickly, brushing past the desperate shouts of the defenders.

I followed the flashy movements shown by Felix Magno, the opposing ace, in the first half.

As the flustered New York City defender's feet tangled, he slipped on the field, and I lightly stepped over another defender attempting to pressure me.

After swiftly passing two players.

I took a shot half a beat faster, so the goalkeeper, shouting at the defenders, couldn't react.

Thud!

The net shook violently.

The New York City goalkeeper sat down, looking dazed at the net-shaking ball.

"Niceeeee!"

"This season feels good too?"

"Minoooooooo!"

"As expected! It's Mino!"

As soon as I scored, my teammates ran over to praise my goal.

On my way back to my position.

Felix Magno, who had shown flashy dribbling in the first half and perfectly replicated my movements, was staring at me with even more sparkling eyes.

"What's this."

Is he gay?
