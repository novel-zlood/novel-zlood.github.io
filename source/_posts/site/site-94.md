## 35. Monica's Happiness Arsenal (2)

Certainly, Liverpool is a strong team.

How did I feel it?

The number of times I entered the opponent's danger zone was cut in half compared to other matches.

The fortunate thing is that Liverpool's defensive line and midfield line were a bit loose.

Surprisingly, there was space between the two lines in today's match, allowing us to create good scenes.

Thanks to that, I scored a beautiful equalizer.

I ran toward Monica and excitedly patted the Arsenal emblem.

Probably, the chance to score so easily against Liverpool will only come in the early season.

Despite the experienced line coordination of Jonathan Henderson and Kyle Van Dijk, Liverpool kept shaking.

Of course, it wasn't easy for Arsenal either.

It felt like both teams' organization wasn't great.

Maybe because both teams included rotation members, it was a bit sloppy.

How well we recover from mistakes seemed to be the most crucial point of today's match.

-Salaaahhhhh!

-As expected, it's Salah for Liverpool! Salah's multi-goal! Liverpool takes the lead again with 2-1!

-Amazing! Salah!

Salah, who missed out on the Ballon d'Or last season to Mbappe, scored again.

Honestly, this year's Ballon d'Or might go to that guy because Liverpool won the Champions League.

Certainly, Salah matched his reputation and extended the score difference to 2-1 again.

Well, there's no time to be disappointed, right?

If we lose a point, we just need to make it again.

We need to work harder to equalize.

In that sense, a friend who was running like crazy today caught my eye.

"Mino!"

Bernard Partey.

His pass landed perfectly on my foot.

He didn't seem like a friend with such good skills originally, but in today's match, it felt like he had an epiphany or something.

I heard he was evaluated as an almost all-around hexagonal midfielder at Atletico Madrid.

Today might be the match where Bernard Partey regains his past form.

Tap!

As the ball accurately connected to my foot running up the side, Liverpool's most cautious player blocked my path.

-Douglas Alexander Arnold! Blocks Mino!

-Mino dribbles up slowly!

-Arnold is watching Mino's foot.

He's really an excellent player.

In modern football, where fullbacks are increasingly given important roles, I think Liverpool can challenge for the title every season thanks to their solid fullbacks compared to other teams.

Well, although he's a player who usually goes up offensively, in today's match, he was defending to block me.

Thanks to that, I couldn't shake things up freely from the side, but I didn't see it as a big problem.

Eventually, I can break through and score.

But this time, I thought I had to be the bait.

The marking on me was tighter than I thought.

-Mino! Tries to break through but turns back and crosses with an outside foot!

-A perfectly curved cross!

-Gabriel! Gabriel's header!

-Stephan Bürki's save! Ah! The punched ball is shot again by Gabriel! Gabriel! Shoots again! Goal! Gooooooal!

After several shots and saves involving both teams' players, Gabriel Martinelli succeeded in scoring with the cross I sent, and the score returned to a 2-2 tie.

"Nice cross!"

"I thought he wouldn't score, it was nerve-wracking."

"Great! Let's go for the lead again!"

We lightly shared our joy with the players.

Arsenal caught up to a tie again.

But the time given to us in the first half was just up to here.

* * *

In the second half, the fierce match between Arsenal and Liverpool continued.

The score remained at 2-2, and both teams' ace players, Park Minho and Salah, were silent in the second half.

Manager Jürgen Klopp substituted Rupert Jones and Christophe Lazaro, who was signed from Inter this summer, aiming to balance offense and defense and find opportunities.

Arsenal took a more offensive approach.

They substituted Lorenzo Rupo and Pedro Ocampos, showing that they weren't satisfied with a 2-2 draw.

It was a natural choice.

This was Arsenal's home, Emirates Stadium.

Wanting 3 points at home was obvious.

And at the 31st minute of the second half.

A scene changed the atmosphere of both teams.

Park Minho, who caught the ball, swiftly passed Liverpool's Arnold for the first time today and penetrated the danger zone.

Arnold, looking urgent, fouled to stop him.

Arsenal got a free-kick chance from a good position.

Naturally, the kicker was Park Minho.

Though the angle was a bit tricky, the distance was short enough to aim directly.

And just like Arsenal fans prayed, Park Minho showed a perfect free-kick, filling Emirates Stadium with cheers.

-Gooooooal!

-Mino achieves a multi-goal against Liverpool! It was a near-perfect free-kick!

-Stephan Bürki couldn't block it as it curved perfectly into the net!

-The score is now 3-2! Liverpool finally allows Arsenal to take the lead!

Even though the league changed.

Park Minho's performance was no different from Serie A.

Watching Park Minho's consistent performance, Gooners sang cheers filled with joy.

Having allowed the lead, Liverpool fiercely troubled Arsenal in the remaining time.

To protect the one-point lead, Arsenal threw their bodies on the line, resembling a close combat defense.

Finally, the second half ended.

The extra time also passed, making the home fans at Emirates Stadium's hearts race.

And then.

When even the extra time was fully used.

The referee blew the whistle, signaling the end of the match.

Arsenal won against Liverpool for the first time in two years.

Seeing this, Gooners cheered loudly with joy.

Waaaaaaaah!

After a narrow 3-2 victory, Coach Alain Levagne shook hands with Coach Jürgen Klopp and then quickly ran and hugged Park Minho tightly.

“Hahahaha! Mino! You're the best!”

In today's match.

Coach Alain couldn't help but be delighted seeing Park Minho involved in all the goals.

The fans felt the same.

Gooners changed the cheer song that was sung for Park Minho at Parma to suit Arsenal, celebrating his multi-goal.

Naturally, as soon as the match ended, Arsenal's victory news spread through the media.

[Arsenal! 3-2 Comeback Win! Beating Liverpool for the First Time in 2 Years!]

[No Issues with Adaptation! Mino! Leading the Team to Victory with Multi-Goals!]

[Stronger Than Expected Arsenal! Could They Win the League This Season?]

[A Tense 3-2 Thriller! A Guaranteed Entertaining Match by Both Teams!]

[Mino vs Salah! The Winner of This Season's Ballon d'Or Match is Mino by Decision!]

-Minoooooooo!

-Does the forward score goals? Does the midfielder pass? Does the defender defend? Does the goalkeeper save?

-Was Arsenal always this strong? The gameplay was better than I thought, so I'm a bit surprised.

-Adding Mino definitely changes the offensive power.

-Yeah……. He's the highest-paid player in the club, and he's proving his worth. The satisfaction is incredible!

-How did Arsenal become a strong team?

-Stop with the jinx! Stop with the jinx!

-Haha, voodoo on!

-That guy's a jinx. Definitely a jinx.

-Arsenal is not a strong team! Arsenal is not a strong team! Arsenal is not a strong team!

-I’m cracking up at the fans immediately crouching after putting up the flag, haha.

Early in the season.

Many Gooners couldn't adapt to Arsenal leading unexpectedly.

Still, most Gooners enjoyed Arsenal briefly rising to the top of the league with two consecutive wins at the start of the season.

Because they knew better than anyone that they would eventually come down from that position.

But.

Arsenal's winning streak did not break.

-Goooooooal!

-A wonder goal by Pedro Ocampos against Norwich in the 44th minute of the second half! A fantastic goal!

-Pedro cleanly finished the pass from Mino! He ends the match!

In the third round of the league.

Arsenal secured a 1-0 victory against Norwich and showed fierce form in the fourth round match against Aston Villa, which came after the international break.

Even Aston Villa, who recently showed good performance, couldn't stop Arsenal, who was gaining momentum.

-Minooooooo!

-Mino scores his 4th league goal! He shows his skills against Aston Villa as well!

-Amazing!

Gooners felt a sense of happiness, watching Park Minho lead the team's winning streak with 4 goals and 2 assists in 4 league matches.

It was a dominant performance they hadn't felt in a long time.

Winning against Big 6 teams like Man U and Liverpool, and not losing to weaker teams like a goblin team, Arsenal's form was something not seen in a long time.

Naturally, Monica also stayed happy during her stay in London, smiling.

It was a 4-game winning streak in the league.

Monica was always surprised that she didn't feel any stress from supporting Arsenal these days.

She also felt anxious.

[No Problem for Mino in Premier League! Big Clubs' Interest Towards Him!]

[Real Madrid Still Haven’t Given Up on the Mbappe-Haaland-Mino Super Galacticos!]

[Mino Proves Consistency Even as a Wing Forward!]

Would he suddenly leave Arsenal?

Monica's eyes were filled with worry.

So, today as well, Monica quietly sat in front of the computer to protect Park Minho.

[Comment Section]

-ManUtheBest: If only Mino comes, Man U can rise.

-MinoArsenalForever: Nope, not happening.

-BestManCity: Mino's price seems cheaper than I thought?

-MinoArsenalForever: Nope, even for 300 million euros, we won't sell.

-GoGoEverton: What's with that Gooner?

-ManUtheBest: It's a Mino fan that recently appeared.

-BestManCity: It's an attention-seeker who shows up like a ghost whenever Mino is mentioned, leaves nasty comments, and runs away.

-FoxesSquad: Geez……. A guy with nothing better to do.

-MinoArsenalForever: Nope, Mino stays at Arsenal forever.

The worst attention-seeker in the Premier League community.

The birth of ‘MinoArsenalForever’ came from Park Minho's transfer to Arsenal.

Of course, Park Minho didn't know that.

Maybe he would never know.

Because Monica was more meticulous than anyone else.

* * *

During the international break.

South Korea's first match in the second round of the 2026 North and Central America World Cup Asia qualifiers was against 'Guam.'

A considerably weak team.

Honestly, it was a match South Korea could never lose, so most of the starters began on the bench.

Even in such a situation, South Korea won against Guam with a tremendous score difference of 16-0.

Well, the opponent was such an overwhelming underdog that such a score difference could come out.

It was a rare match where all four of South Korea's attackers recorded hat-tricks, and after that, the next opponent was Taiwan, which they easily defeated 5-0, finishing the international break cleanly.

Well, after returning, they lightly won against Norwich and Aston Villa, continuing the good momentum.

Honestly, I didn't find it particularly fun.

How tight the marking was……. As soon as I got the ball, they grabbed my jersey first, making it tough.

Of course, I kept accumulating attack points.

Anyway.

Arsenal was quite good in the league.

And to carry that momentum into the Europa League, we sweated hard in training.

Ah! Arsenal was placed in Group F with ‘Lazio’, ‘Basel’, and ‘AEK Larnaca’.

Well, except for Lazio, the other teams were manageable, according to the experts.

[Can Arsenal Win Their First Europa League Group Stage Match Against Lazio?]

[Serie A Killer Mino! Zeroing in on Lazio!]

[Mino Has Good Memories Against Lazio!]

Of course, I also thought Lazio was manageable.

Since I always had good memories against Serie A teams, this time wouldn't be different.
