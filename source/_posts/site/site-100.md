## 37. North London Derby (3)

Tottenham caught up with a score of 2-1.

After scoring a goal, they became even more aggressive in their attacks, more so than in the first half.

Honestly, that goal was practically a one-man show by Harriet Kane.

After that goal, Tottenham had three more chances, but due to inaccurate passes, they couldn't connect the ball to their main striker, Harriet Kane.

Honestly, if we had conceded one more goal, it would have been a real problem.

Watching that, I realized something.

- As long as we block Harriet Kane well, we won't concede any more goals from Tottenham.

That was my thought.

Now that we've conceded a goal.

Isn't it time for us to score one?

"Don't you think so?"

"What kind of nonsense is that?"

To my question, Tottenham's defender, Viggo Kjaer, looked at me as if I were a strange person.

This guy had a hard time with me back when he was at AC Milan, so he's particularly on edge.

"We're by far the greatest team the world has ever seen!"

"And it's Arsenal, Arsenal FC!"

The Arsenal fans' chants echoed loudly.

The Gunners' voices were filled with a fervent wish to definitely defeat Tottenham.

The Gunners were trembling with anxiety.

They were worried that we might get reversed.

Even though Arsenal is having a great season, they had many come-from-behind losses like this last season.

I could understand their anxiety.

So, I have to show them.

To the Gunners who are trembling with anxiety, thinking 'maybe?' just because we conceded a single goal, who I am.

Because I'm on the field.

There's no need to worry.

- The home fans at the Emirates Stadium are cheering loudly... Oh? Oh! Minho! Minho!

- Minho! He's running with the ball! He's fast!

Bruno Campos intercepted a pass from the opponent and quickly passed it to me.

Thud!

Receiving Bruno's pass at the halfway line, I sprinted forward.

This was the start of a counterattack.

Hoiberg, positioned in the center, urgently ran towards me to take the ball.

Crash!

Hoiberg's aggressive physical play.

I momentarily lost control of the ball.

But I pushed Hoiberg away, chesting the high-floating ball in the process and surged forward.

- Minho! He dribbles past Hoiberg!

- Just like a tank! He pushes through powerfully!

I saw Tottenham's players hastily reorganizing their lines due to my sudden breakthrough.

Tottenham's players looked flustered by my unexpected dribble, and I saw Tyler Smith-Rowe raising his hand while charging down the left flank.

I passed the ball to the open Tyler and called out to him as I ran past Davies Seibalt, who was trying to block me.

"Tyler!"

As if he read my mind.

Tyler Smith-Rowe dribbled forward and then sent a slightly high pass back to me.

I controlled the ball with my chest and pushed into the opponent's danger zone, looking for a chance.

- Minho! He's in a position to shoot!

- That spot! It's Minho's favorite 'Minho zone,' isn't it? Tottenham's defender Emerson is rushing towards him!

- Ah! Minhooooo! A fantastic step-over! Emerson is left looking foolish!

With a light step-over, I got past Emerson and assessed my position, realizing it was a bit awkward.

Just as I thought it would be nice to have a bit more space, I saw Kasper Nielsen overlapping from behind.

- Kasper Nielsen overlaps! Minho passes the ball shortly to him, and he runs down the flank!

- He's in a position to cross!

- Kasper Nielsen's cross!

- Minho's headerrrrr!

- GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL! Minhooooo! He extends the lead to 3-1 with a multi-goal!

- Incredible! Minho! Minho!

Swoosh!

As soon as I scored, I slid in front of the fans, patting the emblem.

Why fear a comeback loss when I'm on the field?

With that message, I kept patting Arsenal's emblem, and the fans chanted my name.

Minhooooooo!

We love you, Minhoooo!

Wow! You're the best! Minho! Minho!

Exactly.

This is why I score goals.

I raised my finger as if taking a photo of this moment, and the fans' cheers grew louder with some cursing mixed in.

After enjoying the fans' cheers a bit more, I got up and returned to my position.

Seeing me, Harriet Kane looked at me with slightly angry eyes.

Why is that?

Did I do something wrong?

No matter how much I think, I can't figure it out.

* * *

Screeeeech!

Monica let out a scream.

A scream of joy, that is.

- Minho provocatively celebrates!

- After scoring against Tottenham, he performs Shin Junseo's camera celebration in front of the Arsenal fans!

- Ah! Harriet Kane looks a bit angry! He's having a verbal spat with Arsenal's Ricardo Magalh√£es!

- As expected, it's the North London Derby! The tension between the two teams is palpable here too!

Arsenal fans felt both joy and exhilaration watching Park Minho's goal and celebration.

Of course, Tottenham fans hurled curses and threw objects, causing the game to be stopped for about a minute.

Only then did Park Minho realize.

That celebration could be seen as provocative.

Of course, that was the end of his reflection.

"If you're upset, you should score and do a Henry celebration yourselves!"

Saying this, Tottenham's midfielder Davies Seibalt glared at Park Minho with a furious expression.

Of course, Tottenham couldn't score.

Whether it was due to getting caught up in the increasingly intense game, they kept interrupting the flow with rough fouls.

Tottenham's manager George Martinez shouted at his players to calm down, but Tottenham players, already provoked by Park Minho, couldn't calm down.

- That's already the sixth yellow card in today's game!

- Tottenham! We're already past the 30-minute mark of the second half! If they want to catch up with a two-goal difference, they need to get a grip!

And with Arsenal's fourth goal in the 41st minute of the second half, the game was effectively over.

Park Minho's shooting at half a beat faster hit Victor Lundgren's thigh and deflected into the goal net.

Everyone thought it was a hat-trick.

But the result was an own goal.

The Gunners sighed in disappointment.

As the second half was almost over, Park Minho was eventually substituted and went to the bench, and this North London Derby ended with Arsenal's 4-1 victory.

* * *

[A near-perfect match! The winner of this season's first North London Derby is Arsenal!]

[A rough game with 7 yellow cards in one match! It was indeed the North London Derby!]

[Park Minho scores 2 goals and provides 1 assist! Named Man of the Match!]

[What a pity! Minho could have gotten a hat-trick! The last goal was recorded as an own goal!]

[Arsenal continues their title challenge! Tottenham drops to 16th place in the league with this defeat!]

["16! 16! 16! 16!" Gunners mock the departing Tottenham bus without throwing objects!]

[South Korea's monster Minho! 14 goals and 8 assists this season! The first player in the Premier League to achieve 20 attacking points this season!]

[Park Minho: 'Arsenal is a strong team. We can keep winning. We will definitely lift a trophy this season.']

- Minhooooooo!

- This is it! Now I understand why other big clubs spend so much money!

- Unlike stingy Levy! Our Jade Kroenke is not a miser like him!

- Stan Kroenke?

- Tell that X to get lost.

- Stan should hand over everything to Jade quickly and retire. Only then can Arsenal progress further.

After the game, many Gunners were overjoyed.

They praised Jade Kroenke, who had invested money efficiently this season.

- Damn! Minho's merchandise is sold out! I'll pay four times the price! Anyone willing to sell?

- Sorry, but I won't sell even for ten times the price.

And some praised Park Minho.

Thanks to that, Park Minho's merchandise was sold out.

- Stupid Spurs! 16th in the league? Those idiots don't know how to spend money.

- Do you know? Tottenham's Juan Mario is worth twice as much as Minho?

- How is that possible?

- You can buy two Minhos for one Juan Mario? How can a player like that be more expensive than Minho?

- Stupid Spurs. Did they get ripped off too? Truly pathetic.

Conversely, Tottenham was mocked and ridiculed by the Gunners to the point where some Spurs fans were grinding their teeth, vowing to be careful in the next Tottenham trip.

Anyhow.

After finishing the North London Derby, Park Minho went home.

Monica, a hardcore Gunner, had prepared an event for Park Minho, and as he stepped into the house, he saw Monica in a peculiar outfit and swallowed hard.

Something didn't feel right.

Thinking that, Park Minho stepped into the entrance.

* * *

[EPL October Player of the Month goes to Man United's Cristiano Ronaldo!]

[Ronaldo scores 5 goals and 1 assist in 4 matches, beating Park Minho for the Player of the Month award!]

It seems the old man of Man United has rejuvenated.

Since the beginning of this season, he's been displaying monstrous goal-scoring prowess reminiscent of his days at Real Madrid.

The same goes for Messi in France.

Watching the incredible performances of these two players, I felt that the era of Messi and Ronaldo was coming to an end.

Like Michael Jordan's documentary "The Last Dance" on some OTT service, it seemed like these two were burning their twilight years.

Anyway.

The slightly chilly October has passed.

Finally, it was November, the entrance to winter.

In London, occasional cold snaps hinted at the approaching winter, and perhaps due to this sudden cold, some players started to struggle with injuries.

[Marco Torreira! Out for 4 weeks with an ankle sprain!]

[Arsenal in crisis! Team's core Bernard Partey out for about 2 weeks with a hamstring injury!]

In the League Cup 4th round match against West Ham, two players were injured and fell.

With captain Tyrone Tierney also expected to be out for about 5 weeks from the match against Tottenham, the string of injuries had the Gunners deeply worried.

- It feels like last season...

- Why? Why? Why? Why? When things are going well, why suddenly?

- Please, Minho mustn't get injured! No matter what, Minho absolutely mustn't get injured!

Anyway.

Our next opponent is Brighton.

And Brighton's manager is someone we know well.

A manager who achieved results at Aston Villa, a legendary Liverpool player, and known to us by the nickname "Humba Humba," manager Steven Gerrard.

His Brighton is our next opponent.
