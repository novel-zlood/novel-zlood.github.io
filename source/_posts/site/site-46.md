## 17. Professor Park Minho! (5)

Germany is strong.

Just from what they showed in the first half, I could see how they made numerous names for themselves in the history of football.

Coach Pedro praised the 2-1 score at the end of the first half and demanded more focus in the second half.

We all know that a 2-1 scoreline is never a comfortable margin in football.

But.

We are leading by one point.

And we know how to use this to pressure the opponent.

"In the second half, we'll drop back to the second line and continue our defense differently from the first half."

"After switching both wingers, we'll try to counter-attack using the flanks."

It seemed like Coach Pedro was planning to preserve our energy as much as possible and then use our substitutes to match Germany's strong flanks in the second half.

"It will be a tough second half."

"Even Minho, who develops the ball, will find it difficult to protect or carry the ball."

"But if we hold on, opportunities will come our way."

With those final words, halftime ended.

I felt like more explanation was needed here and there.

But the coach didn't open his mouth anymore.

Well, to explain it roughly,

Just drop back and defend a bit, and when Germany gets tired, use our fresh flanks to counter-attack.

That was Coach Pedro's plan for the second half.

But I feel a bit uneasy.

Would a team like Germany easily allow us to park the bus?

Honestly, I don't think so.

Germany is Germany.

Even though we scored two goals against them.

The opponent will undoubtedly come at us fiercely in the second half.

We also need to attack.

You remember what Coach Bonfrere used to say, right?

If they score two goals, we score three.

If they score three, we score four.

I think we need to do the same.

But it seemed Coach Pedro thought otherwise.

The consequence of his wrong decision was indeed painful.

-Goooooal!

-Oh! Germany scores an equalizer just 2 minutes into the second half, making it 2-2!

-A goal scored in a flash! A mistake caused by miscommunication in the defense turned out to be fatal!

A mistake made right at the start of the second half.

We quickly lost the ball in a dangerous area.

The ball that was intercepted was perfectly passed to Theo Werner, who was moving along the flank by Tommy Kroos.

Theo Werner broke through fiercely.

Korea allowed the breakthrough and the goal.

"Tsk..."

I told you we should attack aggressively.

Even Coach Pedro was shocked, watching our defense get pierced so easily.

There's no choice.

Even if we want to change tactics now,

If we suddenly go on the offensive against a team that's already on a roll, we'll just get beaten up.

How do I know?

Most teams that faced Parma crumbled this way.

They drop back but still get penetrated, so they quickly change tactics.

Then they'd concede 3-4 goals, and the score would widen to 6-2, 7-1.

We could fall into the same situation now.

So, we must focus on defending quietly.

Everyone except senior Shin Junseo drops back.

Yes, if we hold on, opportunities will come.

As soon as the ball went out, Coach Pedro started substituting several players.

Hwang Yoohyun, Jung Yoohyuk, Kim Youngsoo.

Three players went out.

Lim Joosung, Kang Joosung, Lee Joohyun.

Three players came in.

"4-4-2!"

"Minho! Go up with Joosung as a two-top!"

"Two-top?"

"Yes! Everyone else will drop back except for Joosung."

I roughly understood what he meant.

Everyone except for Lim Joosung, who is good at post-play, and me, who is in a good position to receive the ball, went into defense.

The coach seemed to be thinking about counter-attacks while focusing on defense.

And he was also planning to test a new defender this time.

Yes, if we hold on, good opportunities might arise.

When Germany shows a gap, I can rush in and create a crack.

Alright.

It's not impossible.

Fortunately, Germany soon showed a gap.

A tempting prey came into my sight.

-Kenny Havertz out, Stefan Gundogan in!

-A somewhat unexpected substitution, but it seems Germany is also taking a breather.

Stefan Gundogan, who stands at the third line.

He has also played at the second line, so he can show good performance in attacking parts, but

He doesn't overlap much.

The reason being... he's slow.

And a slow opponent is a feast for fast players like senior Shin Junseo or me.

Well, the opponent is full of energy.

If I can't beat such a slow opponent...

I don't deserve to be called a 'crack.'

* * *

The moment it became 2-2.

Germany's offensive became stronger.

Stefan Gundogan was added to strengthen the midfield.

Gundogan generally protects the ball at the third line.

He takes on the role of distributing the ball to the front.

If necessary, he rises to an attacking position and takes active shots.

At Manchester City, he showed decent performances with such attacking moves, accumulating quite a few attacking points.

But not in the German national team.

In the national team, Stefan Gundogan is more of a balanced midfielder.

Except for being slow, he has a well-rounded skillset.

But don't mistake my description of him as a well-rounded player for an average one.

-Stefan's pass!

-Cleanly connected to the front! It's a crisis!

-A direct shot!

-Blocked by Lee Minjoon who throws his body!

What I mean is, he looks average to me.

But not to others.

What? Too arrogant?

They don't seem to think so.

-The ball is connected to Minho Park!

-Tommy, Stefan Gundogan, and Jens Weigl close in on him instantly!

-Minho Park quickly shifts the ball to the flank!

-Germany is marking Minho Park tightly!

Whenever I get the ball, at least two players come at me.

Honestly, I didn't ask for this kind of attention.

-Minho Park! Returns the ball!

-Keeps pushing forward! Korea is finally on a counter-attack! But they don't have many attackers!

Germany's defense thickens quickly.

There's no choice.

We can't all join the attack from a dropped-back position.

Instead of dragging time like this, it's better to take on the challenge.

Yes, like this.

-Minho Park! Minho Park! He dodged them!

-Wow! This is incredible!

I dodged Stefan Gundogan with a Hocus Pocus move and went deeper.

Oh, what's Hocus Pocus, you ask?

Hmm... To put it simply, it's a trick where you do a flip-flap with the kicking foot from a rabona kick position.

It's quite difficult.

But it's incredibly flashy.

You pull the ball out with your legs crossed.

Sometimes, if you nutmeg the opponent, you can even attack their mental state. It's a high-difficulty skill.

Neymar uses it occasionally.

The '77th' star Salvador Sanchez used to show it often during his prime.

Tuk! Tuk!

When I showed it myself, Stefan Gundogan seemed to be thrilled to death.

He pulled on my uniform.

Even if you pull like that, I won't give you an autograph.

Beep!

-Oh! A foul in a good position!

-Stefan Gundogan couldn't keep up with Minho Park's speed and eventually fouled him!

-A free kick in a good position!

"Phew..."

I lay down for a moment and then got up.

Senior Shin Junseo helped me up.

"You're going to take it, right?"

"Can I take it?"

"I think it's better for you to take it from this spot."

"Hmm..."

Senior Shin Junseo should be good with his left foot, but seeing him yield to me, there must be a reason.

Well, I'll know when I do it.

The distance feels a bit far.

I could go for a direct shot.

Or I could lift it appropriately.

Lim Joosung is good at post-play as a forward.

And he doesn't seem to be physically overpowered by the German defenders.

But.

This position feels familiar.

Where have I seen this before?

Ah! I remember Roberto Carlos's UFO free kick was from a similar angle.

Should I give it a try?

But this UFO free kick requires tremendous kicking power.

Even Roberto Carlos explained it as a mistake, scientifically explained as a Magnus effect shot.

While top-level players usually have a shooting speed of around 120 km/h, Roberto Carlos's shots were said to reach around 140 km/h.

I've heard his highest record was 150 km/h... which seems almost impossible.

"Should I really try it?"

I feel like I'll be exhausted after this.

I am fast and have good kicking power.

But I'm not as good as Roberto Carlos.

And I can't guarantee success.

Even Roberto Carlos said it was a mistake... If it were easy to replicate, you'd be a football god, wouldn't you?

Ah, but the angel in my head says.

Just go for it.

"Minho, what are you doing?"

"Oh, I was just checking the angle."

"Are you going for a direct shot?"

"Um... I'll try."

Senior Shin Junseo nodded at my words.

Beep!

The referee blew the whistle.

I made up my mind and took a deep breath.

Let's replicate Roberto Carlos's mistake.

With that mindset, I slowly raised my hand and quickly ran towards the ball.

Bang!

The ball hit with my left foot's out-front curved greatly, going away from the German defenders.

Everyone's eyes were fixed on the ball's trajectory.

It went far off, making it seem like a miss.

Then suddenly, the ball started curving towards the goal.

And then, the sound.

Thud!

Seeing the ball sucked into the goal with goalkeeper Kamiel unable to react, I clenched my fist slightly.

"Yes! That's it!"

At the same time, the Korean players rushed towards me.

"You crazy guy!"

"Wowwwww!"

"This is insane! Insane!"

"Hahaha!"

"It's 3-2 again! 3-2!"

In an instant, I became the bottom bun of the hamburger and kissed the grass.

Ah, I must eat a hamburger after the season ends.

No, I must eat two.

[Title: Professor Park's UFO Free Kick Lecture]

<Content>

-Scene of scoring with a left-foot out-front free kick.

-Scene of Professor Park grinning and clenching his fist.

[Comments]

-Wowwwwww, what?

-Professor! You're moving too fast!

-Wow... amazing.

-Did Minho Park always have such good kicking power?

-It's almost a carbon copy?

-Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho!

Excited football communities in Korea.

That's how impressive Park Minho's performance was.

But it wasn't over yet.

Despite Germany's relentless attacks, Minho Park participated in all the counter-attacks, leading the offense.

-Oh no... Joosung!

-He's missed again!

-Haha, everyone except Shin Junseo should lie down and wait in the locker room.

Clearly, Germany had the upper hand in the game.

But strangely, they were struggling against Korea.

Coach Florian frowned.

'Was this game supposed to turn out this way?'

No.

It shouldn't have turned out like this.

But because of one player, it did.

The score is 3-2, still a one-point difference.

Germany clearly holds the upper hand.

But strangely, it's frustrating.

Half of the second half has already passed.

"Mario!"

Substituting Martin Adeyemi for Mario Gnabry to strengthen the attack, Coach Florian.

Then, substituting Wolf Max and Detlef Rüdiger to strengthen the defense.

And at the 33rd minute of the second half, the equalizing goal finally came.

"Yes!"

The score was tied again at 3-3.

"One more goal! Keep pressing!"

A game that no one expected.

Despite scoring three goals, being tied made Coach Florian more anxious than usual.

At his command, Germany went more aggressive.

But in the 41st minute of the second half, when the ball reached a certain player, Coach Florian realized his mistake.

"Ah!"

In the final minutes of the second half, when the players' stamina was low,

Raising the line high,

He realized that the player who had been tormenting Germany all game had found a perfect opportunity.

* * *

I was left alone at the front.

Senior Shin Junseo also got substituted, and everyone except me was in defense.

Germany, in their haste, raised their line high.

Even goalkeeper Kamiel Neuer showed moments of carrying the ball high up.

I was sticking close to Virde Zule.

As Germany's relentless attack was cut off by Lee Minjoon's tackle,

I slowly moved diagonally, watching for an opportunity.

Ready to run if the ball was cleared long.

-Mario Gnabry shoooots!

-Oh! Jung Seunghwan blocks it with his body!

-Back to Theo Werner! But Lee Minjoon tackles and cuts it off!

As the ball was cleared long,

I smiled, seeing its direction.

Ah, if I miss this, I'll be an idiot.

Tuk!

Receiving the ball lightly as if catching a feather, I started running, with Virde Zule desperately following.

Focusing intently, as if the mistake at the end of the first half never happened.

-Minho Park! A heel chop to dodge Virde Zule! There's no one behind! No one! Kamiel Neuer rushes out! Minho Park! Minho Park!

-It's a loooob shoooot!

-Goooooal! Gooooal! Wow! Minho Park scores in the 42nd minute of the second half, making it 4-3 for Korea again!

-Hat-trick! Hat-trick! Minho Park scores his first hat-trick for the national team!

-Minho Park's one-man show! Dominating the game with 3 goals and 1 assist!

-Just hold on now! Just hold on!

Ssssshhh!

Sliding on my butt, I spread my arms wide.

Strangely, my butt feels wet.

Did they sprinkle a lot of water here?

I extended my celebration as long as possible to waste time.

At the same time, our coach moved busily.

It was now time to truly 'park the bus.'

Even I was called to the bench.

Slowly walking out, I encouraged applause, and the Korean fans clapped like fanatics, chanting my name.

Eventually, Germany's relentless attacks continued,

But they couldn't turn the game around.

As Tommy Kroos's final long-range shot veered far from the goal, the referee blew the whistle.

Beep! Beeeep! Beeeeeeep!

The game ended just like that.

[Comments]

-This must be a hidden camera prank, right?

-How can there be such a player in Korea? These guys are pulling a hidden camera prank.

-Haha, it's a fake documentary. How can a Korean player score a hat-trick against Germany? I don't believe it.

-Haha, stop with the hidden camera! It's not funny! Hahahahaha.

-???: If they score 3 goals, we score 4.

-Ah... Coach Bonfrere! Are you doing well up there?

-Hey, they're sending a living coach to heaven;

It was an amazing game.

We beat Germany 4-3.

Have we run too much?

The recovery training the next day was really tough.

Anyway.

With a good mood, we prepared for the next friendly against Turkmenistan.

Well, senior Shin Junseo and I had already discussed with the club that we wouldn't participate in the Turkmenistan match, so we could rest.

[Different from the Germany match! Korea loses 1-0 to Turkmenistan in a lackluster match!]

[Top Comment]

-Professor Park... where have you gone?

└Today's a day off.

As soon as the two of us were out, we lost 1-0.

And in a lackluster match.

Senior Shin Junseo covered his face with his hands and sighed deeply.

I wondered if this was the same team that played so passionately with me against Germany.

The last-minute mistake that led to conceding a goal was shocking.

"Isn't this the same team?"

Yes, it's definitely the same national team.

Why is our performance so different?
