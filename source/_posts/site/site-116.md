## 44. Lorenzo is Unstoppable! (1)

Lorenzo Lupo.

There was no particular reason why he recently became unfriendly to Park Minho.

“Lately, Minho has been passing to other guys more than me, so I got upset.”

Yes, he was grumbling over a rather trivial reason that he hadn't scored a goal with Park Minho recently.

At Lorenzo's words, Park Minho muttered in Korean, "What kind of crazy guy is this?"

Of course, the other players didn't pay much attention since Lorenzo Lupo was always half-crazy anyway.

Anyway.

Lorenzo Lupo thought.

Why hasn't Park Minho been passing to him lately?

After pondering and pondering, he concluded, "Because I'm too bad at soccer!"

"Normally, I would score with 10 out of 10 shots... missing one here! That's why Minho isn't passing to me!"

Of course, Park Minho didn't think that way.

It’s just... the play itself was designed for Lorenzo to head the ball down and either Park Minho would handle it directly, or he would connect it to another player breaking in from the side.

Naturally, Lorenzo Lupo had fewer chances to score compared to other forwards.

Despite the situation, he scored 15 goals in the league, earning the love of the Gunners' fans.

Everyone knew this fact.

Except for Lorenzo himself.

“This is the worst... Maybe I got too cocky after a bit of success in the EPL.”

He was not satisfied.

He wanted to become a better player than he was today.

He wanted to be a player who continuously improved.

So, he started focusing a bit more on training recently.

“Lorenzo! Take it easy.”

“There he goes again.”

“If he collapses later, it's not our fault.”

Despite some players trying to stop him, Lorenzo Lupo's determination never wavered.

He trained longer than other players to make up for his shortcomings.

To the point of being almost foolish.

Some called it overwork.

But for Lorenzo Lupo, it was a form of mental fortitude, so he couldn’t stop.

Then came the 22nd round league match against Aston Villa.

Lorenzo Lupo remained silent in this match as well.

“Not enough effooooooort.”

Lorenzo Lupo thought.

He decided to increase his training time by another hour.

Eventually, Park Minho had to step in.

“You blockhead! Take it easy!”

* * *

Lorenzo Lupo is a good player.

A player who always recognizes his own shortcomings.

Moreover, he has almost no arrogance, has a great desire for improvement, and is more passionate about soccer than anyone.

Of course, he has a bit of a weird mindset... Compared to eccentrics like Balotelli and others, Lorenzo Lupo wasn't the type of 'bad boy' who clashed with other players.

The only downside of this guy is that he thinks too much.

Not just during games, but in everyday life, he’s always lost in his own thoughts.

As a result, he hasn't fully integrated into the team yet.

How many players would stick around someone who spouts weird mental theories every day?

And he’s a bit clueless.

He doesn't seem to understand his own value.

Honestly, Lorenzo's current scoring pace is insane.

The problem is that he doesn't realize it himself.

Because of me, Lorenzo has been rotated a lot and has only played 17 league games.

Of those, he started in 12 games.

Fans who follow soccer closely know how little game time he was given.

Yet, within that limited time, he scored 15 goals, producing incredibly efficient offensive points.

He doesn't know that.

He looks at me and says,

“I realized by watching Minho. Forwards must score at least one goal every game!”

If an average forward scores one goal per game... Could Messi and Ronaldo remain legends?

This guy has a subtle greed and feels that his current performance is still lacking.

“Take it easy.”

I also stay an extra 1-2 hours after training to make up for my shortcomings before heading home, but this guy treats the training ground like his home, which worries me.

You have to know how to rest to have a long career as a soccer player... He doesn’t seem to get that.

“Minho... I can't rest.”

“Why?”

“Fans from Korea sent me letters. They sent all kinds of snacks and asked me to be a player who records offensive points in every game.”

“Isn't it impossible to score in every game?”

At my words, Lorenzo shook his head firmly.

He replied with a strangely determined expression,

“Minho! There's no such thing as impossible in this world.”

Ah... When he talks with such weight, he somehow looks cool.

“Minho, I'll show you! Humans are creatures with infinite potential.”

Yeah, you’re great.

Newcastle United.

Despite the enormous amount of oil money that has flowed in, they are still lingering in the mid-lower ranks of the league.

Is it the manager's problem?

Or the squad's problem?

I’m not sure, but... for now, Newcastle was struggling to stay in the league, sitting in 14th place.

Despite assembling a decent squad from each league, Newcastle looked like a ragtag team.

Honestly, I don't know why.

If you look at the players individually, they are certainly high-level and have great potential.

But strangely, when 11 of them play together, their performance is worse than a team in the Championship.

Still, thanks to the power of money, they were managing to stay in 14th place in the league with the two-man show of Kabil Fekir and Paulo Jimenez.

But Newcastle wouldn’t be satisfied with just this.

They invested a lot of money, so they wouldn’t just stand by and watch as they struggle in the mid-lower ranks of the league.

[Newcastle! Dive into signing Arsenal’s Marco Torreira!]

[Newcastle trying to snatch Marco Torreira from Real Madrid!]

So, to fill the midfield, which they felt was most lacking, they targeted Marco Torreira, who was in contract talks with Real Madrid.

It wasn’t a bad choice.

With their capital, they could easily bring Marco Torreira to their team.

But money couldn't solve everything in the world.

[Marco Torreira! Transfers to Real Madrid! Will be with Los Blancos for 3 years!]

Real Madrid, who offered less money than Newcastle, ended up signing Marco Torreira.

[Bernard Party! Re-signs with Arsenal!]

[Arsenal! Will they stay with Bernard Party until retirement?]

As Real Madrid chose Marco Torreira, we were able to keep Bernard Party.

Newcastle ended up with nothing.

Despite having more money than us or Real Madrid, Newcastle's record and reputation spoke for themselves.

It was true that you couldn’t buy a championship with money.

Even Manchester City took a few seasons to produce results, so it was clear that Newcastle still had many areas to improve.

Anyway.

Since Newcastle, who was overall a mess, was our next opponent, I wasn't too worried.

And on the match day.

Arriving at Newcastle's St. James' Park, we faced the home fans shouting, "Great Toon! Smash those Gunners!"

And on the field, Newcastle really played desperately as if to crush us, just as their fans shouted.

-Newcastle seems to be well-prepared.

-A pass connected to James Longstaff! And a long ball forward! Paulo Jimenez grabs the opportunity!

-Jimenez! Jimenez! He shoots! Goooooooooooooal!

-Newcastle scores the opening goal in just 16 minutes of the first half!

They were indeed a different team at home.

Watching Newcastle take the lead, I couldn't understand why they were in 14th place in the league.

But.

Despite scoring the opening goal, their defense revealed significant problems as they failed to maintain that lead.

Maybe it was because they were at home, but Newcastle was controlling the ball with overwhelming momentum.

It felt like the pressure we felt when playing against Man City, Man United, or Liverpool.

The problem was how long they could maintain it, and Newcastle started to waver significantly around the 20th minute of the first half.

-Tyler Smith Rowe receives Minho's pass! He charges forward!

Tyler Smith Rowe, who was placed in the third line for today's game, took my pass and advanced to a high position.

Newcastle, wanting to maintain their good momentum, was passionate in defense as well, but the problem was that their defense was weaker than expected.

-Ah! Damian Tetek's tackle! But it was short! Tyler Smith Rowe passes the ball centrally! Lorenzo! Lorenzo receives it and shoots!

-Gooooooooooooal! Just 5 minutes after conceding the opening goal, Arsenal equalizes!

-Lorenzo Lupo! It was a fantastic shot.

-A fantastic half-volley shot!

The guy who vowed to score responded to the Gunners with a fantastic goal.

“Woooooo! That's it! That's it!”

Lorenzo Lupo screamed and ran to the away section where the Gunners were, shouting.

Seeing this, he just looked like a very competitive world-class forward, but when he finished celebrating and returned to his position, the words he said to me confirmed he was indeed half-crazy.

“Minho, my goal for today's match was to score a hat-trick with half-volleys, right? But looking at my condition today, I think I can achieve that goal in the first half.”

It was an incredible confidence.

The problem was that it was only confidence.

He missed two crucial chances while trying half-volley shots.

Of course, his frightening presence did shake Newcastle's defense.

Thanks to that, I had a rare opportunity to move freely, and I didn't miss this chance.

-Minhoooooooo!

-A fantastic volley shot! Amazing! Arsenal's two forwards score two goals with volley shots!

-Arsenal takes the lead 2-1 at St. James' Park!

As soon as we succeeded in turning the game around, Newcastle showed signs of urgency.

Yes, this is why Newcastle is lacking compared to other money-built strong teams.

They definitely have excellent game performance.

The problem was that they couldn't maintain it.

Anyway.

I scored with a volley shot, approached Lorenzo, and expressed my ambition.

It was quite fun to tease Lorenzo at times like this.

“Lorenzo!”

“What is it?”

“Your goal of a half-volley hat-trick?”

“What about it?”

“I'll do it for you.”

Lorenzo looked dumbfounded at my words.

Your half-volley hat-trick!

It was replaced by my volley hat-trick.

Be always thankful, human.
