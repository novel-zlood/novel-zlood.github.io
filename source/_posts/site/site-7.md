## 3. A Genius Doesn't Know He's a Genius (1)

"Focus! Focus!"

The goalkeeper of Team A, who had just conceded a point in a disappointing manner, snapped at the dazed defenders.

Even if it was just practice, this was unacceptable.

At the very least, they should have made it difficult for the opponents to play comfortably.

"Defend properly! Think of it as a real match!"

The players nodded at the coach's shouts.

Soon, Gennaro Tatis's header, aimed at the high-flying ball, dropped onto the field.

Park Minho effortlessly caught it and immediately took a shot.

Naturally, his shot shook the net.

He didn't give the goalkeeper a chance to block it.

Team A had conceded two goals in an instant.

"Are you taking it easy just because it's practice? That was a situation you could have easily blocked!"

At the head coach's scolding, Team A's attackers sprang into action.

Desperate to recover at least one goal.

But.

Team B did not easily relinquish control.

With Park Minho at the center, the ball rotated more precisely among Team B's players than expected.

Like a heart pumping blood through veins, Team B's passes mostly went through Park Minho's feet and moved forward.

Admiring the way Park Minho even descended to the third line when necessary, Coach Alain Lavagne murmured in amazement.

"A player who can coordinate the entire team and has top-notch finishing skills... Truly astonishing."

And watching nervously from a distance was one person.

"......"

Franco Vasquez.

He was the original owner of the position Park Minho was playing.

If only he could recover from his injury...

Park Minho would probably be pushed back to being a backup.

In every aspect except for Franco Vasquez's playmaking, Vasquez was a step above Park Minho.

But he was impatient.

With a more threatening competitor than expected occupying the starting position he could easily reclaim if he returned slowly, his mind naturally grew anxious.

And that anxiety clouded his judgment.

Soon, he made a poor decision.

"Coach."

Franco Vasquez approached the head coach.

He was aiming to start in the upcoming friendly match against Genoa.

* * *

It's a mess.

I'm gasping for breath.

My legs felt slower than usual.

But, I was satisfied because Team A's defense was in worse shape than I was.

The defenders who had been taking it easy because it was just practice now had sharp gazes.

Even the regular starters were fired up.

With the starters, who usually had the luxury of being in the lineup, going all out, the younger and rotation players also had no choice but to give their all in this practice match.

"Pass! Pass!"

"Turn it to the flank!"

"Move it outside! Back inside!"

Time flew by quickly.

Whistle! Whistle! Whistle!

The coach blew the whistle signaling the end of the match.

Thus, the practice match ended.

The result was a 5-2 victory for Team B.

Having scored one goal and made two assists, I smiled contentedly.

Seeing my smile, Gennaro Tatis approached and patted my shoulder.

"Mino! You were awesome!"

Of course, he'd be happy.

I helped him score two goals.

"You were quite something. It was tough defending against you."

Even the intimidating Simon Thorpe approached and eagerly praised me.

But, can I really receive praise for this level of performance?

Isn't it just lip service?

"You're on a different level compared to Santiago."

"Don't even mention that bastard. I missed three goals in the last match because of him."

Gennaro angrily shouted.

Thank you, Santiago!

Thanks to you, I got praised.

How pathetic must his play have been for me to get praised for this level of play?

"At this rate, Mino, you might start in the season opener."

No way, that's too much.

Franco sees the game more broadly and has amazing technique... Honestly, that's a bit much.

But I will certainly be part of the first team.

I've already surpassed that South American pig.

Yes, starting with being in the first-team rotation.

Gradually increasing my playing time and making more contributions, many opportunities will come my way.

If I don't miss those opportunities... I can definitely survive in the professional world.

"Wow... Today's training was so tough."

"I thought I was going to throw up."

The players who hadn't yet gotten in shape for the preseason shook their heads, saying it was hard.

Naturally, I, whose stamina was far worse than the others, secretly threw up in a corner.

The spaghetti I had for lunch greeted me.

"Gather up!"

After a short break, our dapper French coach called us together.

"I will announce the starting lineup for the match against Genoa in two days."

Oh! Already making the announcement.

I heard there's no suitable player for the attacking midfielder position.

Maybe I'll start?

But that expectation was soon shattered.

I saw another player's name in the attacking midfielder position instead of mine.

"Franco?"

Wasn't he still in rehab?

I don't know why his name is on the list all of a sudden.

I must have been too optimistic.

My stomach felt a bit queasy.

* * *

Swoooosh!

After today's training schedule ended, I washed off the sweat in the club's shower room.

I was definitely satisfied.

I could understand why professionals can't give up soccer from today's training.

If training is this fun, what would it feel like to play in a real professional match?

I was really looking forward to it.

"Your skills are no joke."

While I was enjoying my shower.

An unexpected person appeared in front of me.

"Franco?"

"Mino, right? I watched today's match. Your passes were really accurate. Honestly, I was impressed."

Franco Vasquez.

I tensed up at his compliment.

Because I didn't get a good feeling from his tone.

However, I didn't sense any hostile emotions either.

Yes, it was like the gaze of someone looking at a competitor.

A competitor?

Franco Vasquez, who showed terrifying skills when I first saw him, considered me, who became a professional at 24, as a competitor?

This was quite surprising.

"I'll be starting in the next match against Genoa."

Franco's words made me curious.

Wasn't he still in rehab?

But he's playing in the next friendly match?

I didn't understand.

"Weren't you in rehab?"

"Someone's too good, you see."

Is he talking about me?

"I felt a bit threatened... And I thought it would be good for players in my position to learn from my play. So, I insisted a bit."

It seemed like a message for Santiago and me.

Even Santiago, who was washing his armpits a bit further away, looked at us with a peculiar gaze.

"Mino, you're a much better player than you think. But I won't give up my spot easily."

With a face full of determination, Franco stared at me for a moment before returning to his spot.

* * *

After Franco's declaration of war, Santiago and I started focusing more on training.

That didn't mean we were slacking off before.

It just meant we were more focused than before.

The unexpected thing was that the previously messy Santiago started losing weight.

I heard he lost 4 kilograms in no time.

When I grumbled to Gennaro that the competition for the starting spot might get tougher, he told me not to worry.

He said he told the coach in a meeting that he felt most comfortable playing with me.

"But Gennaro, why do you like playing with me so much? Is there a specific reason?"

I was curious.

Why does Gennaro like me the most?

Aren't Franco and Santiago better players than me?

Oh, I mean the Santiago who shed weight and got his act together.

A few days ago, I watched a video of Santiago playing in the Argentine league, and he looked like a soccer god slaughtering commoners on the field.

How did such a player become a South American sausage?

I don't get it.

Anyway.

Both players had clear strengths.

More so than me, who just became a professional.

"You match best as a second-line player with me."

"Me?"

"Franco's definitely better in terms of pass quality and timing compared to you or Santiago."

Yes, I firmly believe Franco's wide vision and excellent technique are far superior to mine.

"Santiago is an excellent player at digging into spaces, pulling defenders, and creating space for me. His on-the-ball play is outstanding, and his off-the-ball play is decent too."

Indeed, Santiago was a player with his own strengths.

When I watched the video of Santiago playing in the Argentine league, he was a top dribbler who manipulated space at will.

I had no choice but to acknowledge it.

"Franco can't provide that. He doesn't enjoy on-the-ball play as much."

"Hmm..."

"Santiago can't do what Franco does either."

Unlike those two, I don't know what strengths I have that Gennaro likes.

"But... Mino, you have the strengths of both. Franco doesn't have Santiago's on-the-ball ability, and Santiago doesn't have Franco's vision or passing sense."

"Me?"

"Yes, you're a hexagon-shaped player in the attacking midfielder position."

Hexagon-shaped player?

You mean I have all those skills?

Seeing my bewildered expression, Gennaro Tatis let out a long sigh.

"Mino, having talent in all abilities means you can show your worth no matter which coach you meet."

"Is that such a big deal?"

"It's driving me crazy."

"Why?"

"You don't seem to understand your value."

Well, if you suddenly tell me I'm a genius, I can't help but have a dumbfounded look.

Just a few days ago, I was an ordinary person.

"Franco can be stuck in the second team depending on the coach's preference, and Santiago can be released by a coach who values off-the-ball playmaking in the second line."

I know that well.

A great player can become a rotation member depending on the coach's preference, and a mediocre player can become a starter if they fit the coach's tactics.

I know that well.

"Mino, do you know why Franco chose to make his comeback in the Genoa match? It's because he's wary of you."

"I had a vague idea."

"No, you don't seem to understand your value."

Gennaro Tatis shook his head.

He's repeating the same thing again.

No, I get it.

So... you're saying I'm pretty good at football, right?

Right?

"Anyway, you're the only second-line player in our team who can create space for me while giving perfect passes and, if needed, score goals using me as a decoy."

"Alright, thanks for the compliment."

I still can't quite believe it.

Well, got it.

I have quite a bit of talent.

Seeing my puzzled expression as I nodded, Gennaro Tatis looked at me with an exasperated expression.

His eyes seemed to say, "This guy still doesn't quite get it, does he?"

* * *

Genoa CFC.

Gennaro Tatis told me that this mid-table Serie A team is so good at buying young talents cheaply, developing them, and selling them to big clubs that they're called the giants of Serie A.

I don't know how amazing that is.

In short, it's a team full of talented young players.

But because they sell and bring in players every season, their teamwork is like sand.

That's the evaluation of Genoa CFC.

We have a friendly match against such a team.

In 30 minutes, we'll face them on the field.

"Franco seems to have really sharpened his skills."

"Indeed."

Watching Franco lightly warming up on the field, both Gennaro and I felt a cool sensation like when Go Gil-dong becomes a swordmaster.

It's a playful expression, but... I really felt like Franco's passes were as sharp as a sword.

"Franco! Aren't you overdoing it?"

"This is basic."

Exchanging words with the coach while warming up slowly, Franco's eyes were full of confidence.

As long as he's not injured, Franco will prove his worth this season as well.

All the starters lightly warmed up and returned to the locker room.

Coach Alain Lavagne gave brief instructions and left the locker room.

Soon, both teams' players entered the field.

I sat on the bench with the other players.

I was honestly a bit excited.

Even though it was a friendly match, it was the first time I saw Franco playing in an actual game.

Whistle!

As soon as the referee blew the whistle, Genoa's players started running like mad to take control.

Honestly, saying they were running like mad was an understatement; Genoa's pressing was incredible.

As a result, Genoa dominated possession in the early part of the game and started bombarding Parma's defense.

-Ohhhhh!

In the 3rd and 6th minutes of the first half.

Two powerful shots were made, but both were cleanly blocked by Buffon, who leaped to save them.

For the first 10 minutes, Genoa's young players rampaged, showing off their strengths.

But as the 10 minutes passed, Parma, who had adapted to Genoa's pressing, started their counterattack.

"Wow! He can do that."

Receiving a long ball with ease, Franco Vasquez sent the ball into the wide-open space on the flank.

With that single pass, Genoa's left flank, which had pushed up, completely crumbled.

I really want to learn that.

From that crumbled left space, another attack route was created.

Gennaro, who had moved to the center, raised his hand.

It meant he would handle it.

Seeing his hand, the winger sent in a low cross.

But Genoa's defender was faster.

No, to be precise, his position was better.

Thump!

The defender quickly cleared the ball.

The ball went far.

And settled again at Franco Vasquez's feet.

As soon as he got the ball, Genoa's two midfielders pressed Franco hard.

But Franco was smooth.

"El gobernante!"

The nickname "The Ruler" or "The Monarch" suited him well.

Watching his second pass to Gennaro, I realized.

It was a pass that already ensured the result.

Thwack!

The ball cleanly hit the net.

Receiving Franco's killer pass, Gennaro Tatis easily shook the net, gifting Parma the opening goal.

Watching Franco create a goal with just two passes gave me goosebumps.

"Is that player my competitor?"

Will I be able to make my debut?

With that worry, a strange feeling began to pound my heart.

Honestly, I couldn't define what that emotion was.

But one thing was certain.

"I want to play on that field too."

Yes, I want to play on that field too.

This was clearer than any other thought.
