## 18. Coppa Italia and an Unbeaten Season (3)

After my interview was made public in the media,

AC Milan fans were a bit stirred up.

I thought I would get a lot of flak,

but the reaction was more lukewarm than I expected.

Some thought I was too arrogant,

while others liked my boldness.

Some even said they would forgive my arrogance if I transferred to AC Milan.

Various opinions came out.

-So, this is the player called Minho?

-Damn, he's incredibly fast!

-Damn it! If he transfers to Rossoneri and becomes our legend, I'll overlook that arrogant comment!

-Crazy! It's like watching Ronaldinho! And I mean Ronaldinho in his prime!

-No, he's more like Kaka! He's closer to Kaka than Ronaldinho!

Still, the most common sentiment was that I was cheeky... I should wear a mask quietly when I visit Milan.

On the other hand, when the reaction came out that AC Milan wanted to transfer me, Parma fans seemed quite shocked.

-Minho! We don't need a hat-trick, just stay with us for a long time! Please! Minhooooo!

-It will be depressing if the god leaves. I can never let Minho go to another club!

-Damn those Rossoneri scums! You already have plenty of forwards! Why do you want our Minho?

There were also desperate cries from the enraged fans.

And the response to those cries was equally impressive.

-Well... he's cheap and good! Do you think any team would leave a player worth 20 million euros who scored over 70 attack points in Serie B alone?

After hearing that response,

of course, the Parma fans' curses were directed not at AC Milan but at the Parma board.

-What kind of idiot sets a buyout clause at 20 million euros?

-Do the board members even think?

-Renew the contract with Parma's god immediately!

As a result, Parma's office was inundated with phone calls.

I heard that the staff sighed deeply, saying, "Here we go again."

Feeling a bit guilty, I bought some coffee and went to the office.

The words from Vitolo, the head of the operations team, were intense.

"Minho... let's make a 10-year contract with the highest salary."

"Are you crazy?"

"Yeah, I'm crazy."

He might really be crazy.

Seeing Vitolo pulling his hair out, I remember sneaking out of the office more quietly than anyone else.

-Monica: Minho! When you come home, buy some laundry detergent and chicken breast.

-Monica: We're out of chicken breast in the fridge.

-Park Minho: Got it.

Monica, who initially planned to stay for about a week, decided to stay until the end of the Italian Cup final.

Honestly, it's a bit comfortable,

but it makes me strangely nervous.

It's not that Monica is uncomfortable,

just... it feels weird.

It's not bad, but... just weird.

-Monica: Oh! And buy some bath bombs too!

-Park Minho: Why do you need bath bombs?

-Monica: Just because! :)

What does she mean by "just because"?

I don't understand.

* * *

"Minho... what's wrong with your face?"

I kept my mouth shut at the question from the lazy one.

I didn't want to answer.

"Are you not feeling well today?"

"I guess even Minho has days like this."

"Now you look like a human."

"Well... who in the world feels great every day? But I've never seen you with dark circles before."

"Isn't your face looking a bit sunken?"

My teammates were talking about me.

But I had no choice but to keep my mouth shut.

I'm really struggling.

Why am I struggling?

Oh no! The kids don't need to know.

Everyone gathered in the big hall.

It was to analyze AC Milan.

Assistant coach Matteo appeared with the materials.

"Minho? What's wrong with your face today?"

"I'm not feeling well."

"Oh dear... luckily there's no schedule today?"

"Yeah, fortunately."

Do I look that bad?

I checked my face via the front camera of my smartphone... I did look a bit thin.

Hmm...

I must eat something hearty and greasy today.

I should ask Monica to make it.

"Okay! Is everyone here?"

The analysis began.

As a large screen displaying AC Milan's games appeared on the projector, assistant coach Matteo started speaking.

"AC Milan's coach Andrea Celentano often says he benchmarks Bayern Munich's playing style the most."

Click.

When assistant coach Matteo pressed the remote, movements of AC Milan and Bayern Munich appeared simultaneously on the screen.

Indeed... even a quick glance showed similarities.

"Of course, that doesn't mean they are exactly the same. The strong pressing, compact movements, and offensive positioning of Bayern are similar... but the squad characteristics of Munich and Milan are completely different."

Leo's client, Bruno Campos, who has been showing a lot of interest in me on social media lately, appeared.

"First... the player our attackers need to be most cautious of is this Bruno Campos."

Bruno Campos.

A defensive midfielder with excellent dribbling skills and on-the-ball technique.

Additionally, his passing ability is top-notch, making his long passes from the third line to the flanks or the front line exceptional.

He is technically proficient and highly active, making him a valuable player for any team.

"A versatile midfielder who can play as a number 10, 8, or 6... his understanding of positions is also excellent, making him a player much loved by coaches."

"Recently, he's been playing as a defensive midfielder, showing a very offensive style due to his excellent on-the-ball skills."

"Thanks to that, when deployed as a single pivot, he is somewhat vulnerable in protecting the back four..."

The next screen showed Bruno Campos' partner.

Playing alongside Abraham Kessie, they perfectly complemented each other's weaknesses.

While Abraham Kessie actively moved in both defense and attack with his high work rate,

Bruno spent time creating attacks with his excellent dribbling and passing skills.

As a result, AC Milan had a high win rate when both players played together.

Conversely, AC Milan's win rate dropped significantly when even one of the two players was absent.

"Not easy to target."

"Right. Since the season is almost over and the opponent is also aiming for the Coppa Italia victory."

Probably, both midfielders will play.

Turning my attention to the defense, I noticed a few more players to watch out for.

"Vigo Kjaer."

"The toughest opponent."

"It won't be easy, right?"

Vigo Kjaer.

The core of AC Milan's defense.

The leader of the defense.

Although underrated in Korea as a failed prospect,

he was ranked 18th in the 2021 Ballon d'Or standings, indicating his exceptional ability.

He is a player who can perform both commander and fighter roles as a center-back, excelling in one-on-one defense, adjusting the defensive line, and maintaining gaps.

Since Vigo Kjaer joined AC Milan, there have been almost no complaints about their defense.

In the analysis video, Vigo Kjaer seemed to be evaluated as the best defender in Serie A.

"Well... a center-back without any flaws?"

I agreed somewhat with Gennaro Tatis' words.

He really was a flawless defender.

Moreover, with the influence of Vigo Kjaer, Matthew Tomori, who had transferred from Chelsea to AC Milan, showed nearly impenetrable defensive skills.

With his man-marking skills, previously criticized as ragged defense at Chelsea, combined with Vigo Kjaer's experience, he became an almost complete center-back.

I have to score against such players.

Strangely, it feels both exciting and thrilling.

My fists clenched and unclenched involuntarily.

* * *

"A damn forward."

Vigo Kjaer muttered as he watched Park Minho shown by coach Andrea Celentano.

His unpredictable movements and overall excellent abilities made him a tough opponent.

Usually, such versatile players are poor at goal-scoring...

But this monster had recorded over 70 attack points this season.

"Are you telling us to stop that monster?"

Matthew Tomori also clicked his tongue while staring intently at Park Minho in the video.

Certainly, there was a weakness.

He debuted this year and lacked experience,

but strangely, he didn't seem inexperienced.

"A player who scores goals like Lewandowski and dribbles like Neymar... If I could stop that, I wouldn't be playing for AC Milan but Real Madrid by now."

"I agree. Moreover, he would've won the Ballon d'Or by now."

"If anyone can completely stop that monster... they truly deserve the Ballon d'Or."

Other defenders nodded grimly.

Among them, Bruno Campos looked at Park Minho's video with a face full of anticipation.

'So this is Leo's 10th client?'

He understood why Leo sought his help to sign this friend.

With such skills,

it would be painful to miss out on him.

Simultaneously, it also stirred excitement.

"I heard his transfer fee is 20 million euros?"

"Really?"

"I wish he would come to Rossoneri..."

"It would be great if he came."

"With Olivier Giroud frequently injured and Zlatan nearing retirement..."

How fun would football feel playing alongside such a forward?

Bruno Campos quietly sent Leo a text message.

He wanted to meet Park Minho in person later.

* * *

-Goooooal!

-Minho scores the winning goal!

-Minho! Truly amazing! His terrifying scoring pace never slows down!

In the remaining three league matches, Parma won all games with high scores.

Simultaneously, I scored 43 goals in the league.

I became the Serie B top scorer, outpacing Alfredo Donnarumma, who scored 38 goals, by 5 goals.

I also recorded 32 assists in the league, topping the assist chart.

The lazy one was second in assists,

with exactly half of mine, 16.

38 matches, 35 wins, 3 draws, 0 losses.

When we achieved an unbeaten season in the league,

the news of our unbeaten season spread widely in the media.

[Parma Calcio! Writing history in Serie B!]

[A man who became the 'God of Parma' by recording 43 goals and 32 assists in 38 league matches, Park Minho!]

[Minho, receiving tremendous support to the extent that Parma fans stick his photo and pray!]

[Now, only the Coppa Italia final remains!]

[Can Parma defeat AC Milan and achieve the double?]

[Can Minho bring the cup to his team in the Coppa Italia, just like Roberto Mancini, the 'God of Sampdoria'?]

-Minhooooooo!

-Minho is a god! Minho is a god!

-Messi is not a god to us! Only Minho is our god!

-Serie A doesn't scare us! Because we have Minho! Waaaaaaah!

-Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!

-From now on, racial discrimination against Koreans will be strictly punished in the Parma region!

-Minho! Don't leave! If you leave, I'll really die!

All of Parma went into a frenzy.

It was the first unbeaten season in Parma's history.

No, it was the first unbeaten season in Serie B history.

Maybe that's why the reaction was even more intense.

The day after the league matches ended, I went shopping in the city.

Everyone recognized me, no lie.

When I told my family about this, their reaction was lukewarm.

My mother said she was more amazed that I scored a hat-trick against Germany.

She shared how proud she was of me to our relatives.

Especially my aunt, who seemed to boast a lot about me.

My cousin, Jinseong, seemed to be having a hard time.

He later texted me, "Hyung! Please stop scoring goals! My ears are going to burst!"

Well, I also got nagged a lot by my mom because my aunt bragged a lot about you getting into law school.

You need to experience it too.

Oh, and Roberto, upon achieving the unbeaten season, broke his savings and bought me an expensive luxury watch as a gift.

When I tried to refuse,

Roberto tearfully said, "Parma, which went bankrupt, achieved an unbeaten season. What's a luxury watch compared to that?"

When I wore the gifted watch, he knelt down and cried as if worshiping a god.

I accepted it.

Honestly, it feels too burdensome.

But later, I plan to give Roberto a much more expensive gift.

Monica compared Parma's unbeaten season to Arsenal's and looked at me with a strange gaze.

She had been quiet recently.

It seemed like her inner 'Gooner Monica' and 'Girlfriend Monica' were having a fierce battle.

Thus, April passed, and

May arrived.

With a few days left until the Coppa Italia final on May 11, 2022, we headed early to Rome, where the Stadio Olimpico is located.

The match to decorate the end of my first professional season was slowly approaching.
