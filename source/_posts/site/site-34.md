## 14. The Giant and the Baby Striker (2)

Today's match felt like the one where I was substituted the quickest since my pro debut.

I was substituted in the 10th minute of the second half and surprisingly sat on the bench in a rather fresh state, contrary to my expectations.

Many starters were left out in preparation for the match against Inter.

I'm satisfied with the 1 goal and 1 assist I recorded in the first half.

Thanks to Kenneth handling the physical battles in my place, I truly enjoyed the game like a prince.

Gennaro, who played 10 minutes longer than me, came to the bench with a bright smile.

"This was the most enjoyable soccer of my life."

I agreed with him.

This was the most fun soccer I've ever played.

Our Kenneth, who resembles the Moai statues, showed his consistent performance even with the 3-5-2 formation change.

- Gooooooal!

- The score is now 6 to 0!

- Perugia takes a huge blow!

In his debut match, Kenneth recorded 1 goal and 3 assists.

It's only natural that Parma fans are ecstatic about Kenneth.

Waaaaaaaah!

Kenneth! Kenneth! Kenneth!

Any fan who didn't cheer this loudly for a rookie who showed such an incredible performance right after debuting is probably a fan of a rival team.

Or maybe got hit by Kenneth.

But would one's bones be okay if hit by that guy?

- The match ends!

- Perugia suffers their worst defeat and remains 18th in the league!

- Depending on the situation, they could drop to 20th place, making this defeat incredibly painful.

After the match, our coach Alain Lavagne finally smiled brightly, relieved.

This tactic worked quite well.

And the performance of Kenneth, an 18-year-old young striker, was also impressive.

All the concerns were resolved.

Of course, it's less likely that things will go this smoothly against Inter.

They are the defending champions of Serie A.

Although we are on an unbeaten streak.

We are a team that got relegated from Serie A last year.

After the match, I got a message from Monica.

Lately, she's been oddly interested in our team players and keeps saying, "How would this guy fit in Arsenal?"

Santiago and Kenneth this time.

- Monica: Kenneth... He's a player that suits Arsenal.

- Monica: With Minho at 10, Santiago at 7, and Kenneth at 9... King's Arsenal is coming closer.

- Monica: Even though Arsenal is struggling at 6th in the league... With a little momentum, they have the power to win.

Is this that Ripley syndrome or something?

But I can't argue because our Monica is really scary.

I think I understand why dad always loses arguments with mom and ends up sulking in the bedroom.

Monica, seemingly annoyed by my silence, sent me some photos.

- Monica: (A photo in a bikini)

- Monica: (A photo emphasizing her chest)

Pretty girls really go overboard sometimes, don't they?

How can I argue after seeing these?

- Park Minho: Arsenal is indeed the best!

Yeah, I'm a man who sold his soul for a chest.

* * *

Santiago has returned to training.

While the veteran Giovanni is still groaning, our young winger, the slick one, is lively.

I heard his body recovered 2-3 days faster than expected, making him available for the Inter match.

When the slick one appeared at the training ground, the slightly quiet atmosphere became bustling again.

"Minho! How have you been?"

The slick one showed up with his glossy face.

I heard he even stopped drinking his favorite zero cola to recover quickly.

It seems that effort paid off.

"How's your body?"

"Great! But just in case, the doctor said to only train in the morning today."

"Really? Then let's have dinner later."

"Sure! Then come to my place! My aunt said she'd cook an amazing beef dish."

I can't resist beef.

Moreover, I remember Santiago's aunt from last time when she made us Asado.

She was really good at cooking.

"Can I bring Kenneth too?"

"That big Moai?"

"Moai?"

"Yeah! He looks like a Moai statue."

Come to think of it, he kind of does.

So I asked Kenneth if he wanted to join us for beef.

Fortunately, our Kenneth is not shy.

After the morning training, Santiago went home.

We finished the afternoon training and headed to Santiago's house.

Santiago's aunt welcomed us.

We couldn't communicate well, but we managed to talk using a mix of body language and English.

In the yard, beef ribs were tied to a big iron rod, cooking over charcoal for a long time.

The table was filled with all kinds of food.

Santiago was staring at the charcoal fire, seemingly mesmerized.

It looked like everything was ready.

"But isn't it bad to eat red meat when you have a muscle injury?"

With my limited medical knowledge, I thought it was better to avoid red meat if you have muscle inflammation.

Santiago smiled at my question.

"I asked the doctor, and he said a little is okay."

"But... Is this amount considered a little?"

It seemed like a lot.

But Kenneth and Santiago didn't think so.

They looked at me strangely, as if to say this was a normal amount to eat.

The meal was, of course, excellent.

Santiago's aunt's cooking skills were no joke.

Eating it again now, I realized she was indeed a great cook.

When I sent a photo to Monica, she seemed like she was about to cry.

She said she was really depressed because she had to eat tasteless greens due to her recent schedule.

After a light(?) meal, we played with the ball in the yard.

Santiago's aunt looked at us with a pitying expression.

I didn't understand why.

She kindly explained the reason when she saw us off at the entrance.

"Next time you come, bring a girlfriend!"

Auntie, I already have a girlfriend.

It's just that only the slick one and Kenneth don't have one.

* * *

With Santiago joining, the power of the 3-4-3 formation became even stronger.

Especially, the combination of Kenneth and the slick one was quite good.

With fancy dribbling, if the slick one sent a high cross, Kenneth would either score with a header or pass it to me or Gennaro.

Recently, Kenneth got a nickname.

He was called Moai because he resembled the Moai statues.

Many friends started calling him Moai.

Kenneth seemed to like the nickname because when he asked for a second autograph, he asked for it to be addressed to "Moai" instead of "Kenneth."

The slick one and Moai.

It’s quite a fitting combination.

Thanks to them, these two are often seen training together at the training ground these days.

I, too, have been seeing results from my basic training recently.

Watching videos and imitating others has its limits, so I focused more on basic skills.

Now, I reached a point where I could control the plays I used to follow just by instinct.

You might ask if this is such a big deal.

Why do we emphasize basic skills so much?

It's to respond to variables.

When unexpected variables arise, players with weak basic skills are bound to react a bit slower.

This inevitably affects their performance.

Mimicking plays from videos is also a card you can only use in similar situations.

Achieving mastery with my body means I can adapt and use techniques I've learned from videos in any situation.

Our coach once said,

"Initially, you ran like Özil, then like Robben in the middle, and now like Ronaldo. Recently, you run like no one but Park Minho."

I feel like my style is gradually being established.

What kind of player will I become?

Will I be someone who’s neither this nor that?

Or...

Will I be a player who leaves a name in history?

Honestly, I don't know.

But I think I know one thing.

At least for this season, I am definitely the best player in Parma.

* * *

There’s a saying.

"The known taste is scary."

Because it's a familiar and ordinary taste, anyone can easily approach it and generally find it delicious.

[Parma! Another rising star? Who is Kenneth Marseutico?]

[Debut match with 1 goal and 3 assists! How did Parma succeed with both Minho and Kenneth?]

[Overwhelming physicality! What future holds for the 18-year-old striker from Slovenia?]

[The return of Peter Crouch? Parma fans shocked by Kenneth's debut!]

The media is noisy.

And experts are having a field day.

They've seen a lot of similar players.

They've seen many of them succeed.

That's why they call it "the known taste."

Good at post-play.

Weak at footwork.

Everyone knows what kind of player this is at a glance.

But because everyone knows, they let their guard down.

And even knowing, they fall for it.

They know.

They know how to stop it.

But strangely enough, they fall for it easily.

Isn't there a similar player at Wolverhampton?

Adama Traoré.

A dribbling specialist who runs like a bull.

Everyone knows, but he breaks through.

Even though it's a straightforward and simple breakthrough.

Well, his crossing is quite lacking though.

That's why I liked it so much.

He moved as I expected.

It made it easy for me to think.

Using Kenneth as a shield, it was easy to move, and Lautaro, who marked me in training, grumbled.

"Stop hiding behind the Moai statue already."

But what can I do?

I’m still a novice striker who just stepped into the front line.

So it's natural to get help.

Isn't it too easy-going?

No, I’m working quite hard too.

Of course, it’s true that my activity has significantly decreased since Kenneth joined, but...

But I’m scoring goals well.

Aren't I?

Anyway.

Inter's coach Inzaghi, perhaps mindful of the newly debuting young striker Kenneth, made a remark in an interview.

[Inzaghi, "We are aware of Parma's 18-year-old striker. This player can provide incredible attacking options to Parma's ace Minho, so we must be cautious."]

Indeed, as expected of a coach who has lifted the championship cup several times.

He knows the "known taste" is scary too.

In that sense, I, a novice striker, also intend to make good use of this "known taste."

"Baby."

"Are you crazy?"

The slick one frowned at my baby talk joke.

But honestly, it's funny.

And I am a baby striker, right?

I've only played half a season!

* * *

Coach Inzaghi, with tired eyes, watched the Parma vs. Perugia match again.

"Amazing."

How can he move like that?

Despite not having much experience in the front line, this Asian player was showing off-the-ball movement and goal-scoring ability comparable to a certain Polish striker in no time.

The more surprising part was that this wasn’t the end.

This player, with the awkward-to-pronounce name Park Minho, becomes a completely different player in the second line.

In some matches, he looked like Özil.

In others, he ran like Ronaldo.

In yet another, he played like Hazard.

"He feels like he’s constantly evolving."

Inter must stop such a player.

Can they stop him?

It's possible.

Football is a team sport where individual influence has its limits.

Therefore, the target in this match should be not Park Minho but the young 18-year-old promising striker Kenneth Marseutico.

His physicality is world-class, but his footwork is below the Serie A average, so with some preparation, he can be tackled.

"Moreover, he lacks experience."

Indeed, Parma's first-team strength is at the Serie A team level.

However, their depth and experience are lacking.

Veterans are concentrated in the defense.

The only veteran in the attacking line is Franco.

But he is likely to drop back to the less pressured third line against Inter.

An inexperienced attacking line.

Exploiting this could be enough to overcome.

Even Parma's ace, Park Minho, has only half a season of professional experience.

"Alright. If we set up the defense like this..."

They would easily block Parma's attacking line.

Coach Inzaghi clenched his fist with conviction.

This Coppa Italia quarterfinal.

The winner will be Inter.
