## 41. Boxing Day (1)

The Serie A and EPL are definitely different.

The schedule is so tight that it quickly becomes exhausting. Knowing this, our coach tried to preserve our stamina as much as possible by rotating the players.

Thanks to this, even though we had some injuries, none of our players were so physically drained that their form dropped.

Still, it was a bit tough.

But that was inevitable.

There were just too many games crammed into December.

Anyway.

In Korea, people are going crazy because I'm on the Ballon d'Or podium, but honestly, it doesn't really hit me, so I just let it be.

However, there's controversy about why I didn't win the Ballon d'Or despite having better stats, with some saying it's another case of racial discrimination.

There's even talk on social media about how the cameras subtly turn away the moment an Asian player lifts a trophy.

Hmm... This never happened in Serie A, so I didn't pay much attention.

To be precise, they wouldn't dare do that to me because the broadcasting station would be set on fire by the ultras of Parma.

[Controversy as a tourist in a West Ham uniform was assaulted in downtown Parma and left with an 8-week injury!]

The Parma fans still treat me like a 'god' even though I left the team.

Racism in front of those fans?

The name of the cameraman who committed the racial discrimination would be engraved on a tombstone on the outskirts of Parma.

Some fervent Parma fans even visited Arsenal's club community and told the Gunners to cherish their 'god' and send him back to their club in his prime.

Anyway.

Racial discrimination is still a hot issue.

On top of that, the grueling schedule in December was quickly draining my stamina, so it was tough.

Fortunately, I was benched for the next match against Southampton, and even with significant rotation, the team secured a 3-0 victory against Southampton.

At the same time, Arsenal had 14 wins, 1 draw, and 0 losses in 15 league games, starting to evoke memories of the unbeaten championship season.

Sometimes I think.

-But won't there be a game we lose eventually?

Even though I experienced an unbeaten championship with Parma, I know how truly great that record is.

It's really tough.

So I often predict that there will eventually be a game we lose and organize my thoughts.

Of course, Monica called it 'blasphemous thinking!' and nagged me, but I really think an unbeaten championship is a difficult feat.

-Minhoooooooo! A fantastic winning goooooooal!

-Minho scored a fantastic winning goal in the last group stage match of the Europa League for a 2-1 victory!

-Arsenal these days are really fierce! Even more formidable than the Arsenal of the 03-04 season!

We won 2-1 against Lazio in the final group stage match of the Europa League.

I also scored a goal lightly.

Then came the league's 16th round match against Burnley on December 17th.

Arsenal continued to rotate appropriately to stack up another win.

Pedro Ocampos, who was starting after a long time, had been silently focusing on training after returning to the first team following a recent suspension.

He was given this chance to play because some stats were needed to sell him in the winter.

If not for that, he might have rotted in the second team forever... or so I thought.

So, did it pay off? Pedro Ocampos scored a goal in today's match.

Moreover, his movements were definitely not bad.

-Arsenal is hammering Burnley! The gap is already 3 points!

-Their movements are really good today!

We widened the gap by 3 points in the first half.

In the second half, we added 2 more goals to end the game 5-0.

When a person is cornered, they definitely show more amazing performance than usual.

Well, despite his great performance, Pedro Ocampos's face didn't look very happy.

He clearly wanted to leave the team quickly.

If he transfers to another team, he might do this kind of interview...

-I wasn't happy at Arsenal. They didn't respect me.

Anyway.

Despite the joy of victory, the entire team looked visibly exhausted.

We played 5 games in 2 weeks.

With a few days left until Boxing Day, the team's fatigue was even more severe.

The fatigue was so intense that even Tyron Tierney, who had long experience in the EPL, couldn't fully withstand it.

“No matter how long I play in the EPL, I can never get used to Boxing Day. It's a really f**king schedule.”

Other Arsenal players agreed with him.

The only relief was that most of the matches until December 26th were against weaker teams.

This meant we had a good opportunity to get ahead of the competition, and if we could endure this hellish December, we could continue to accumulate victories in the second half with the same performance.

However, the problem was after the 26th.

The match on the 26th was the League Cup quarter-final.

The opponent was Manchester United.

And on January 1st, we had the 19th round league match against Manchester United.

[Ronaldo: 'I will show that I am superior in the two consecutive matches against Arsenal on Boxing Day.']

And then there's this guy causing a stir again.

I have 23 league goals, leading the scoring chart.

He is second with 20 goals.

It seems like Ronaldo is trying to have one last dance, maintaining a surprisingly good form in December, leading Manchester United to third in the league.

As a result, the two consecutive matches against Manchester United on December 26th and January 1st were drawing significant interest from football fans.

Well, I was just going with the flow.

But the people around me reacted to his words and expected me to score.

Monica threatened that if I didn’t score a hat-trick, she would make my nights miserable.

Hmm, should I give up on the hat-trick?

Maybe scoring just 2 goals would be enough.

Ahem... Ahem.

No, I was just saying.

A hat-trick is nice too.

But multi-goals are also good.

The beauty of restraint.

Isn't that nice?

* * *

While Park Minho boasts similar scoring ability to Ronaldo, the reason he is rated higher is because he consistently records assists along with that scoring ability.

In 16 league games, he has already scored 23 goals and added 12 assists.

There was no expert who underestimated Park Minho, who was recording nearly two attacking points per game.

Of course, despite this performance, there were still those who continued to criticize Park Minho.

They mainly operated in Korean overseas football communities.

Korean football fans referred to their existence as follows.

‘Ppakachung.’

It originated from ‘Ppakka,’ which means to criticize Park Minho, and ‘Chung,’ which means to be diligent, combined to form ‘Ppakachung,’ a derogatory term for those who mindlessly belittle Park Minho.

-So, has Park Minho ever won the Champions League?

-Haha, honestly, Park Minho is just benefiting from the team. At least he should prove himself at a team like Burnley and then come up.

-Yes, Park Minho's mediocre physicality would get totally wrecked by someone with overwhelming physicality like David Pabunong.

They claimed that Park Minho's skills would soon be exposed, and that he would go to China to make some money and retire next season.

Of course, their existence was so minor that no one paid much attention to them.

When Arsenal rotated almost completely in the match against Watford on December 23rd, they bizarrely criticized Park Minho for finally being demoted from the starting spot.

If you ask why I'm bringing this up now, it's because Park Minho had no choice but to look at Monica, who was pounding the keyboard in anger.

-Yes, Park Minho has 0 Ballon d'Ors. He will get schooled by Ronaldo in the League Cup quarter-finals haha.

Park Minho couldn’t understand why she was so angry about that.

But what could he do?

Monica, with those resentful eyes, told him to definitely win… He had to win somehow.

Thinking that way, Park Minho sat on the sofa, eating chicken breast and turned on the TV.

December 26th.

In other leagues, it would be time to rest and prepare for the second half, but the EPL was busy with Boxing Day.

Lorenzo Lupo laughed at my tired expression and told me to do my best, but he looked even more pitiful with the fatigue showing in his eyes.

It's an away game at Old Trafford.

I came here at the beginning of the season, and it still feels like a place where the past and present coexist.

As I walked through the small passage leading to the main tunnel, I saw Manchester United players waiting for us.

Seeing the faces of those who I severely dealt with at the beginning of the season gave me a strange feeling.

It felt like the first half of the season was already ending, and at the same time, I could sense Ronaldo glaring at me fiercely.

The Manchester United anthem started to hit my ears.

As soon as we entered the field, some Manchester United fans who recognized me started to boo.

Hearing those boos made me really want to win.

Having received Monica's request to definitely win the League Cup quarter-final also made me want to win even more.

The players of both teams shook hands.

Junseo hyung shook my hand with a wistful look, which made me feel sad.

He looked really pitiful.

I've heard he's been having a hard time at Manchester United lately... It seems like things aren’t going well for him here either.

“Minho, let’s at least win the League Cup!”

Even asking so earnestly in the tunnel.

When I answered that I wouldn’t score in today’s match, he showed a look of expectation, asking ‘Really? Really?’

Yeah, I’m not going to score, but I’ll do a ‘hat-trick of assists.’

Anyway.

The League Cup quarter-final match began.

Manchester United came out with a 4-3-3 formation featuring Jadon Sancho, Ronaldo, and Shin Junseo as the front three.

Honestly, their attacking line wasn’t particularly scary.

Rather, it was Derek de Jong, who dominated Manchester United’s midfield, that was truly annoying.

Just five minutes into the first half, he intercepted a pass intended for me and almost recorded an attacking point with a splitting pass.

-Derek de Jooooooong!

-Wow! He intercepted it here and connected it to a counterattack... but Ronaldo’s finish was sloppy, so a great chance was missed!

That guy missed a great chance and gave a thumbs up to Derek.

Anyway.

Manchester United seemed well-prepared and started to outpace us in terms of possession and many other metrics from the beginning.

Honestly, I think our defense has been really solid lately, but Derek de Jong’s passes were frequently targeting the gaps in our defense.

Mario Fernandez, who moved up to midfield, was also definitely not an easy opponent.

Several sharp passes were directed towards Junseo hyung, who was moving into the open space.

Indeed, the performance of a title-contending team was different.

Lately, we had many clean sheets against mid to lower-tier teams, so perhaps the entire team had become slightly arrogant.

Anyway, if the opponent was troubling our defense, I was also diligently troubling Manchester United’s defense.

“Fxxk! Someone stop that damn colt!”

At the shout of goalkeeper Jordi De Gea, James McGuire rushed towards me, but I cleanly connected the ball to Lorenzo Lupo.

No, are you the only ones who can pass?

I can also make such passes.

Moreover, unlike that old man of Manchester United, the Italian giant leading Arsenal's frontline wouldn’t miss my quality pass.

-Minho! A fantastic pass!

-And Lorenzo Lupo catches the ball! And! And! Shooooooots! Goooooooal!

-In the 15 minutes of the first half, with Manchester United dominating, Arsenal takes the lead with a single counterattack!

After scoring the goal, Lorenzo Lupo ran towards the home fans of Old Trafford and performed Ronaldo’s celebration.

Yes, the ‘Sii’ celebration.

It was a provocation saying, I scored, and you didn’t.

How was the reaction?

Of course, it was chaotic.

“You f**king bastard! You’re dead! Come here! You f**king son of a b***h! Come here!”

“Kill him! Break that scarecrow’s leg!”

“Fxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxk!”

Even Manchester United players were angry at the celebration and started arguing with Lorenzo Lupo.

I was worried they might actually start fighting, but instead, two fans near the away section fought on our behalf.

-Oh! Fans from both teams are fist-fighting!

A Gunner throwing a left hook and a Red Devil countering by hitting the Gunner’s jaw.

Of course, the game briefly halted, and the guards at the stadium intervened to stop the fight.

“Hmm... Looking at their faces, our Gunner with a bleeding nose seems to have lost.”

Casually hydrating, Tyron Tierney, and the home fans chanting ‘Bleeding Nose Gunner!’ made me quietly think.

Is this why they call it ‘Boxing’ Day?

That kind of thought.
