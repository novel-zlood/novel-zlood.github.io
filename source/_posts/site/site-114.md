## 43. Title Contender (1)

As soon as the first half ended, Coach Alain Levagne immediately called in several key players, including Park Minho.

Southampton, aiming for a comeback in the second half, quickly substituted two players right after halftime, but they couldn't penetrate Arsenal's surprisingly solid defense and wasted their time.

Particularly, they struggled to advance the line against Jules Kaembe, who seemed to have broken through a barrier and was showing powerful dribbles.

Because of this, Southampton's offense, which had scored in the first half, began to falter.

With no proper attacks, Arsenal's defense became even more stable compared to the first half, and Southampton couldn't seize any significant opportunities until the end of the second half.

Southampton's coach, Galma Gertholf, tore at his hair and shouted.

"No! Why does it have to be Arsenal!"

His voice, full of frustration, was drowned out by the boos from the home fans, just as the referee blew the whistle.

Beep! Beeep! Beeeep!

-The game ends here! Arsenal wins 3-1 in the second leg, with Mino scoring a hat-trick in the first half!

-Arsenal secures a spot in Wembley Stadium! How long has it been since the last final?

Arsenal's victory was secured by defending the three goals scored in the first half.

Of course, the Gooners were delighted.

Although the match wasn't as important as other tournaments, it was hard to recall the last time they won the League Cup.

"We're... in the final?"

"How long has it been?"

"Honestly, I feel like I'm a brain in a jar being stimulated by electricity, and in reality, Arsenal is relegated to the second division."

Moreover, they were impressed by Jules Kaembe's explosive performance, whom they had brought from Southampton.

[Jules Kaembe! Explosive Performance!]

[Kaembe makes a debut as a winger in the EPL! Shows overwhelming performance at Arsenal!]

[Jules Kaembe: 'Mino taught me a lot. He is like a benefactor to me.']

[Southampton hit hard by their own transfer! Knocked out in the League Cup semi-finals!]

-Woohoo! Minoooooooo!

-Mino is a god! Mino is a god! Mino is a god! Mino is a god! Mino is a god! Mino is a god!

-This means we're in the League Cup final!

-Jules Kaembe! Truly refreshing!

-This is it! This is Arsenal!

Of course, the joy was short-lived.

The next match following the Southampton game was against Liverpool, who were closely trailing Arsenal in the Premier League Round 21.

* * *

Recently, Monica can't stop smiling.

No, to be precise, her face was full of happiness until the Southampton game ended.

What about now?

She's extremely nervous about the upcoming Liverpool match.

Even if it’s not other teams, Liverpool is the only team this season that has been keeping up with Arsenal's winning streak.

Moreover, Liverpool filled the vacancy in their forward position by bringing in Kashan Vlahovic from Atletico Madrid, who had missed the first half due to injury.

Kashan Vlahovic adapted quickly to Liverpool, scoring goals without needing much time, raising the expectations of the Kop.

Facing an already tough opponent who now had an outstanding forward made it clear the upcoming match wouldn't be easy.

"Mino! Why doesn't Arsenal have any big signings?"

I couldn't give Monica a proper answer.

Our side was still struggling to focus on retaining our players.

[Bernard Party! Transferring to Real Madrid?]

[Real Madrid targets Marco Torreira and Bernard Party!]

[PSG joins the race for Marco Torreira!]

[Arsenal in a major crisis! At risk of losing two key midfielders!]

Unexpectedly, Arsenal's players looked quite appealing to other clubs.

Given their superb performance in the first half of the season... it made sense.

As a result, our coach, Arsenal's board, scouts, and coaching staff were all on high alert.

Although renewal negotiations had begun, the two players seemed to be heavily considering the allure of Real Madrid.

Even during training, they seemed somewhat distracted.

However, we had enough depth in central resources to hold out until a replacement was found.

Additionally, Tyler Smith Rowe, who played as a wing forward, could also play centrally.

So, there wasn't a major issue.

But that didn't mean the situation was entirely favorable.

With various transfer rumors dampening the team's atmosphere, they had to face Liverpool.

Well... Korean communities weren't concerned about such things, instead posting memes from Japanese ninja animations and exclaiming, "My heart is swelling with pride!"

On the contrary, Monica was looking quite distressed.

She was tearfully sad, fearing that Real Madrid would take all of Arsenal's players.

"Don't worry, I have no intention of leaving."

At my reassurance, Monica, who was sniffling, nodded and hugged me tightly.

The confident Monica who had been proud of Arsenal’s recent success had suddenly become a bit clingy.

The next day.

In the training ground, Bernard Party let out a deep sigh and seemed unable to focus on training.

He still seemed indecisive.

On the other hand, Marco Torreira remained unchanged.

It seemed he had made up his mind.

Our coach was contemplating various ways to fill the potential gaps left by these two players.

There didn't seem to be any clear solution, but rumors suggested that a significant signing was being prepared.

Indeed... if they sold the two players to Real Madrid at a high price and didn’t bring in a high-profile midfielder, the fans would revolt.

The problem was that it was hard to find a suitable central midfielder in the current transfer market.

Any decent player was incredibly expensive, and lowering the standards meant ending up with players with lower potential than the two.

“Hey, doesn’t the coach’s hairline seem to be receding a bit?”

“Yeah, it does.”

Lorenzo’s comment made me realize.

Our coach, whose hairline had been holding strong due to recent good performances, was now starting to recede again.

I decided I shouldn't become a coach in the future.

For men, hair is more important than reputation.

Isn't there a saying?

Men in their 20s and 30s fight with money.

In their 30s and 40s, they fight with honor.

In their 50s and 60s, they fight with hair.

Where did I hear this?

My dad said it after hearing our bald neighbor, Mr. Jincheol, lamenting.

Anyway.

Leaving behind the somewhat unsettled atmosphere of the training ground, the day of the Premier League Round 21 match against Liverpool finally arrived.

We arrived in Liverpool, Merseyside for the away game and soon took a bus to Anfield.

Anfield, the hell for away teams.

A tough match was already anticipated.

In the psychologically hostile away team locker room, our coach said that today's goal was a draw.

Perhaps due to the overall team form starting to decline, the defense was showing signs of instability.

Liverpool surely knew about it too.

The players entering the locker room wore determined expressions.

They seemed to realize that the outcome of this match would significantly impact the league title race later on.

Indeed... there was a 22-point gap between us and 3rd place Manchester United, but only a 6-point gap with 2nd place Liverpool.

A loss here would increase the likelihood of losing the top spot later.

It was a 6-point match, and the Kop's chants filling Anfield were exceptionally harsh and loud.

Time to enter the field.

The players leaving the locker room seemed slightly more tense than usual.

It seemed the same for the Liverpool players.

This match was their last chance to break Arsenal's unbeaten streak and move closer to the league title.

"That guy is Kashan, right?"

"Yeah, the one who scored over 20 goals every season at Juventus and Atletico Madrid."

"Scary."

Listening to our defenders' conversation, I slowly started entering the field.

Glancing at the Liverpool players, they too seemed to be gathering their focus with slightly tense expressions.

The famous Liverpool anthem.

'You'll never walk alone' resonating through Anfield was indeed the hell for away teams.

But what could we do?

We had to try our best to win.

Shaking hands with Liverpool players, I memorized their faces one by one.

They were undoubtedly good players.

But I didn't want to lose today.

Having won in Serie A, I wanted to win the league title in the EPL too.

* * *

-A big match is upon us!

-Yes, it's the showdown between Arsenal and Liverpool! The top two teams in the league meet today at Anfield!

Liverpool had prepared thoroughly for today's match.

It was indeed a 6-point match.

Liverpool, sitting in 2nd place, had filled their vacant forward position with Kashan Vlahovic and were fully prepared.

Although Arsenal was undoubtedly a great team, their defense couldn't be said to be as solid as Liverpool's.

Having consistently conceded goals, Arsenal had the most goals conceded among the top three teams.

Liverpool aimed to exploit that.

'We’re not lacking in attacking prowess either.'

Coach Jurgen Klopp nodded with a confident expression, looking at the opposite end.

Seeing Arsenal's much more organized squad compared to last season, he felt that the next season wouldn't be easy either.

Therefore, he had no intention of letting them leave Anfield with a win today.

Liverpool must remain unbeaten at Anfield.

-The teams are evenly matched.

-It's intense, but overall, Liverpool is maintaining the upper hand and continuing their offensive.

As expected, being the home team, Liverpool had the advantage.

Naturally, Arsenal played defensively, aiming to score through counterattacks.

However, Liverpool couldn't push their line too far forward, focusing solely on offense.

Park Minho and Tyler Smith Rowe were ready to run on the flanks for counterattacks.

"Mino..."

A dangerous player.

A player who possessed all the strengths an attacker should have.

Except for aerial duels, Park Minho had no weaknesses.

Naturally, Liverpool had prepared extensively to stop Park Minho, analyzing him thoroughly.

Now, all that was left was to see the results.

-The ball is passed to Mino!

-After focusing on defense for the first 15 minutes, Arsenal's first counterattack begins!

As soon as Park Minho received the ball, Liverpool's defenders tensed up and started to move quickly.

Simultaneously, Liverpool's players began to block the positions where Minho could pass.

But Minho chose to dribble forward.

-Mino! Dribbling and sprinting with the ball!

-Michael Robertson quickly follows Mino!

-Mino easily gets past Michael Robertson!

Of course, the result was Minho's victory.

However, Lorenzo Lupo missed the low cross, ending Arsenal's counterattack disappointingly.

-Ah! Lorenzo Lupo seems to be heavy-footed today! He misses this great opportunity!

-But Arsenal's counterattack was sharp!

It was just one counterattack.

But it made Liverpool's hearts skip a beat.

"Indeed, it's not easy."

Coach Jurgen Klopp frowned.

Despite successfully defending, he looked at Michael Robertson, who had allowed Minho to dribble past him so easily.

"Is Michael not enough?"

However, there was no better defender on the left side than Michael Robertson in Liverpool.

In fact, there were very few left-backs in the EPL better than Michael Robertson.

The only consolation was that Arsenal was struggling to connect the ball to Minho easily.

Midfielders Navi Keita and Richard Ward Prowse had almost perfectly locked down Arsenal's midfield.

Additionally, Kashan Vlahovic, whom Liverpool had brought in with a hefty fee from Atletico Madrid, was relentlessly aiming for Arsenal's net.

Given enough time, it was clear that Liverpool would score first.

-Kashaaaaaan! Shooooots!

-Oh! Marlon Ramsdaaaaaale! A fantastic save!

-Kashan Vlahovic, who consistently scored over 20 goals every season from Juventus to Atletico Madrid, continues to shine at Liverpool!

Arsenal was shaking precariously.

The Kop at Anfield cheered loudly as Liverpool dominated and pressed Arsenal throughout the first half.

However, as time passed, Coach Jurgen Klopp's expression gradually hardened.

And when Arsenal got another counterattack opportunity a little over 30 minutes into the first half, he stood up from his seat in anxiety.

It was undoubtedly a favorable match for Liverpool.

But every time Park Minho got the ball, Coach Jurgen Klopp had to stand up.

Tap-tap.

Minho slowly dribbled the ball forward.

As soon as Michael Robertson, who was marking him, showed a gap, Minho sharply dribbled and broke through Liverpool's flank.

"Stop him!"

At the shout of Kyle van Dijk, Michael Robertson quickly chased Minho, gritting his teeth and extending his leg.

The problem was that the tackle was quite deep.

And Minho was not the kind of player to miss such a mistake.

Minho lost his balance and fell on the field.

The referee, of course, clearly saw the incident.

Beeep!

The referee blew the whistle and quickly ran over to the two players.

Then, he pulled out a yellow card.

-Ah! Liverpool commits a foul in a dangerous position!

-It's quite a close-range free-kick!

A free-kick chance from an unfavorable position.

Seeing this, Coach Jurgen Klopp frowned and muttered that it was dangerous.
