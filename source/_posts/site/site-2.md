## 1. If You Don't Like It, Do It Yourself! (2)

Alain Lavin.

A soccer coach from France.

Before joining Parma Calcio 1913, he achieved decent results with SC Bastia in the French second division and led the team to promotion. Now, he was starting a new challenge in Parma, Italy.

The team atmosphere was worse than expected after being relegated from Serie A.

He felt the need for a veteran to stabilize the team.

Luckily, or maybe thanks to the club’s management skills, they were able to bring in a legend of the club and one of the top three goalkeepers in Italian history.

Yes, it was Giovanni Buffon on a free transfer.

Thanks to that, the team atmosphere quickly improved.

But that wasn't the only problem.

The squad was relatively large.

However, there were fewer key players than expected.

With Giovanni as the goalkeeper, Alain Lavin needed to bolster the attack. He brought in Gennaro Tatis, who was a burden in Napoli, on loan with a permanent transfer option.

Now, he had a different type of striker to pair with the main striker, Gianluca Inglese.

"Good, with the strikers set... Now, the midfield is next."

Fortunately, Parma's midfield was relatively deep.

The problem was that there was no attacking midfielder suitable for his 3-3-1-3 formation.

So, he and the scouting team pulled all-nighters looking for an attacking midfielder.

Finally, he filled the position by signing Santiago Brunetta from Godoy Cruz in the Argentine league and bringing Sergio Bernabe on loan from Manchester City.

Yes, it was a perfect transfer market.

Then came the preseason.

Alain Lavin couldn't help but hold his head in pain when he saw Santiago had gained weight up to 90kg.

Santiago said he could quickly lose the weight before the regular season started.

Honestly, Alain Lavin didn't have high expectations.

But he decided to give him a chance just in case.

Moreover, he noticed that other players were not in as good shape as expected during training.

Coach Alain Lavin felt a throbbing headache watching the Parma squad, which was different from Bastia.

"Okay, let's sort everything out in the preseason... There's still plenty of time."

Then came the first friendly match of the preseason. Alain Lavin became extremely irritated due to the unilateral actions of the front office.

"What do you mean by that all of a sudden?"

"I'm sorry. But the event was already announced on SNS a while ago..."

Sitting fans on the bench during an important preseason friendly match?

He thought the Parma management was crazy.

But he couldn't argue.

The event had already been announced, and the winners were already touring the locker room and heading to the bench.

"Please notify me of such events in advance next time."

"I'm really sorry, Coach. It won't happen again. I promise."

He had to be thankful they didn't show the locker room before the match.

Coach Alain Lavin felt frustrated.

He felt alone in the club called 'Parma.'

Still, he composed himself and boosted the players' morale.

The match against Cosenza began.

Fortunately, unlike in training, the players moved according to Coach Alain Lavin's tactics.

Thanks to that, Parma dominated Cosenza from the start, creating many good chances.

But.

That was it.

The match started to go wrong from the moment Santiago Brunetta, in the crucial attacking midfielder position, made a ridiculous shot.

Around this time, he could hear the murmurs of a fan who won the event.

"Ah... You can't shoot like that."

Under normal circumstances, he would have ignored it.

He thought the same thing.

"Yeah, that shot was poorly executed."

But as Santiago continued to perform poorly and the Parma players made frustrating choices, the fan's comments became more specific.

"Did he really need to pass into that space? That pass doesn't fit the coach's tactics..."

"Wow, even a passing dog could score that goal..."

"That was terrible. Of course, the shot would go high if you hit it like that."

"Move like that, and you can't complain if the coach slaps you later."

It was infuriating.

So infuriating.

If he hadn't learned Italian, he wouldn't have understood those words.

If they were wrong, he could have dismissed them as, "What does a layperson know about professional soccer?"

The problem was he understood the fan’s words.

And the fan was right.

Moreover, the tactical advice directed at the players was so accurate that Coach Alain Lavin couldn't help but nod his head.

That's why it was so infuriating.

He couldn't argue because the fan was right.

And that wasn't the end.

Santiago Brunetta's poor performance, critical in his tactics, also played a part.

A performance from a 90kg body was bound to be poor.

Santiago had missed several good chances, which made Coach Alain Lavin's face even more grim.

He couldn't help but get angrier.

Then, in the 44th minute of the first half, they conceded the opening goal.

One counterattack.

One cross.

One header.

Yes, Cosenza's opening goal from just one chance left Coach Alain Lavin feeling even more frustrated.

He pulled his tie roughly, thinking about how to instill a fighting spirit in the players during halftime.

At that moment, he heard the fan's comments again from behind.

"No, that's not how you play soccer..."

He couldn't hold back his anger anymore.

"Shut up, you bastard! Then you try playing!"

* * *

Halftime.

I followed Coach Alain Lavin, whose face was as red as a persimmon, into Parma's locker room.

He yelled at a nearby staff member to "Bring a spare uniform!" and the startled staff quickly brought a uniform with the number 44 on it.

"Put it on."

Sure, my advice might have been a bit annoying... but was this really something to get so angry about?

Still, it wasn’t all bad.

Honestly, I was a bit excited.

It was a great opportunity to experience what a professional game was like.

As soon as I changed into the uniform, the players entered the locker room, looking bewildered.

A spectator wearing a uniform must have made them think it was like a Truman Show.

Moreover, the coach, displeased with their first-half performance, immediately grabbed their attention with harsh words.

"Everyone shut up and sit down!"

"Don't move! Focus!"

"Sit down! Don't talk and sit down!"

The locker room atmosphere turned icy cold.

Only then did Coach Alain Lavin calmly list Parma's mistakes from the first half.

"It was terrible. With six players in the penalty area, why didn’t you think of distributing the ball wide? Didn't I explain to use the half-space created by spreading wide?"

"Dennis! Move wider! Wider!"

He even directly criticized Santiago Brunetta, who had the worst performance today.

"I don't need someone in my team who can't manage himself. I'd rather put a spectator in your place."

"What?"

"I don't need a pig in my team. So get out!"

Hearing this, Santiago clenched his teeth, smashed the locker room trash can, and stormed out.

But the coach didn't just throw out complaints.

Indeed, he was different from other soccer coaches.

After scolding the players harshly, he made eye contact with them and reminded them of the good parts of the first half.

Then he looked at me and said.

"You'll take the fat guy's place. Just go in and move around freely."

Leaving those words, the coach left the locker room.

Feeling awkward, I was relieved when the assistant coach came over to check on me.

"What's your name?"

"I'm Park Minho. My Italian friends call me 'Mino.'"

"I see. Mino! You'll play for about 15 minutes."

"What?"

"You saw Santiago's body... The coach is giving him a shock treatment."

Only then did I understand the situation.

The story of how Coach Guus Hiddink once set his watch a minute fast to reprimand the lazy genius Romário came to mind.

He scolded Romário for always showing up on time and even excluded him from the lineup to give him a shock.

It seemed Santiago was also a lazy genius.

"So... the coach created this scene to warn Santiago?"

"Also, he was a bit angry about the comments you made from behind."

That was a bit too much. 

But I understood the situation roughly.

The coach had orchestrated this scene to warn Santiago.

And to scold the annoying fan who was giving unsolicited advice from behind.

Thanks to that, I was making my professional debut in 25 years of my life.

Though it was just a friendly match.

Wearing the uniform with the number 44 and my soccer shoes, I felt like a real professional.

As I entered the field, Cosenza's players were also coming onto the field.

They looked curiously at the strange Asian guy replacing the Argentine pig.

Recalling where Santiago played in the first half, I headed to that position.

The vice-captain of Parma, Gianluca Inglese, patted my shoulder and smiled brightly.

"I heard everything from the coach. Don’t be too scared. Just think of it as experiencing 15 minutes as a professional."

"Sure."

Six players were substituted at halftime.

I was one of them.

Roberto, sitting on the bench, had his mouth wide open in shock as he saw me in the uniform on the field.

Oh, he's drooling.

Looking at the Cosenza players on the opposite side, I roughly guessed the tactical movements the coach had demanded from the players in the first half.

If I moved accordingly, I wouldn’t embarrass myself.

Beep!

The referee's whistle blew.

The second half started.

* * *

Santiago Brunetta is a good player.

If he could just get rid of his lazy and self-centered attitude, he could be like Totti of AS Roma.

Knowing this, Alain Lavin watched him even when he showed up weighing 90kg.

However, he was unfaithful in training and arrogant, relying solely on his talent.

Honestly, in his tactics, the attacking midfielder didn't need a lot of stamina, so Santiago's weight wasn't a major issue.

"As long as he connects clean passes to the wide wingers, he won’t be a burden to the team."

But Santiago was arrogant.

He loved his talent too much.

Maybe that’s why, in this friendly match, he was greedy in good chances.

If he had calmly played the ball, they would have ended the first half with a 2-1 lead instead of trailing 1-0.

He wanted to warn that arrogant genius.

He was a good player who could change with a little motivation.

As he finished his words in a fit of anger at the end of the first half, a good idea popped into his head.

A way to warn both Parma's management, who organized the event without informing the coach, and the arrogant genius.

"Just put that fan on the field."

Luckily, due to COVID-19, they didn’t need to register players for the preseason.

He decided to use this situation.

Thinking about the troublemaker fan and Santiago, who would be criticized and kicked out of the locker room, Coach Alain Lavin prayed to the soccer gods.

May this shock treatment yield good results for everyone.

Beep!

The second half began.

Nothing different from the first half.

Today's friendly was to check how the players moved according to his tactical plan.

So, he could send that annoying fan onto the field.

"Will it be okay?"

"Who are you talking about?"

"Santiago."

"Pray that it will be. But I believe in him. He has a strong competitive spirit. He'll come back in good shape for the next game."

"That would be good, but..."

"Trust me. Honestly, if we don’t do this, we'll be at Santiago's mercy all season. It's better to use this drastic measure in the preseason."

Hearing this, the assistant coach nodded.

"Then, as long as the score stays 1-0 during the 15 minutes that Asian guy is on the field, it’ll be fine."

"Yes, show Santiago that his performance is no different from an ordinary person’s. And then show him Sergio’s performance to warn him."

"Maybe your position could be taken by Sergio Bernabe, who’s on loan from Manchester City?"

"Yes."

Coach Alain Lavin nodded at the assistant coach's words.

The performance would be similar to the first half.

Having an ordinary person on the field wouldn’t significantly affect their defense.

And the role he assigned to the attacking midfielder was the starting point for counterattacks and attacks.

"For 15 minutes in the second half, they'll sit back... There won’t be a big problem. After that, I'll show Sergio's performance and warn him. Santiago will think."

To give up.

Or to change.

Honestly, he hoped Santiago would change.

No, he had to change.

And he would shake hands warmly with the changed Santiago.

Another great story would be added to the legend of Coach Alain Lavin.

"Hehehe."

Just thinking about it made him laugh. Coach Alain Lavin was startled by the loud cheers from the fans.

-Wowwwwwwwwwwwwww!

"Did we concede again?"

But that wasn’t the case.

Looking at the field in confusion, he saw the scoreboard showing 1-1.

And he saw the ordinary fan, Park Minho, celebrating with open arms.

"What on earth is happening?" he muttered in disbelief.
