## 2. Isn't This Basic? (1)

Leo Carpentieri.

He is a good agent.

Because he moves for the players.

Some agents sometimes harm players by being swayed by the influence of big clubs.

But he wasn't like that.

He had the guts to permanently sever ties with some clubs for the sake of the players.

In that sense, he was one of the few good agents who really focused on the players.

That's why, even though his agency was small, all the clients he managed were players of nearly world-class caliber.

Of course, this wasn't all positive.

Being a small agency with only big names means there are few mid-level players to support the backbone of the agency.

As a result, there were slight financial crises.

Of course, they got through it well now.

Anyway.

His dream wasn't to become the best agent.

His dream was to create the second Lionel Messi with his own hands.

Of course, it's not an easy dream.

It might be a dream he can't achieve even in his entire lifetime.

Still, he lived with that dream.

Up until now.

"Leo! What's this show again?"

To the question from his friend, Giovanni Villajo, a scout active at Juventus, Leo responded with a smile.

"A friend who I like has appeared."

"Really?"

"If you watched the video, you'd know. The marketability of this friend."

A pro is a product.

That's what Leo thought.

And Park Minho could be said to be an attractive product that each club could take a chance on without significant loss.

But that's not enough.

"No matter how much of a product he is... he's a client to me."

So, he needed to make that attractive product appeal to the "audience," who are the clients.

For the benefit of the clients.

That's why he arranged this.

"The target is a mid-upper team in Serie B. Minho could perform well enough in a team of that level."

He was confident.

He was confident he could get Minho into the team he wanted as long as Minho showed even 80% of his talent.

"The best would be Parma, though."

Currently, they wanted Park Minho the most.

Their marketing synergy was better than any other team.

And they had a coach who could tactically utilize Park Minho, who lacked stamina.

"And my job is to make those teams have a panic buy."

It wouldn't be easy.

Even though the clubs were in Serie B.

They were very meticulous in recruiting players, just like prestigious clubs.

"The tryout begins now."

At the cry of the hired instructor, Leo looked at the field.

The start was a physical test.

* * *

I heard that this tryout would last a total of two days.

At first, we did a light warm-up by jogging around the field four times to loosen up.

And the first was the physical test.

Zigzag running.

We ran twice in total.

Starting, we zigzagged between cones and reached the finish line as quickly as possible.

"Speed is not very important. Think about your form and run. This is a test to see the balance of your upper body moving side to side and your lower body supporting it."

Nodding and getting into position, the instructor soon blew the whistle loudly.

Beep!

It wasn't a particularly satisfying run.

The instructor just said, "Good! Good! Very good." while watching me run.

Whether I was doing well.

Or if I was a mess, I didn't know.

The second was a light pass & move test.

It seemed like they put in individual skill tests in between physical tests.

I don't know why.

Leo said it was to see if we could maintain concentration after some physical exhaustion, but honestly, I don't know.

Besides me, a few players from other agencies who were told this was a good opportunity were also testing with me.

They did receive passes well.

They asked what type of pass I wanted or how I preferred the ball to flow, but they were too stiff to answer properly in front of the scouts.

Still, I made the passes easy for them to receive, so at least I wouldn't get a zero.

Next was a short sprint.

They said not to think about balance and just run fast.

The speed wasn't bad.

Next was a pass game.

It was a 4 vs. 4 vs. 4 pass game where three teams of four moved, one team defending and the other two attacking.

Our team lightly succeeded in five passes and didn't do bad in defense.

Of course, I, who wasn't in great stamina, wasn't very active in defense, so I might have gotten a bad evaluation.

Next was a shuttle run.

I was last in this.

I realized.

I really lack stamina.

And the last test was shooting.

After receiving the ball from the instructor, I took a one-touch and then shot right away.

This also took quite a bit of stamina.

I shot 20 times in total... Honestly, it wasn't satisfying.

Although all of them went in, the accuracy of my shots dropped significantly in the latter half as my stamina wore out.

Maybe it was because I did some heading in the middle, but I was very tired.

That's how the first day's test ended.

Leo smiled satisfactorily and gave a thumbs-up... but honestly, I wasn't satisfied.

"Your expression doesn't look good."

"Yes, it wasn't as good as usual."

To my answer, Leo made a puzzled expression.

Huh? Why?

Did I make a mistake?

"Do you mean that your condition wasn't as good as usual?"

"Yes, I don't know if it's because I was tired, but my concentration and accuracy dropped a lot."

"That much...?"

Leo seemed quite surprised.

I don't know why, but anyway.

Leo said.

Originally, tryouts usually take from a week to two weeks for testing.

But this time, since the preseason had started and some time had passed, scouts were busy.

And since I was the only one to be checked in this test, it was only two days.

Anyway.

The first day's test was a bit unsatisfactory.

What would the scouts think of me?

Would they think I was lacking?

I was a bit worried.

* * *

"Amazing."

"Honestly, except for the stamina part, he's a decent level player even among pros."

"Usually, players who haven't received systematic training lack in technique... but that guy is totally different."

"Yeah, his movements when receiving passes, the direction of passes, the quality of passes, and the movements before receiving the ball are all top-notch."

"That's not all. When distributing passes, he communicated and tried to lead other players. Players like him usually blend into the team quickly."

At first, they didn't expect much.

They only considered it sufficient if he was marketable.

But Park Minho was different from what they thought.

He was better than expected.

He was physically excellent.

Not only his speed but also his core strength looked decent.

That wasn't the end.

His technique was also outstanding.

Of course, he wasn't a player with only strengths.

"His defense is sloppier than I thought. And his activity level is honestly below standard."

"That's disappointing... If he was born 10 years earlier, he would've been an era-defining attacking midfielder like Kaka or Totti."

Lack of defensive technique and poor activity level.

That held him back.

Some disappointed scouts even closed their notebooks.

But the eyes of some teams were different.

"Stamina can be improved. But his football intelligence or instinctive shooting can't be taught."

"He's a good player. With a little refining, he can definitely become a starter for the team."

A player worth nurturing.

Among them was a scout from Parma.

"There was a reason the coach kept showing interest."

He was a player far superior to Santiago, whom he had personally scouted and brought in.

What Santiago lacked compared to Park Minho was just experience and stamina.

Of course, since Santiago hit 90kg, his stamina was similar to that of Park Minho.

Then the difference between the two was only experience...

"With that talent..."

Experience wasn't a problem.

He gave Park Minho a good score.

A player worth signing.

No, if Santiago continued to struggle and couldn't blend into the team, he would be the top priority to sign.

That was the evaluation of Park Minho.

But there was a problem.

"Cosenza, Benevento, Perugia, and Vicenza all actively talked with Minho's agent."

Not good news.

It meant they were showing genuine interest.

"Anyway, it's just the first day... It's better to judge after seeing the practical test tomorrow."

He thought.

Honestly, if Park Minho's value soared more than expected...

He was considering advising the coach to drop out of this signing.

* * *

The second day of the tryout dawned.

This test was a practical test, starting with a 7 vs. 7 match using half the field, switching between offense and defense.

After this test ended.

We would have lunch and rest, then play a full 11 vs. 11 match for 90 minutes.

Except for a few people who came to help with this test, the rest of the participants were like me, players without a team, and they seemed to consider this opportunity important.

With sharper eyes than the first day, they dribbled to catch the scouts' eyes in the soon-to-start 7 vs. 7 practical test.

They were certainly different.

That's the level you need to become a pro.

Of course, it was only their individual skills that shone.

The disorganized players were obsessed with showing good performance in the test.

Honestly, if I were the coach, I wouldn't pick those guys.

Thud!

After actively asking for a pass and quickly changing direction, the opposing defense collapsed.

But the player who received the ball got greedy and wasted a good opportunity.

"If he had passed to the friend charging into the center, we could have started with an easy goal."

Honestly, I also wanted to run wild.

But if I ran wild while everyone else was running wild, it would really be a mess, so I held back.

I slowly distributed the ball from the center and gave sharp killer passes, so we barely scored one goal.

Honestly, we should have made it 5-0...

Those guys wasted many good opportunities.

That's how the first practical test ended.

The player who showed off his dribbling skills had a satisfied expression... but there wasn't a single scout looking at him.

I saw this with my own eyes.

They completely ignored him.

How do I know? Just... because I could leisurely observe the whole field.

Maybe because there wasn't strong pressure on me, but I could really pass and control the game comfortably.

But why was the opposing marker marking me so poorly?

I heard that guy was a promising defensive midfielder who even started for Ajax when he was doing well...

Honestly, if he had the skills of a pro, shouldn't there be suffocating pressure?

If not, maybe I'm a bit good?

Of course, this is a joke.

There are so many guys in the world better at soccer than me.

Maybe that guy's condition wasn't good either.

I wasn't in great condition yesterday either.

I should rest well and prepare for the next game.

The most important 11 vs. 11 match.
