## 19. The God of Parma (3)

Meeting Higuaín was nothing special.

We had a brief conversation.

Through my conversation with him, I was able to indirectly experience various things.

Leo laughed as he watched me.

While talking with Gonzalo Higuaín, I had a small realization.

I understood why real experience is important.

Of course, Higuaín has a weakness in big games, but I think I figured out why he consistently scored goals until he left Juventus, even when his form was declining.

I also received various pieces of advice.

Especially about the 'turn and go' movement that I still feel awkward with, I got some good advice from Higuaín.

Of course, I would have to practice and fully internalize it.

But just hearing the explanation helped me grasp a bit of it.

Higuaín shook his head, saying he couldn't understand me when I said I kind of got it.

Anyway.

I met David Beckham in the middle and took a photo together.

After a brief greeting with the physical trainer I met at the pre-arranged place after getting some short advice from Higuaín, I moved to the reserved hotel guided by the agency staff.

Watching the sunset outside the hotel, I sent the photo I took with David Beckham to Monica, who would be sleeping by now.

-Monica: What?

-Monica: Suddenly Beckham?

-Monica: Of course, it's Ljungberg over Beckham!

What?

London is about 5 hours ahead of Miami, so it should be her sleeping time now?

-Monica: Minho... Answer quickly!

-Monica: Say, 'A winger is Ljungberg over Beckham.'

-Park Minho: For a striker, Van Persie is the best.

-Monica: Kyaaaa!

After driving away the "malicious Gooner Monica" with Van Persie, I lay on the bed and enjoyed a long-awaited rest.

* * *

A few days later.

The instructor joined us.

To live up to the nickname "The God of Parma" given to me by fans, I trained like crazy.

Starting with the bad habit of having my ankle slightly up when changing direction, causing my body to shake, I quickly corrected the awkward gaze handling when passing.

I also immediately stopped eating the stimulating foods I had been indulging in during my short break and changed my diet to start building my body.

About a week later?

The instructor looked at me and said,

"Perfect."

"I'm still lacking."

"Well... Minho, you might think so, but... In my opinion, Minho is already complete."

"That can't be..."

"If we touch more on the technical aspects here, it might affect Minho's form."

"No way..."

Complete? How can I be complete?

I can't even properly follow the highlights shown on MeTube and end up fumbling.

How can I be considered complete?

"Minho, the fantastic moves shown by players on MeTube are just 'highlights' compiled from those moments."

Uh... Is that so?

I don't think so.

I still feel very lacking.

"Minho, I guarantee... Even without any preparation in the off-season, Minho can score 20 goals in Serie A."

That's too flattering.

Hearing it repeatedly almost makes me feel like a god.

No way... still.

How can I be called perfect?

That's an arrogant expression.

Look at the physical trainer's criticism.

He pushes me to the brink, saying I waste too much energy with unnecessary movements.

At the same time, he increased my stamina training, saying my stamina is still not good enough for a pro.

Yeah, that's training.

But our instructor says I'm perfect.

I'm not satisfied, though.

Even so, he tried to address the areas I thought I was lacking as much as possible.

Of course, he muttered to himself daily with a look of incomprehension.

"Can I improve even more from here?"

Still, he seems competent.

I feel improvements with each piece of advice he gives.

"Your touch is a bit long, right?"

"You received the high ball like a feather... if that's long... No! Yes, it's long! Minho! Let's try to perfect it. Think of the basics."

He kept emphasizing the basics.

He didn't particularly ask me to change anything.

Saying that knowing the basics makes it easier to apply them.

It surely made sense.

"Ah... The shooting is a bit inaccurate."

"If you missed only once out of 30 consecutive shots... Yes! It's still lacking. Let's try to bring out a bit more concentration!"

I was really satisfied.

After the special training in Miami ended.

Our instructor left Miami first, saying he was exhausted.

Later, Leo told me he swore never to work with me again.

"Why?"

I found it quite beneficial.

Why does he hate it so much?

* * *

[Lautaro Valencia signs a 4-year contract with Newcastle!]

[Napoli approaches Dennis Man!]

[Toulouse aims to sign Simon Sop!]

Parma, who achieved an undefeated victory in Serie B, naturally attracted the interest of many clubs.

In the end, core defender Lautaro left, and offers kept coming for other backup players.

But Parma didn't just sell players. They also made gradual signings.

[Parma signs young goalkeeper José Juan from Espanyol for 12 million euros!]

[Parma! Loans young defender Arnau Casas from Barcelona, who couldn't adapt!]

After Buffon's departure, they signed 19-year-old Spanish goalkeeper José Juan to fill the vacant goalkeeper position.

They brought in Arnau Casas, who was forgotten after playing only 2 games for Barcelona, to fill Lautaro Valencia's spot.

Additionally, youth players like Yoan Bozani and Boston Bartok joined the first team like Kenez.

Now, only a backup striker remained to complete the squad Coach Alain Lavagne wanted.

-Roberto: Suddenly the squad is getting very young.

-Roberto: It's a bit worrying.

-KingWangChangJuve: Ah... If our Minho comes to Juve this season, we'll win for sure!

-RealMilan: No, not Juve, but exile, lol

-IHeartMilan: So where is Bianconeri ranked?

-RealMilan: Yeah, 3rd place, lololol

-KingWangChangJuve: ...

As June approached, the list of players who would spend the 22-23 season together seemed complete.

After a brief visit to Korea to see my family, I returned to Parma immediately.

My friend Bbenjiri contacted me.

He said there are 12 players younger than him in the first team.

In a first team of just over 24 players, half were younger than Santiago.

It's a bit worrying.

But with Gianluca and Maryan around, it didn't seem like the team's discipline would fall apart.

Time passed quickly like that.

Monica returned to Paris.

After resting for a few days, I joined the training ground.

June 20th.

Parma's first preseason training began.

* * *

The training ground was filled with familiar faces.

"Minho! How have you been?"

"Wow! What did you do during the off-season?"

"I heard you went to the U.S. and worked out like crazy... Did you really build that body in a month?"

Why are they like this?

Everyone does this much, right?

Answering like this made the players' expressions a bit strange.

"Minho, not everyone can do that."

"Right. You need talent to do that."

Seeing the players suddenly talk about talent, I answered, "You lack effort!" but they didn't seem to listen.

After a proper warm-up, the players gathered.

Looking to the side, half the faces were new.

I understood why Bbenjiri had made such a fuss when I saw the baby-faced players.

They're really kids.

"Baby."

"Are you crazy?"

"No."

Bbenjiri looked at me with a disgusted expression.

No, there are real babies next to me.

So I said, "baby." It's not weird.

"Is everyone here?"

It was the first time seeing the coach since the Coppa Italia final.

Oh, but something is different.

Does he have hair?

Our coach, who had a slight M-shaped bald spot, had more hair than I expected.

When I stared at his forehead, the coach let out a short cough and turned his gaze away.

He got implants.

Oh, he got them.

Wow! Coach looks cool with hair!

Anyway.

The coach started explaining how he would lead us this season.

The tactics were the same as last season.

Tactics centered on 3-4-3.

However, the coach said there would be differences in the details from last season.

Indeed, half of the first team changed.

Some retired.

Some were sold to big clubs.

Some left on free transfers.

On the other hand, the incoming players were just about two, and the rest were almost all youth academy products.

But I wasn't too worried.

I felt it during the morning training.

These kids are better than I thought.

Thud!

"Nice goal!"

"Minho! As expected!"

A 20-year-old forward named Yoan Bozani sensitively scored the pass I made.

His passing is terrible.

His dribbling is slightly above average.

He's a bit slow, and he's weak in physical duels.

But he runs a lot.

Seeing him running more than Kenez, who has monstrous physicality, and moving around tirelessly, I was genuinely surprised.

Moreover, he has a fantastic sense for goals.

He converted all three of my passes into goals, making our coach's face twitch.

What do you call a forward like that?

Yeah, a perfect poacher.

However, he wasn't like Carlos Tevez, who played for Manchester United.

He was a more unique type of player.

At that moment, Gianluca next to me exclaimed and mentioned someone's name.

"Filippo Inzaghi!"

Then I understood what kind of player Yoan Bozani was.

Lacking in all aspects, but runs a lot, has great positioning, and scores goals well.

I instantly understood how to sync up with Yoan Bozani.

Moreover, the new young goalkeeper who joined the team.

José Juan also showed an impressive performance.

Michele Sepe, who is almost confirmed as the first-choice goalkeeper this season, was very nervous.

"Can we really win the Europa League this season?"

It's not just a hollow statement.

It really seemed possible.

* * *

Yoan Bozani.

He was a striker who returned to Parma after being loaned to the Greek league last year.

Though he couldn't play much due to injury in the Greek league, he recorded 12 goals and 1 assist in 21 matches.

It wasn't a bad attacking record.

He had also developed a lot as a player.

He had high hopes.

The results he achieved in the Greek league.

And the situation where Parma's squad had major holes after being promoted to Serie A.

It was the best opportunity for him to get called up to Parma's first team, and as he expected, Parma called him to the first team training ground as soon as he returned.

In the first team training ground, he could see with his own eyes the three forwards who had solidified their positions as regulars.

"The Parma trio who combined for 106 goals last year!"

Kenez Marsetico, the monster who debuted in the second half and scored 22 goals in 19 games.

Gennaro Tattis, who didn't gain much attention overshadowed by Park Minho and Kenez but consistently scored goals and ended the season with an impressive 33 goals.

And finally, a player with many accolades.

Hat-trick in the Coppa Italia final.

Recorded 91 attacking points in a single season.

Contributed significantly to the team's undefeated championship and started to be called "The God of Parma."

"That player is Park Minho."

Yoan Bozani swallowed hard as he realized he had to compete with these three players for a starting position.

But he was confident.

He was sure he could take the spots of Kenez or Gennaro Tattis.

However, during training, the feeling he experienced was more of 'astonishment' than 'competitive spirit' towards the two players.

Thud!

"Stop scoring! Stop!"

Michele Sepe, who had already conceded 8 goals in team training, scolded Yoan Bozani with a tearful face.

But he couldn't help it.

Opportunities that would make him look like an idiot if he missed kept coming his way.

'This player... The God of Parma?'

He got goosebumps.

Perfect passes came at the perfect timing to the positions he envisioned.

Even the top players in the Greek league couldn't read his movements and sent rough passes.

But Park Minho was different.

Thud!

Now he was a bit scared.

Could soccer really be this easy?

He was so scared that it felt easy.

He had already scored 9 goals.

Even though it was just light team training.

With this level of performance, it was natural for the players and staff to take notice of him.

But Yoan Bozani had no time to care about others' gazes.

He was just captivated by the fantastic passes from Park Minho and kept breaking through the B team's defense to take shots.

Thud!

His 10th goal already.

Yoan Bozani thought he could never be satisfied with the rough passes from other players.

At the same time, he realized why that player was called "The God of Parma."

"Park Minho..."

The God of Parma was indeed of a different dimension.
