## 47. Smooth Sailing (1)

Jake Francis is a midfielder.

A versatile midfielder who is almost a hexagon shape.

Of course, the fact that his hexagon is a bit small is a flaw, but the unique personalities of the players positioned in the midfield with him overshadowed his ambiguous abilities.

Initially, there weren't high expectations from the Gunners for Jake, who joined the first team before the season started.

They just thought it would be enough if he showed a decent performance.

However... Jake's growth was faster than expected.

While there are still technical and physical shortcomings, his instantaneous decision-making and football intelligence have increased significantly to cover those.

His excellent stamina, which is considered his strength, combined with decent football sense, brought good synergy.

Thanks to this, after Marco Torreira transferred to Real Madrid, he started to rapidly grow by getting playing time similar to first-team players.

Anyway.

Jake liked Arsenal.

There wasn't a particular reason.

He just liked the red uniform since he was young.

If he had lived in Manchester or Merseyside as a child, he might have joined Liverpool or Man Utd instead of Arsenal.

However, recently, he started to like Arsenal for a different reason.

"Championship..."

His first career championship.

Although it was just the League Cup, Jake was immensely pleased with this first victory.

He achieved a victory that his father couldn't during his active career.

This fact meant a lot to Jake.

Moreover, his respect for Park Minho, who was showing incredible goal-scoring ability at the forefront of Arsenal, accumulated, making it hard for him to leave Arsenal easily.

Despite rumors of several clubs targeting him, he wanted to stay with Arsenal for a long time.

Naturally, Arsenal responded by renewing the contract with the promising young midfielder.

[Jake Francis renews contract! Weekly wage doubled! 5 years with Arsenal!]

Jake was happy.

At the same time, he knew well that more effort was required to maintain this happiness.

"Jake! Don't overdo it."

"He's really happy about the contract renewal, isn't he?"

"Having won the League Cup and with an unbeaten league title in sight in his debut season... it's hard not to be excited."

His teammates smiled at Jake.

Having such a passionate teammate would surely keep the energy up during training.

In the 29th round league match against Brighton, Jake Francis recorded two assists and was named MoM for the first time in a while.

A game that went smoothly.

Jake Francis could be sure that Arsenal had truly gained momentum.

And the first leg of the Europa League Round of 16.

Jake and Arsenal headed to Vodafone Park in Istanbul, Turkey, for the away match against Besiktas.

* * *

Having won the League Cup, Arsenal continued the season smoothly as if riding a tailwind.

The first reason for this smooth sailing was the newfound leeway in the tight schedule, eliminating the reason for physical fatigue.

The second reason was that the specter of injuries, which had plagued Arsenal every season, was relatively quiet this season.

Monica texted me, "Score 10 goals against Besiktas!"

She seemed extremely happy, but sometimes I felt flustered as if Monica thought of me as some kind of 'god.'

"What? Your girlfriend asked you to score 10 goals?"

"Yeah."

Bruno asked with a puzzled look.

"Why can't you score 10 goals? Minho is a god."

"I'm human too."

I momentarily forgot that this guy was also a bit extreme.

I couldn't understand how such a guy was called a genius midfielder of AC Milan or Arsenal.

Istanbul had a peculiar feeling.

Something like... the harmony of the East and West... honestly, for someone like me who stays cooped up in a hotel, both London and Istanbul were just cities.

Well, maybe London was a bit better?

As soon as we arrived in Istanbul, the media buzzed with transfer rumors about an 18-year-old fullback named Erdinko Ibis playing for Besiktas.

This young Turkish player, who debuted at Besiktas this year, had already received offers from several prestigious clubs like Arsenal, Man Utd, Liverpool, Valencia, Sevilla, Dortmund, and more.

I vaguely knew about this guy from my agent, Leo.

Anyway.

There's no need to worry too much about his transfer.

If Arsenal's scouting team deems him worth signing, they'll move; if not... we'll see him playing for another team.

But he wouldn't be bad for our team.

[Erdinko Ibis: "Minho is an amazing player! I want to leave a deep impression on him in this Europa League!"]

He seemed to have a very good personality.

* * *

Away games are always tiring.

Moreover, the particularly tough away matches in Turkey are the type Arsenal really dislikes.

The noisy chatter of the away fans.

Besiktas home fans in striped uniforms energetically cheered in Turkish.

Is it a special day or something?

It was puzzling to see them singing their chants almost desperately, but I understood after hearing from our backup goalkeeper, Jere Granlund, who had experience playing in Turkey.

"They're just... always like this."

"Really?"

"Among the Turkish teams, Besiktas is especially rough. Riots often break out, making it the team you least want to visit."

Despite their rough nature, Besiktas' official supporters, "Carsi," surprisingly oppose racism, fascism, and sexism.

They lead protests, showing a proactive side in demonstrations, and when they get particularly fired up, their fans' cheers can reach up to 130 decibels.

"Wooooaaahhh!"

"Besiktas! Besiktas! Besiktas!"

As soon as we stepped onto the field, the tremendous cheers of the home fans fiercely shook our eardrums.

Unlike the quiet atmosphere of Emirates Stadium, Vodafone Park was almost ablaze with passionate support.

The game began like that.

Today, I started on the bench.

We prepared a 1.5 team, while Besiktas fielded their full squad, seemingly pouring everything into this Europa League.

Erdinko Ibis, whom Besiktas has been promoting lately, was defending Arsenal's attacks from the left flank.

The first half was led by Arsenal.

However, no goals came, and Besiktas gradually regained their momentum against Arsenal's rather blunt attacks.

Amani Richards often dribbled and shook Besiktas' right flank, but Arsenal's attack line without Park Minho was noticeably underwhelming.

Of course, Besiktas' home fans, seemingly displeased with the first half performance, booed and criticized the players as the first half ended.

"Booooooo!"

"What are you doing? Except for 2-3 players, they're all backups! Why are we losing even with all our starters?"

"If you're a veteran, show some veteran spirit!"

Composed of veterans brought from the top 4 European leagues, Besiktas couldn't achieve satisfactory results until the end of the first half.

The second half continued.

In the 49th minute, Besiktas finally got the chance their home fans had been waiting for.

Beeeeep!

-PK! Penalty kick! The referee has pointed to the spot!

Team White, who allowed the breakthrough of the main striker Alex, conceded a penalty kick with a rough tackle.

As soon as the penalty was awarded, the coach called me, and I quickly got up and started warming up.

Although the Europa League is less important than the league, it's still a competition we can't easily give up.

While I was warming up, Besiktas' penalty kick ended with a save by Marlon Ramsdale.

-Wooooaahhh! Ramsdale! He saves Arsenal! Ramsdale's save here!

-Ahhhhh! Besiktas' home fans are crying out! It was a really great opportunity, you know?

Besiktas missed a perfect chance.

The boos from the home fans grew louder.

With recent poor league performance, the boos felt even harsher.

After fully warming up, I talked with the coach about how to approach the game in the second half.

He told me to lead Arsenal's attack as much as possible from the front line as I replaced Gabriel.

As soon as I stepped onto the field, a pass from Liam Murray landed at my feet.

As soon as I got the ball, two Besiktas defenders quickly closed in on me.

It seemed like they didn't want me to hold onto the ball for long, but unfortunately for them, I didn't plan to hold onto the ball for long either.

I lightly dribbled forward, quickly evading two Besiktas defenders, and Vodafone Park erupted with tremendous boos as if a riot had broken out.

"Booooooo!"

After lightly evading one defender with a McGeady spin, I immediately picked up speed.

"Stop him!"

"He's coming to the left!"

"Block the space in front!"

I could hear the words of the opposing players.

With the beautiful background noise of home fans' boos, I immediately took a shot.

Bang!

Thud!

As soon as the powerful shot hit the net, the home fans' screams filled the entire stadium.

"Minhoooooooo!"

"You crazy guy! You're really crazy!"

"Scoring right after coming on as a substitute! You're really amazing, Minho!"

The players ran toward me, who had scored.

It's only natural they'd be happy since I resolved the frustrating situation at once.

Of course, this wasn't the end.

Besiktas is a renowned team in Turkey, but honestly, for someone like me who has faced strong EPL teams, Besiktas' defense, composed of past-their-prime veterans, was a small wall.

I relentlessly pounded on that wall, and Besiktas' old wall quickly crumbled, conceding goals.

-Minhooooooo! Goooooooal!

-Hat-trick! Minho's fantastic hat-trick!

-Scoring 3 goals in 10 minutes after being substituted! Truly amazing!

Monica asked me to score 10 goals.

Honestly, scoring 10 goals in one game is a bit too much to ask.

But I should do my best so that I can at least have a short excuse for Monica later, right?

Besides, Besiktas' prospect, Erdinko Ibis, was staring at me with a blank expression.

Maybe because he was getting beaten so badly, his eyes looked soulless.

Thud!

Then he needs to get hit one more time.

Usually, the more you get hit, the more you learn.

-Minhooooo! That's his fourth goal already!

-Arsenal has quickly widened the gap to 4 goals in the second half!

-Besiktas looks so powerless!

With the score quickly widening to 4-0, Besiktas' players shook their heads in resignation.

But this wasn't the end.

I couldn't be satisfied with just 'goals.'

-Amani Richards! Fantastic gooooal! He scores from Minho's pass!

-The score is now 5-0!

-Dominant! Arsenal is really dominant!

This time I recorded an assist.

Additionally, in the 88th minute, I assisted Bukayo Saka's goal, ending my performance today with 4 goals and 2 assists.

Our coach was smiling brightly, pumping his fist, at my near one-man show performance.

Beeep! Beeeeeep! Beeeeeeep!

As soon as the game ended, red flares burst, and Besiktas' home fans started rioting.

"Oh... my god."

Lorenzo was horrified.

It was like hell on earth.

The stands filled with red flares were a mess with the rampage of furious Besiktas fans.

We hurriedly left Vodafone Park, leaving behind the fans getting beaten by the police and those flipping off the police.
