## 14. The Giant and the Baby Striker (1)

As soon as the final match of January against Cremonese ended, several interview requests came in. 

Apparently, they wanted to write an article about some of the racist remarks made during the game.

Honestly, I didn't feel like it, so I refused.

Unlike me, who was leisurely resting, Parma was going through a rather busy period.

Not only was there my issue with racism.

They were putting everything on the line to renew contracts to keep players before the transfer market closed.

Parma offered contract renewals to players who had performed well in the first half with the money they had saved.

Mostly, the young players were the ones getting the renewals.

They signed the contracts, satisfied with the increased weekly wages the club offered.

It seemed like a big deal had passed.

Unfortunately, a new incident was approaching Parma.

Rather than calling it an 'incident,' I think it's more appropriate to call it an 'accident.'

During training, Giovanni and Santiago collided, causing both to suffer two-week injuries.

With just four days left until the next league match against Perugia.

And ten days until the Coppa Italia quarterfinals against Inter.

Thanks to this, our coach, who had been managing to keep his hair intact with Propecia, seemed to be thinning out these days.

Giovanni's absence wasn't a problem since Michele Sepe, who often rotated to guard the goal, was there.

But Santiago's absence was a big problem.

His replacement was an 18-year-old kid.

His name is 'Keneze Marcetico.'

A very quiet guy from Slovenia.

He never opened his mouth during training.

If I had to describe him...

First of all, he's big.

Big hands and big feet.

198 cm tall and weighs 90 kg.

Despite that, he's pretty fast.

He's also very balanced and agile, catching the attention of the staff at Parma as a promising talent.

The more surprising fact is that he's still growing.

According to assistant coach Matteo, he could grow up to 205 cm...

Then he'd be 24 cm taller than me.

He's like a real utility pole.

However,

His technical skills were seriously lacking.

He often fumbled the ball.

His dribbling wasn't great.

His passing was sloppy.

His shooting was inaccurate.

Just as he has clear strengths,

He also has clear weaknesses as a prospect.

Our coach was deeply pondering.

Bang!

Thud!

Keneze's shot hit the goalpost.

Michele, who dived for the ball, flinched.

If that hits his face, he might get a concussion.

His physical abilities are fantastic.

But his ball-handling skills are sorely lacking.

Morning training ended.

We struggled here and there to learn a new tactic.

It seemed certain that we would use a three-back formation.

The issue was the rest of the formation.

It seemed like a lot would change.

"Hey..."

A voice called out to me.

When I turned my head, the nearly 2-meter-tall giant kid was calling me in awkward Italian.

"What's up?"

"Uh..."

Was he trying to remember his Italian?

Keneze dragged out his words a bit.

Seeing him reminded me of my first year studying in Italy.

I really struggled back then.

Seeing Keneze trying to say something with a frustrated expression, I asked him first in English.

Just in case he spoke English.

Fortunately, he knew some English.

Upon hearing English, his face, which had been stiff like a Moai statue, broke into a bright smile.

A refreshing smile that showed his teeth clearly.

And a nose of an unusual size.

This man's nose... is not ordinary.

"Minho, can I get your autograph?"

"An autograph? Suddenly?"

"I've been watching your games since your debut! I'm really a fan."

Contrary to his taciturn impression, just by looking at his face, I could tell what he was thinking.

This guy.

He's really my fan.

"Sure, anytime."

Come to think of it, this might be my first autograph in a while.

Parma fans oddly kept their distance from me.

It felt like they revered me as some kind of deity rather than as a player they admired.

I took the paper and pen he handed me and left a cool autograph, making him extremely happy.

He felt very different from my first impression of him.

Keneze, holding my autograph, immediately placed the signed paper into a small frame he had prepared, as if he had obtained a treasure.

Do kids these days carry around frames?

It's kind of surprising.

* * *

Our coach finally made a decision.

The new formation was a 3-4-3.

The three-top would be formed around me, Keneze, and Gennaro.

We would build up play from the center using strong pressing and short passes.

Of course, it's not just about short passes.

We have a nearly 2-meter giant.

The two wingers placed on the flanks would deliver long, high crosses to the center if needed.

Experiencing this in practice matches,

I understood why EPL managers still use the big and small combination when forming a two-top.

Keneze wins headers.

He also shields and passes.

He even helps with defense instead of me.

That wasn't all. With Franco placed in the third line, our play became more relaxed.

With Marian protecting him, he was very free from the opponent's pressing.

The downside was,

When attacking, everyone except one defender crosses the halfway line.

Our coach seemed to have already decided.

Let's push through like this.

Our coach shouted, spitting,

"If we concede three goals, we score four! If we concede four, we score five!"

We had a national team coach in Korea with a similar logic.

Anyway,

The tactical preparation was carried out thoroughly.

I also focused more on practicing basics and prepared step by step for the next match.

-RealMilan: Please! Please! Santiago, don't come back early! Please, please!

Hyerin was still like that.

When she first heard that Santiago would miss the Inter match due to injury, she acted like the Virgin Mary.

But as the match drew closer, she started to curse, revealing her true colors.

-Roberto: No, Santiago will come back early and score against Inter.

Roberto, a die-hard Parma fan, retorted.

The two of them were in a Cold War-like atmosphere, resembling the US and the Soviet Union in the 80s.

Meanwhile, Serie B's 23rd round.

The match against Perugia was approaching fast.

* * *

"Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!"

As the match drew closer, more and more people started heading to the stadium in Parma city.

They cheered loudly for the team.

Some hardcore fans even lit flares outside the stadium, giving the police a headache.

This was still mild because Parma was on an unbeaten streak.

When they were relegated from Serie A last season, the atmosphere wasn't as bright as it is now.

Several trash cans were smashed.

Streetlights were broken.

They set off fireworks and cursed.

Someone even got assaulted.

Seeing the expressions of Parma fans slowly heading to the stadium, Roberto smiled.

"At least it's brighter than before."

"This?"

His colleague, who came to watch the match with him, looked at the ultras being dragged away by the police with a disgusted expression.

"You call this bright?"

"Of course. This is nothing."

Three consecutive losses and the trash cans would be on fire.

Of course, Roberto kept this to himself.

"If there are any Asian friends around here, they might face racism."

"That's old news."

Roberto's colleague, who knew nothing about football, looked at him with curious eyes.

"By the looks of it, if there was an Asian among them, they'd be racially abused and even assaulted, right?"

At his colleague's words, Roberto pointed somewhere.

There, an Asian person holding a Korean flag was awkwardly being escorted by the ultras.

"Our ace is Korean. So, if anyone commits racism in Parma, the ultras half-kill them. That's what was posted on the community, so no one does such things."

"Oh! Your Korean friend! Is he good?"

At his colleague's question, Roberto smiled.

Good?

He's so good that I'm scared he'll get sold.

At that moment, there was a bit of commotion ahead.

It looked like an idiot who made a racist remark to the Asian holding the Korean flag was being subdued by the ultras and dragged somewhere.

Roberto wished the idiot luck and headed to the stadium.

He was a bit worried since Santiago was out due to injury, but knowing Park Minho, he was sure he'd ease his worries in today's match.

"Do you think your friend will score today?"

At his colleague's question, Roberto answered.

"Well, you can't always score."

But Park Minho is a player who can meet Parma fans' expectations in other ways.

As they walked down the main street, Parma's home stadium soon came into view.

Parma fans, filled with anticipation, wished for another victory to continue their unbeaten streak.

* * *

It's the first time we're using the 3-4-3 formation.

Unlike our coach, who was nervously pacing around the locker room,

Keneze, who was making his professional debut today, was spending time calmly.

Our opponent, Perugia, is 18th in the league, needing a win today to escape the relegation zone.

So they'll probably come at us fiercely today, which makes me a bit worried.

I'll probably end up tasting the grass again.

Honestly, grass juice is very bitter.

Moreover, the absence of the team's core, Giovanni Buffon, amplified the players' anxiety.

Have we ever felt this chaotic in the locker room during recent matches?

I'm a bit worried too.

Fortunately, the vice-captain Gianluca was going around the locker room, taking care of the young players.

I felt a bit twitchy.

Without Santiago, the tension was low.

"Ah, I need someone to mess with."

As if reading my mind, Gennaro muttered to himself. It seemed Gennaro also saw our slacker as a good punching bag.

Indeed... our slacker has a satisfying impact.

Oh, don't get me wrong.

I still buy him his favorite zero cola from time to time.

I'm not a bad guy.

Gennaro, who enjoys messing with our slacker, is the bad guy.

* * *

If Perugia loses this match, they'll fall to 20th place and get more entrenched in the relegation zone.

Their eyes were filled with determination.

We, their opponents, are the top dogs on an unbeaten streak.

Perugia needs a win today to climb to 17th place in the league as the underdogs.

Hmm... This looks like a movie script.

Then am I the final boss?

Maybe that's why, but Perugia's players' eyes and movements were different.

It was clear that Perugia had prepared a lot.

But what can they do?

We also prepared quite a bit.

There's a famous line from an old game.

"You are not prepared."

"What?"

"It's a thing."

Gennaro looked at me like I was a weirdo.

Santiago didn't react like this.

"I miss you! Slacker, please come back soon!"

Whistle!

The referee blew the whistle to start the first half.

At the same time, the home fans' chants filled the field.

Honestly, I was a bit worried.

The opponents were fully prepared.

We were testing out a new tactic with an 18-year-old rookie making his debut.

But,

This was working better than I thought.

- Another high cross goes to Keneze!

- The opponents can't push him away! He's like a tank! Keneze Marcetico wins the ball again!

- And the shot from Mino on the ball that dropped!

- Ah! It's saved by Andrea, the goalkeeper!

While it's good to play through the center,

When a high cross comes from the flank, Keneze knocks it down, and Gennaro and I finish it off.

This is seriously addictive.

It's working so well; it's amazing.

Gennaro also gave a thumbs up to Keneze, who had already won four headers.

If there's a downside?

It's still his ball-handling.

When we try to attack through the center, Keneze often makes disappointing passes.

Still, it's great.

When he wins a high ball and perfectly knocks it down to me, why wouldn't I love it?

It would be foolish not to score.

Thud!

- Gooooooal!

- Mino neatly finishes off the ball knocked down by Keneze, scoring the opening goal just 9 minutes into the first half!

Was football always this easy?

I didn't envy Kevin Davies, who had the nickname 'Big Head.'

Kevin Davies was only 183 cm tall, but our Keneze is nearly 2 meters.

And he's still growing.

Why do I call him our Keneze now?

He's an attacker who recorded an assist as soon as he debuted.

Of course, I have to take care of him.

Who else would?

And the sight of him single-handedly pushing away two players...

Just, the phrase 'natural strength' suits him well.

He shields the ball alone, then passes it forward.

The pass was slightly long, landing perfectly at the opponent's goalkeeper's feet, which was a slight flaw.

But the sight of a tank pushing forward with two players floundering was simply amazing.

Overwhelming physical ability can sometimes overpower technical skills... this is real.

He won the ball again and passed it forward.

Even if he's only good at aerial duels, it's very effective.

- Keneze wins the ball and passes it forward!

- Gennaro! Gennaro! Gennaro Tatis!

- Gooooooal! The second goal comes in just 14 minutes of the first half! This time, it's Gennaro Tatis's goal!

- Parma, using the new 3-4-3 formation, is showing an incredible performance contrary to concerns.

- Keneze Marcetico, who is making his debut today, records two assists quickly! Parma's new attacking option emerges at Ennio Tardini!

Two assists in just 14 minutes of the first half.

Keneze Marcetico.

This guy is really something.

And he's so sweet.

Santiago's early return?

Slacker, just take your time and rest.

Honestly, I don't miss you that much.

- Receiving a pass from Mino, Keneze shoots!

- Gooooooal! With Keneze's powerful shot, the score widens to 3-0 just 20 minutes into the first half!

- The net shook as if it would tear from that powerful shot!

Did I already record 1 goal and 1 assist in today's match?

This is so comfortable; I feel like I can't play as a lone striker or in the second line later.

Wah wah.

I'm a baby striker, Mino.

Mino is a baby.

A 2-meter giant needs to protect me.
