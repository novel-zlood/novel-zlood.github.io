## 29. Arsenal! Did you wait long? (2)

[Parma! 6-3 Victory! One Step Closer to the Coppa Italia Final!]

[Parma Wins the First Leg of the Coppa Italia Semifinals!]

[Despite Scoring 3 Goals, AS Roma Couldn't Stop Parma's 'Ke-Mi' Combination!]

[Coach André Villas-Boas: 'It's My Mistake. Parma Is a Team Close to Winning the Title. We Have to Overturn a 3-Goal Deficit in the Second Leg.']

[Comments]

-Minhoooooooo!

-Can we really win the title this year? Is it true?

-Parma is invincible!

-Watching Parma's games these days makes me happy. I never knew football could be this fun.

-Minho is a god!

The first leg of the Coppa Italia semifinals ended with a complete victory for Parma.

The camera captured the dejected face of coach André Villas-Boas, who was staring at the field in disbelief. Some Italian football fans nodded, saying, "All coaches who face Minho end up with that expression."

Parma, after their victory, played another Serie A match at home, this time against Napoli.

Currently 7th in the league, Napoli was desperate to win to avoid being overtaken by Torino. But with Park Minho and Kennez each recording a goal and an assist, Parma secured a 3-0 victory over Napoli.

The momentum was great.

Anyone could see that Parma's momentum was excellent.

Of course, many teams have crumbled even with such momentum.

But Parma was not one of those teams.

The only factor that could halt such a team was the unwelcome news of injuries.

[Joshua OUT for 7 Days! Sprained During Training!]

Joshua was out for 7 days due to a pectoral muscle sprain.

[Gianluca! Thigh Injury! Out for 2 Weeks!]

The team's oldest player, Gianluca, was out of the rotation for 2 weeks due to a thigh injury.

Despite these setbacks, Parma scored a 5-0 victory over Benevento, who were promoted alongside them, and continued to accumulate points.

Thanks to this, the point gap with 2nd place Inter widened to 13 points, bringing them even closer to the word "championship."

Then came the international break.

Park Minho headed to Korea.

* * *

After coach Pedro, who led the team to the quarterfinals in the World Cup, resigned, the national team coach position was taken over by coach Kim Yonggab, who previously led Guangzhou Evergrande and Sanfrecce Hiroshima.

It wasn't bad for me.

I could feel that the more detailed tiki-taka style, as opposed to coach Pedro's build-up football, suited me better.

However.

It wasn't the same for the other players.

Even Junseo hyung furrowed his brows and said, "I don't understand why we have to play like Barcelona."

Our strength clearly lay in our decent activity level and fast-paced wing resources.

Blending this with coach Pedro's tactics, which aimed to develop attacks from the central build-up, got us to the World Cup quarterfinals.

But.

Coach Kim Yonggab’s tactics simply wanted us to advance with short passes and score, leaving other players feeling frustrated.

I also felt the frustration in such loose parts of the game.

And this frustration was evident in the friendly match against Lebanon.

Despite leading in all indicators, the score was tied at 1-1.

Watching the team struggle in mismatched tactics, coach Kim Yonggab stood with his arms folded.

-Pass to Park Minho!

-Park Minho passes it short to the center!

-Hwang Yoo-hyun shoots! Goooooal!

The winning goal finally came in the 41st minute of the second half.

Hwang Yoo-hyun, who had been out of form since transferring to Dortmund, finally scored.

Fortunately, we managed a 2-1 victory against Lebanon, but to be honest, unlike the team led by coach Pedro, the team under coach Kim Yonggab struggled against the Middle Eastern teams' defensive play.

Winning 2-1 was a relief.

Naturally, the media's atmosphere wasn't great.

[Coach Kim Yonggab: 'The players seemed sluggish, perhaps because they were called up at the end of the season.']

[Coach Kim Yonggab: 'The national team players will soon adapt to my style of football.']

[Coach Kim Yonggab: 'The tactics were not bad.']

In addition, his interviews, filled with comments that would only provoke players, began to stir things up.

It was so frustrating that some players even referred to it as the "resurrection of cartoon football."

Anyway.

After a 1-1 draw against Paraguay, I returned to Parma.

April came quickly, bringing the 29th round of the league.

A match against AS Roma.

With good memories from our previous win in the first leg of the Coppa Italia semifinals, the team's morale was high.

Moreover, this match would see a full rotation of players.

The coach had partly given up on this match.

The points were sufficient, and we had to head to London immediately after the 29th round match.

[Europa League Quarterfinals 1st Leg! Arsenal vs. Parma!]

Finally, the anticipated Europa League quarterfinals arrived.

The match between Parma and Arsenal.

* * *

The match against AS Roma ended in a 2-2 draw.

Given that most key players were rotated, it wasn't a bad result.

Moreover, Alain coach felt more confident about winning the league, with Yoan Bochani and Gennaro Tatis, who hadn't scored recently, finding the net.

Football is unpredictable, but the foundations Parma had built so far were unlikely to crumble overnight.

Anyway.

Parma headed to London.

Unlike Italy, the weather was a bit gloomy, and someone muttered,

"Damn, the weather's shit."

The first impression of London was a cloudy day.

Park Minho packed his things with a calm expression and moved with the team to a hotel near North London.

[Interim Coach Per Mertesacker: 'Arsenal is a strong team. We plan to show a performance that matches that.']

[Interim Coach Per Mertesacker, Who Pulled Arsenal Back Up to 5th Place!]

[Arsenal Wants to Return to the Champions League!]

[Arsenal Needs to Win the Europa League! Can They Beat Parma, Who Are Writing a Fairytale in Serie A?]

Korean football-related media and communities were focused on this Europa League quarterfinal.

It was inevitable since Park Minho was the only Korean active in the Champions League or Europa League.

Moreover, Park Minho was recording far more attacking points at Parma than Shin Junseo, who had a sensational impact at Tottenham in the past.

Korean football fans eagerly awaited the overseas broadcast, especially the broadcaster holding Serie A rights, reportedly screaming with joy.

In this context, the match between Arsenal and Parma.

And with a mini Korea-Japan match added, the interest from the three Northeast Asian countries was enormous.

Especially since Park Minho was very popular in Japan, where Serie A had high popularity, and in China, where they claimed any Asian player as their own.

So much so that people in Japan and China knew more about Park Minho's career than those in Korea.

Naturally, there were some side effects from such immense popularity.

-Why don't we have a player like Park hyung in China?

-It's because those damn Japs steal our players.

-Actually, Park hyung is from the Ban family and a proud descendant of the Chinese nation!

Seeing such extreme reactions from Chinese fans, Korean fans laughed.

-Yeahㅋㅋ Our Minho is from the Miryang Park familyㅋㅋㅋ

-They claim Earth, hanbok, kimchi, and gat as theirs, and now even Park Minhoㅋㅋㅋ Please! Claim 'that virus' as yours tooㅋㅋㅋㅋ So funny.

-You guys don't have Shin Junseo or Park Minho, do you? We doㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

As the interest from the three Northeast Asian countries deepened, the date of the match between Parma and Arsenal approached.

And on the match day.

The morning sun slightly appeared, then disappeared, with rain clouds forming, increasing the possibility of Park Minho's first match in London being a rainy one.

* * *

"It's pouring like crazy."

"Rumor has it that the English are crazy because the weather is always so gloomy."

"I agree with that."

"With such weather, no wonder the food is in that state."

It's raining heavily.

Not enough to stop the match, but players generally dislike playing in wet conditions.

At least, it's better than the wet matches in Italy.

In some fields in Italy, the drainage is so poor that the ground stays waterlogged, creating what we call 'sticky turf.'

But the Premier League is different.

Because it rains so often, the drainage on the turf is excellent.

Compared to Serie A, the turf management is much cleaner.

There are even heating systems installed, so unless there's a heavy snowfall, matches are rarely delayed.

Sometimes, I wonder if my Monica is so obsessed with Arsenal because she grew up in such an environment.

If I had to eat such terrible food and face such gloomy weather every day, I might go a little crazy too.

However, I did find the night views in London quite beautiful.

When I shared my thoughts, Monica said,

-Monica: Sure, the weather in England can be a bit gloomy. But the dry and wet seasons are distinct, so in the dry season during summer, you can see the sun often.

She said summer in England has a different kind of charm.

Reading Monica's text, which seemed to boast about what kind of city London is, I chuckled.

Despite its obviousness, Monica's love for Arsenal was clearly conveyed through her text.

Thus, I became curious.

What kind of team was Arsenal to captivate Monica this much?

Before the match started.

I left a message for Monica saying I loved her and turned off my smartphone.

It was time to focus on the game.

I stepped out of the locker room and stood in the hallway with the team.

On the opposite side, the Arsenal players were waiting for us, and Lorenzo Lupo, whom I hadn't seen in a while, acknowledged me.

"Long time no see, bro."

Responding to Lorenzo Lupo's British-accented English, I replied in English,

"Yeah, you look well."

"Do I?"

With a slightly stiff face, Lorenzo answered in Italian, making me look puzzled.

Lorenzo hadn't been performing well recently in the league, but he was still justifying his paycheck.

Why did he look so grim?

I didn't understand.

But I realized something from Lorenzo's brief comment.

"This team is a mess."

A short, yet loaded statement.

With that, the players from both teams lined up.

Lorenzo had a lot to say but held back, following the Arsenal players out slowly.

Arsenal.

What kind of influence did this team have on the positive and competitive Lorenzo Lupo?

Something... felt off about this team.

It made me curious.

What kind of football did this team play?

* * *

Arsenal is a strong team.

If they weren't, they wouldn't have survived in the "Premier League" jungle for so long, nor would they have climbed up to 5th place in the league this season.

And such performance was evident in the first leg of the Europa League quarterfinals.

Lorenzo Lupo's opening goal in just 10 minutes of the first half.

Arsenal's home fans clenched their fists in celebration.

Lupooooooo!

Unlike Italy, where a new COVID variant kept the crowd small, over half of the seats at Emirates Stadium were filled.

-Arsenal scores the opening goal in the 11th minute of the first half! A very early goal!

-Parma collapses as they allow a shot from Lorenzo Lupo!

The tempo was definitely different.

Compared to the matches in Serie A, Arsenal's dynamic and fast-paced football left Parma's players bewildered.

But only for a moment.

Dynamic and fast-paced football wasn't Arsenal's exclusive domain.

-Minhoooooooo!

-A header! Gooooooal!

-A fantastic header goal! Minho brings the game back to a tie!

With a perfect header, Park Minho brought the game back to a tie, sharing the joy with Parma's players.

A man seated in the VIP section of Emirates Stadium was watching that scene.
