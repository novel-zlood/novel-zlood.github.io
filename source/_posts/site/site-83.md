## 30. Mini Treble! (2)

Leicester City was different from Arsenal.

Although Arsenal was also fast and quick in transitioning between offense and defense, Leicester City displayed a level of speed in their transitions that was truly characteristic of an EPL club.

As a result, Parma was struggling against Leicester City from the beginning of the match.

It wasn't that the opponent was better than Arsenal.

It just felt like a tougher match because the 'discrepancy' caused by the different style of play was shaking the mental state of my teammates.

To be honest, I thought my decision to drop back to the second line was really the right choice.

If I hadn't dropped back to the center, wouldn't we be losing 2-0 instead of being tied at 0-0?

Of course, this was just a hypothesis.

- Leicester City is putting strong pressure on Parma in the first 10 minutes of the match.

- With quick transitions and fast penetration down the flanks, Parma is struggling to properly respond.

Truthfully, we had somewhat anticipated the opponent's quick counterattacks down the flanks, so it wasn't a major problem.

Even though it looked like we were shaken, Parma's young defenders were doing well in blocking Leicester City's experienced attackers.

Except for one player.

- Jamie Vardy! He's fast! How can this player be 36 years old?

- Jamie Vardy, who has scored double-digit goals in the league this season!

- Jamie Vardy breaks through Parma's defense again! Shoots! Gooooal!

- Leicester City scores the first goal at King Power Stadium! The scorer is Leicester City's number 9, Jamie Vardy!

He finally scored.

He's a very experienced man.

And despite being in his mid-thirties, he doesn't seem to be slowing down.

He's truly an amazing player.

But we can't just sit back and take this.

Although Kenneth was isolated within Leicester City's defense, it allowed me to move freely.

Of course, the pressure from the opponent's midfielders was intense.

Wilfred Umtiti, who I often faced in todayâ€™s match, tried to take the ball from my feet with his long, stork-like legs.

'No way!'

I subtly moved my foot to pull the ball back and passed it to the flank before sprinting forward.

- Minho! Easily dodges Wilfred's challenge!

- The ball goes to the flank! Parma starts a counterattack! Santiago spreads wide to the flank!

- Santiago! Passes to the center! Minho receives it! Minho! Dodges one player! Passes to the side! Kenneth shoots!

Wham!

- Gooooal!

- Perfect play! Parma's renowned attack restores the game to a tie!

Kenneth's goal to tie the game.

As I high-fived Kenneth for smoothly handling my pass and headed back to my position, Santiago approached me.

"Minho."

"What?"

"High-five me too."

This guy is like a child.

After giving him a high-five, he looked triumphantly at Leicester City's winger, Peter Barnes.

I wondered why he did that.

Later, he confessed to me that he had a verbal argument about "which winger works better with their striker."

Oh, come on, like a child.

Seriously... this guy is something else.

I have to admit it.

"You're really something."

He grinned at my words.

Yeah, that smile looks good on you.

"Two years left until I challenge Messi's throne. I will become the second Messi."

I take that back.

This guy is just half-crazy.

And oddly half-crazy.

That's my judgment.

Time passed quickly.

Now it's a little over 40 minutes into the first half.

The flow of the game seemed slightly tilted in favor of the home team, Leicester City.

However, it wasn't as if Parma was easily giving in.

How could a team that only concedes against Leicester City make it to the semifinals of the Europa League?

Well, the first half seems to be leaning slightly in favor of Leicester City.

What about Parma?

Just wait and see.

We'll show a different performance in the second half.

The referee's whistle blew.

It meant the first half was over.

The players of both teams slowly headed to the locker room.

I approached Santiago and asked.

"So, how's the flank?"

Santiago, with a confident expression, flashed a bright smile.

"Look forward to the second half. I'll show you the reincarnation of Messi."

* * *

The reincarnation of Messi, my foot.

As soon as the first half ended, Santiago committed a foul in a crucial position, leading to a goal.

- Goooal!

- Jamie Vardy scores a brace!

- Ah! Santiago's defense was too sloppy! Jamie Vardy cleanly finishes the free kick from a very close range!

- The trajectory of the free kick perfectly met Jamie Vardy's foot, completely reversing the trajectory!

Rupert Madison's free kick.

And Jamie Vardy's subsequent breakthrough and shot.

Parma players frowned at the quick goal conceded and glared at Santiago.

But our cheeky guy stood his ground.

After being called up to the Argentina national team during the last international break, he had been frequently mentioning 'Messi' for some reason.

"This is just a minor mistake for the second Messi."

There is something to be said for his self-absorption.

Despite making a terrible mistake that allowed the opponent to lead, his face remained shamelessly calm.

"Messi wouldn't do that."

"The standard will change now. I am Messi."

In response to Joshua's rebuke, cheeky Santiago laughed, looking at us with a face seemingly possessed by Messi.

"I'll show you a god."

Did this guy really take drugs?

It was creepy.

Alright, please show us that great god.

And as expected.

Our Santiago simply dribbled into the center like usual and made a splendid pass.

I received it and perfectly passed it to Kenneth.

We can't just sit back and take it.

If we concede a goal, it's only fair to score one in return.

- Goooal!

- Kenneth scores a brace! And Minho with his second assist! Today, Parma's attack is led by these two players!

A brilliant brace by Kenneth.

Santiago ran over to Kenneth, who gave a thumbs up saying my pass was good.

"How was it? Messi's pass?"

Kenneth replied with a calm expression.

"If you are Messi... then I am Messi with a height of 2 meters, Minho is the Korean Messi, and Joshua is the Messi playing central midfielder."

At those words, cheeky Santiago frowned.

It seemed he finally came to his senses.

I was very curious about who inflated this guy's ego so much.

Still... it wasn't bad.

Even if he's not the real Messi, if self-suggestion can help him maintain his mental state, who cares?

More importantly, I could feel that our players were starting to adapt to Leicester City's tempo.

Unlike the first half, we were gradually increasing our possession, and there were jeers from the home fans sensing a crisis.

Booooooo!

Well, except for those quick counterattacks, honestly, Leicester City and Arsenal feel similar.

Our coach, having observed Robert Rodgers' quick counterattacks throughout the first half, began to respond in the second half, causing Leicester City to quickly crumble.

- Minho! Takes the ball and runs!

After easily dodging Wilfred Umtiti, I used a flip-flap to pass Rupert Madison, who came charging beside me.

- Minho! Dodges two players in an instant!

- This is it! This player is Parma's fantasista 'Park Minho'! A sensational breakthrough!

Eventually, Leicester City's fullback Jimmy Justin hurriedly came out to block my breakthrough.

But seeing Santiago breaking through behind him, he had a look of 'Oops!' on his face.

Tap!

A clean pass.

Santiago, with a confident expression, turned behind Jimmy Justin and penetrated the danger zone.

- Santiago! Succeeds in breaking through!

- Santiago's cutback! Santiago breaks through the center!

"Minho!"

As soon as I heard Santiago's shout after penetrating to the right spot, I moved to a position easy to receive the pass.

A pass accurately delivered to my feet.

Sometimes this guy fails with clumsy passes, but he doesn't make a single mistake in such important matches.

A player with ups and downs being strong in big games.

It felt somewhat paradoxical.

Tap! Tap!

- Whoaaa! Minho! Minho!

After lightly touching the ball and dodging one more player, the only player in front of me was Leicester City's goalkeeper.

I took a shot half a beat faster.

Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel dived, but...

The ball I hit drew a trajectory he didn't expect and shook the net.

- Goooal!

- Minho! Scores his 14th goal in the Europa League, and Parma takes the lead!

- Unlike the first half, Leicester City looks quite powerless in the second half!

- Truly amazing! Minho!

Season's 51st goal.

14th goal in the Europa League.

It felt like I had scored a lot of goals this season.

Someone might ask if I'm not tired of scoring goals... Scoring goals is always exhilarating.

Ah... exhilarating!

* * *

- The game ends!

- Parma wins 3-2 at Leicester City's home ground and returns to Italy!

- Leicester City must be frustrated! The second leg will be at Parma's home ground, where they boast an almost invincible win rate!

The game ended 3-2.

Minho Park, who scored the winning goal, was naturally chosen as Man of the Match.

[Minho Park's One-Man Show! Leads the team to victory with 1 goal and 2 assists!]

[Parma wins the first leg of the Europa League semifinals! Even a draw in the second leg will see them through to the final!]

[Again 1999! Parma aims for their third Europa League trophy!]

[AS Roma defeats Feyenoord 2-0, increasing the likelihood of an all-Serie A final in the Europa League!]

[Parma's fairytale nearing its end! Eight of the starting eleven players are set to transfer after this season!]

[Where will Minho's next destination be?]

Contrary to initial nerves, Parma won the first leg against Leicester City more comfortably than expected.

Although the score was a tight 3-2.

In-depth analysis of the match showed that Leicester City was significantly outmatched by Parma in overall aspects.

Some experts suggested that Leicester City should have made their decisive move in the first half.

Returning to Italy, Parma.

In the match against Spezia on April 30th, a win, coupled with a loss or draw by fourth-place AC Milan in the next round, would secure Parma's Serie A title.

As a result, tickets for the Spezia match sold out quickly despite limited seating due to COVID-19, and some tickets were even being resold at 15 times the original price in Parma city.

- Minho! Scores his 32nd league goal! With today's win, Juventus in second place and Inter in third place are out of the title race!

- If AC Milan, who have one game in hand, lose or draw their next match, Parma will be crowned champions!

- If not, Parma's title confirmation will be postponed to the next match!

Then came the news.

AC Milan defeated Cremonese 3-0.

Parma fans were filled with regret.

However, they did not doubt Parma's eventual triumph.

They were just disappointed that the title was delayed by one match.

"Anyway, if we win the next game, it's confirmed."

"Who's our next opponent?"

"We're up against Udinese. It's a home match too."

"Hahaha! I can see Parma's league title at home? Really? Am I dreaming?"

Fans wore expressions of joy.

At the same time, worry crept in.

"Eight of our starting players are set to transfer after this season."

"It can't be helped. The club has no money..."

"I want to tell them to take out loans to keep all the players... but I'm afraid Parma will go bankrupt again."

"Minho is leaving too... Can we even stay in the league next season?"

Despite Parma's tremendous achievements, the club's finances were severely lacking.

They couldn't keep everyone.

Parma didn't even have the funds to keep Minho Park.

Thus, April, filled with the joys and concerns of fans, ended and May arrived.

The first match of May was the second leg of the Europa League semifinals.

A home match against Leicester City.

Unlike the tight score of the first leg, the second leg saw Leicester City crumble helplessly.

Kenneth scored in the first half.

Minho Park scored in the second half, allowing Parma to smoothly advance to the Europa League final.

The Parma squad was in high spirits.

But that atmosphere quickly turned cold.

Coach Alain got the players' minds straight.

He furiously scolded the players in training, saying they looked like they had already won, and the young players, who were slightly intoxicated by victory, snapped back to reality in shock.

Then came the home match against Udinese on May 7th.

Minho Park performed a show of strength, sending the home fans at Ennio Tardini into a frenzy.

Naturally, it caused a stir in Korea as well.

The Serie A broadcast recorded unprecedented viewership ratings in Korea, making new history.

- Minho! Dribbling quickly with the ball!

- Throughout today's match, Udinese's defense, swayed by Minho, looks disorganized!

- Minho! Easily dodges a defender without any special skills!

Minho Park's number 24 jersey was the only thing visible to those watching the broadcast, showcasing his incredible performance.

"Whoo!"

Minho Park, panting heavily, charged forward.

He effortlessly bypassed another Udinese defender with beautiful ball control and overwhelming speed.

Seeing him sprint nearly 30 meters alone, the home fans at Ennio Tardini roared with ecstatic expressions.

Minhooo!

Park Minho! Minho! Minho!

Our god! Our god!

Parmaaa!

After evading the last defender, Minho Park delicately chipped the ball over the goalkeeper, shaking the net.

Ennio Tardini erupted in a massive cheer akin to an earthquake.

- Minhooo!

- Hat-trick! Minho completes a hat-trick, sealing Parma's victory!

- Just got word! AC Milan draws with Napoli, and if Parma holds on, they will secure the league title!

The thrilling hat-trick, capping the final point for the championship, even caused some spectators to faint.

The match was briefly delayed as a result.

The commentators were amazed, calling it the first match where seven spectators fainted.

Fortunately, all seven fainted spectators were reported to be in good health.

And then.

After all the additional time had passed, the referee slowly blew the final whistle.

Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!

As soon as the match ended, journalists quickly spread the news of Parma's victory worldwide.

[Parma! Writing a fairytale!]

[The underdog who won the Serie A title! How did Parma become a powerhouse?]

[Parma wins the league title with Minho's hat-trick! Only the Coppa Italia and Europa League finals remain!]

[Minho leads the victory with his 35th league goal! Making his name known throughout Italy!]

[Why are scouts from Serie A clubs heading to Korea?]

[Parma fans chant! 'Minho is the god of Parma!']

[Minho is indeed the god of Parma!]

As the news of Parma's victory spread at lightning speed, the fans also stormed the stadium at the speed of light.

"Waaah! It's a victory!"

"Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!"

"Unbelievable! I can't believe it! We're champions? Serie A champions?"

And soon, the fans who stormed the pitch surrounded Minho Park, hoisting him up and cheering.

The god of Parma! Park Minho!

The god of Parma! Park Minho!

The god of Parma! Park Minho!

The fans continued to lift him up as if it would never end.

Minho Park kept soaring high into the sky.

Other players and Coach Alain experienced similar treatment, but an unusually large number of people gathered around Minho Park.

Minho Park thought.

He felt like he was going to throw up from the motion sickness.
