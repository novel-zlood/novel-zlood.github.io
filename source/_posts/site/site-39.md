## 16. Value Surge (3)

Beep! Beeeep! Beeeeeep!

The referee's whistle signaling the end of the match echoed.

A hard-fought draw.

Parma Calcio's home fans breathed a sigh of relief that their unbeaten streak remained intact.

On the other hand, Ascoli, who missed their chance to climb to second place, could only vent their frustration with curses and jeers.

[Comments]

-Lolㅋㅋㅋㅋ That match was insanely funㅋㅋㅋ

-What's Ascoli going to do nowㅋㅋㅋㅋ All teams from 2nd to 6th place have the same 45 pointsㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-The draw in today's match will definitely impact Ascoli a lot.

-Seriously though, Park Minho is crazyㅋㅋㅋ

-Yeah, he didn’t do a lot of dribbling like in the last match against Inter, but he was good.

-His goal-scoring ability was insane!

-I totally agree.

-It felt like Parma was about to give up, but then Minho kept creating chances and finally scored the equalizerㅋㅋㅋ

-His play is definitely different. There's something Parma's other players can't do.

-Bartender! Close the shutters! We’re not going home tonight! Pour some more Korean pride!

The fans' reactions were naturally passionate.

Especially the interest in Park Minho grew even more.

Additionally, stories from some tourists related to Parma emerged, drawing even more attention from Korean overseas football fans to Parma and Park Minho.

Haven't you heard?

Stories of people traveling to see Korean players active in Europe, being asked if they are Korean and receiving a warm welcome.

Of course, there were many stories related to Park Minho as well.

Thanks to this, the community buzzed with 'national pride'.

Naturally, the group chat with Park Minho and his friends was also lively.

Here, it was noisy in a different sense.

-Roberto: Minho... Parma is a great team with tradition and history. Even if they get promoted to Serie A, they deserve to compete with other teams.

-ReallyMilan: So, what's your point?

-Roberto: Hyung! Please stay for just one more year!

-LoveMilan: Lolㅋㅋㅋㅋ It's hilarious hearing an Italian say 'hyung' in Korean.

-Roberto: Does that mean AC Milan is out?

-LoveMilan: Hyung? Call Park Minho 'Professor' properly, Roberto!

A noisy chat room.

After finishing his shower and entering his room, Park Minho looked at the piled-up chat messages with a puzzled expression.

* * *

"What are they doing?"

After showering, there were a lot of chat messages.

Excluding Monica, the four others were fiercely fighting over Park Minho.

Am I some kind of object?

It felt that way.

Well, their interest wasn’t entirely bad.

It’s cute.

I haven't even thought about where to go, but they’re excitedly talking about Inter, AC Milan, Juventus, staying in Parma, etc.

It’s a bit scary that Monica hasn’t said anything though.

Considering she said last time that anywhere but Tottenham is fine and looked dejected, she might have given up knowing that Arsenal is unlikely to recruit me.

Honestly.

Arsenal has been a mess lately.

That guy with the nickname Gabonman missed training for a tattoo and couldn’t play.

Even the main attackers are injured.

And the team didn’t reinforce in the winter.

Monica called me today and mumbled Arsenal's owner's name.

Honestly, it was a bit scary.

If there’s news later about an attack on Arsenal’s owner, there’s a 10% chance Monica might be the culprit?

Of course, that won’t happen.

Leo contacted me.

He said that after watching this match, many teams showed great interest and contacted him.

I wasn’t really thinking about big clubs.

It could be hard to secure a starting position.

More importantly, I prefer leading a mid-high tier team to victory.

Wolves, Leeds, West Ham, Leicester.

I’m interested in such teams.

Isn’t Arsenal a mid-high tier team?

I’m interested in them too.

As I said before, they don’t seem to have the capacity.

Leo said they’re passive about recruiting me.

But don’t they have a lot of money?

What a mysterious club.

-KingWangJjangJuve: Professor Park Minho! I found 10 reasons why you should join Juventus!

-LoveMilan: I found 15 reasons!

-ReallyMilan: Haha, I found 20 reasons! Give upㅋㅋ

Weak.

Too weak.

You guys still have a long way to go.

Last time, Monica uploaded a file in the group chat titled '49 Reasons Why Park Minho Should Go to Arsenal' and the chat room went silent.

A fake cannot beat the real thing.

You rookies.

Come back better prepared.

* * *

As fans' interest surged.

My interest in various clubs also surged.

I know this because there are far more articles about my transfer rumors.

Even when January passed a bit, there were only a few articles, but now there’s a new transfer rumor every day, and sometimes even unbelievable clubs are mentioned.

I think half of them are bogus.

Well, what can you do?

Journalists need to make a living too.

Anyway.

As interest from other clubs surged.

I heard that Parma's management team kept contacting Leo, begging to renew my contract.

They said they would match the highest salary within the club.

They pleaded to raise the buyout clause.

Leo didn’t react negatively.

-If Parma wins the Italian Cup, renewing the contract would be good.

-If you transfer to another team this summer, you'll have to adapt and compete for a starting position.

-If you struggle to adapt and don’t play often...

-It could affect your national team call-ups and you might miss the 2022 World Cup.

It’s a valid opinion.

And that’s not all.

The Europa League qualification gained from winning the Italian Cup was also quite tempting.

Rather than adjusting to new teammates, playing in the Europa League with familiar Parma players could be a great opportunity.

Of course, the condition of Parma winning the Italian Cup is a challenge.

But I didn’t think it was impossible.

Think of the teams we’ve defeated to get here.

We took down AS Roma and Inter.

Now, only Atalanta in the semifinals remains.

And the final against the winner of AC Milan and Lazio.

It’s very possible.

Parma has the ability to achieve that.

So, I plan to watch a bit more.

Leo also advised me.

He told me to consider staying at Parma for now.

As my value rises, my options increase.

But, if I stay at Parma for another year, won’t I face Ascoli again?

That would be problematic.

Oh football goddess!

If you hear my prayer, please make Ascoli fall into a losing streak so they don’t get promoted automatically!

* * *

You can’t always perform well.

You can’t always score goals.

In the 26th round of the league.

In the match against Crotone, I played for 77 minutes and quietly rested on the bench.

The team won 1-0 with Santiago's winning goal.

After the fierce battle with Ascoli, the players were quite relieved, and their performance wasn’t bad.

But it was strangely a match where goals didn’t come easily.

It was a bit disappointing.

But there was good news.

Ascoli fell into a losing streak.

They were now only 2 points ahead of 7th place S.P.A.L., facing a crisis.

It seemed the football goddess heard my prayer.

Anyway.

I didn’t record any attacking points in this match, but our coach welcomed me with a bright smile despite my poor performance.

It felt strange.

Our coach was asking me to perform moderately for about 5 matches.

Well, I didn’t slack off.

After peaking in the match against Inter, I did feel a bit of a decline.

When I asked Matteo, the assistant coach, he said it was normal at this stage due to physical fatigue, and not to worry.

The team doctor also advised that my thigh muscles were accumulating fatigue from playing so much lately, so I should come off the bench in the match against Lecce.

Well, I did run a lot recently, so I thought I needed rest too.

Kenez was very worried about me.

Seeing that, Santiago was somewhat envious.

He was whining about not having a young prospect like me to follow him.

Will that punk ever become a veteran?

If that day comes, it will be a singularity like adding three-pointers in football.

Anyway.

In the next 27th round match against Lecce, I was substituted in at the 30th minute of the second half.

The score was already 4-1.

There wasn’t much time, so I just maintained my form and finished the match.

The MVP of the Lecce match.

The Man of the Match was Denis Man, who scored a hat-trick.

Kenez also scored a goal.

Our attacking squad has been on fire lately.

I need to start recording attacking points again soon.

I’m confident about showing my performance in the next match.

Having been substituted in the last match, I have more physical reserve, so my performance should be better than the last match.

“The next opponent is Atalanta, right?”

“Wow... It’s one challenge after another.”

“Is it?”

I think they’re easier than Inter.

But these friends don't seem to agree.

Isn’t Atalanta that team?

The one that performed well in the Champions League last season.

Known for their aggressive football.

With Coach Gian Piero Gasperini, their offensive power in every match is comparable to Bayern, Man City, and PSG, which makes them a team to be wary of.

But they’re not without weaknesses.

And although they don’t have standout stars.

They have many players coming up through a solid youth system, which our coach envies a lot.

I heard our coach suggested investing more money in the youth facilities to Parma’s management.

Seeing him sigh deeply lately, I guess his suggestion was ignored.

Oh... poor Coach Alain Levagne.

Recently, he’s called ‘Alverji’ in Korea.

I hope he stays strong.

Back to the topic.

Atalanta is definitely a strong team.

Their offensive power is on par with Inter.

But there’s no need to be overly scared.

“Minho, aren’t you afraid of Atalanta? In some aspects, their metrics are better than Inter.”

“But they’re only 5th in the league. We’re the team that beat Inter, the league leaders, so we should be confident.”

At my confident statement, Santiago let out a curious ‘Oh!’.

But I really think there’s no need to be scared.

Who did Parma defeat to get here?

Serie A's number one, Inter.

We’ve also beaten AS Roma.

I never thought we were outmatched against other Serie A teams.

“Instead of worrying, let’s train. Such distracting thoughts come because your body feels comfortable.”

At my words, Santiago flinched and shivered.

Do you dislike training so much?

Look at Kenez.

Focuses back on training at my words.

“Minho always picks on me...”

He pouted as I compared him to Kenez.

Oh dear, seeing this makes me unable to imagine Santiago as a veteran.

“I learned traditional Korean stories!”

“This must be like the tale of the yellow ox and the black ox, right?”

Assistant coach Matteo’s words momentarily left me stunned.

No way, this Italian guy.

How does he know about the story of Hwang Hui and the ox?

Though his analogy is terrible.

It was shocking that an Italian knew a story from the Joseon Dynasty.

Kenez seemed deeply moved by Matteo’s Italian rendition of the story and nodded in agreement.

Then he looked at me and said.

“I like the black ox, Minho.”

No, people aren’t oxen.

“This is driving me crazy.”

I felt a slight headache.

Is this really okay?

* * *

Two consecutive matches without a goal.

As Park Minho remained silent for a while.

A man, who runs a mackerel set meal restaurant, was busy leaving slanderous comments about Park Minho on an overseas football community.

He had recently lost a lot of money on football betting.

His mackerel set meals weren’t selling well.

His YouTube channel’s subscriber growth had also slowed, adding to his stress.

But.

Despite his slander, the community’s focus remained on Park Minho.

Instead, they mocked Baek Seunghun for blaming Park Minho for his gambling losses.

[Title: Hey! Park Minho got injured!]

-Content: Rising star in the four major leagues, 'injured'ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

[Comments]

-ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Our Baek is crying! Stop teasing himㅋㅋㅋ

-Ohㅋㅋㅋㅋ Imagining that football betting addict rushing in is hilariousㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-Seunghun! Fooled again?

The more he was mocked, the more Baek Seunghun continued to slander Park Minho.

Then the discussion shifted to the first leg of the Italian Cup semifinals.

Baek Seunghun seized the moment to use Atalanta to ridicule Park Minho.

[Title: Haha, Park Minho will get crushed by Atalanta.]

-Content: Honestly, Park Minho's real skills will be exposed, and he won’t score like against Interㅋㅋㅋㅋ

[Comments]

-No, he won’tㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-Here we go againㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-You lost 200k on Inter, didn’t you?

-Betting addictㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

The continuous mockery.

Baek Seunghun gritted his teeth.

[Title: If Park Minho scores against Atalanta, I'll jump into the Han River in my underwear!]

As soon as his last post went up in the community.

Park Minho was browsing through the community on his smartphone and saw Baek Seunghun's post.

Park Minho read the post slowly.

He realized that the author, Baek Seunghun, was someone who attended the same middle and high school as him.

Park Minho chuckled.

He felt the stark difference in their current positions.

At the same time, he thought this was a perfect opportunity to forget the past with Baek Seunghun.

“If you want to jump into the Han River that badly...”

Yeah, I’ll make sure you do.

Park Minho nodded with a smile.
