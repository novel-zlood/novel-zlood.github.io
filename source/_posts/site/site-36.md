## 15. Park Minho's That Day (2)

Goran Perisic thought.

Whose fault was the goal we just conceded?

Why did we leave that damn Asian alone?

Upon reflection, no one made a mistake.

Stipe blocked that Minho Park guy's path in a textbook manner.

Pietro made a clean tackle.

Goalkeeper Samir Handanovic definitely moved in response to the opposing striker’s movements.

Lastly, with three of us rushing in to defend, honestly, the players did everything they could.

So, was it the coach’s fault?

It didn’t seem like it.

In terms of tactical movements, it was Inter, not Parma, that was benefiting.

If it weren't for that inexplicable goal just now, Inter would have been overwhelming Parma.

Alright, let's go back to the beginning.

So, whose fault is it?

“It’s no one’s fault.”

Yeah, it’s no one’s fault.

This is... just a goal that the opponent scored well.

So, it made me a bit scared.

If a situation like just now happens again...

Can Inter stop Parma?

- Inter! Unhappy with conceding an early goal in the first half, they are fiercely attacking Parma!

- Parma, unable to gather themselves! But they are persistently defending! Throwing their bodies to maintain a 1-0 lead!

“Don’t let the ball go to No. 24!”

“Let’s possess the ball more! It’s fine to move it slowly! Just be careful of their counterattacks!”

Gino’s voice could be heard.

Goran took the ball and quickly moved up the flank.

As the wing-back advanced high, the center also busily moved to get into position.

Parma left the flanks somewhat unguarded.

That means they don’t mind if we cross.

It’s understandable since there’s a 2-meter giant defending in the penalty area along with the three-back defense. Why should they fear aerial competition?

Goran exhaled deeply.

This must be broken through individual skill.

A cross is out of the question.

But the opponent lured Goran to cross.

Goran didn’t like that part.

‘Damn it.’

There’s no other choice.

A low and whipping cross.

But it was blocked by the head of the 2-meter giant, making the ball Parma’s possession.

Simultaneously, Parma’s counterattack began.

“Minho!”

Hearing the name that made Inter players flinch, the ball was connected long to Minho Park in the front.

* * *

It’s amazing.

My body feels light and...

The ball moves freely.

It’s amazing, so I tried all the individual skills I wanted to try during the game.

Yeah, today might be the day.

I can see the entire field clearly.

My body is light, and my feet are sensitive.

Tap!

Inter knows this well, too. 

As soon as I get the ball, one player rushes to pressure me, and another blocks the passing lanes, trying to make me pass back.

Tap! Tap!

Normally, I would have passed the ball back and asked for it again while moving forward.

But today, there’s no need for that.

I can just break through.

Today, I am almighty.

That means omnipotent.

Now! Two Inter players fall! Hoi!

This really makes them fall.

- Minho! Minho! He dribbles past two players with fantastic moves and breaks into the flank!

- The two players lost their balance in an instant!

- Perfect flip-flap and body feint!

- Santiago, who was on the flank, moves to the center!

- Parma’s counterattack starts again!

- Inter is in danger! It’s very dangerous!

Inter’s wing-back, Goran Perisic, came running fast.

This guy is following my play fairly well today, probably because he’s in good condition.

If my body wasn’t light today... I might have struggled throughout the game.

Tap!

I made a long pass that connected precisely to Santiago, who came to receive it.

Then, I bypassed Goran and asked for a return.

- The ball goes over Goran’s head!

- Santiago returns the ball to Minho! The flank is wide open!

- Inter is in danger!

Inter is indeed a strong team.

Even in such a shaky situation, their three-back line is tight enough to make crossing difficult.

Even if I cross, only Kenese has a good chance to receive it cleanly.

Well... then I’ll just break through again.

“Damn bastard!”

“Does he think he’s Ronaldinho or something?”

I heard rough grumbling from the crowd as I ran on the flank.

But so what?

Today, I feel like I could imitate Ronaldinho, and that makes me a bit scared.

Why am I scared?

I’m scared of this ‘me’ who feels like I can do anything.

...

Was that a bit cringy?

* * *

Tap! Tap!

It seemed like a long thought, but...

My body was already moving.

From the moment Minho Park played with the ball and passed Ricardo Bastoni, Inter’s defense was shattered.

The solid defense fell apart with just a few foot skills, becoming a mess.

And then a pass through the middle.

Ending with a finishing shot.

Beeeeeep!

- Inter breathes a sigh of relief!

- Kenese’s powerful shot hits the goalpost and bounces off!

It was because Kenese received the ball that the shot was inaccurate.

If it had been another player, it would have been 2-0.

Knowing this, Inter’s goalkeeper Samir barked at the defenders like a Chihuahua.

To stick to him more tenaciously.

To stop him even with a foul.

Otherwise, they would really get breached.

But Minho Park was not someone easily stopped.

When Minho Park got the ball, Inter could only shrink back like a turtle in its shell.

Thanks to this, after the 30th minute of the first half, Inter looked like the weaker team.

Parma, on the other hand, looked like the top dog dominating the game.

The only fortunate part was that the first half would soon end, but the downside was that Parma was leading 1-0, forcing Inter to raise their line in the second half.

But if they raise their line, who can perfectly stop Minho Park?

Gino’s face hardened even more.

The whistle blew, signaling the end of the first half.

Gino Inzaghi quickly returned to the locker room to figure out how to turn the game around.

* * *

Ah.

I was a bit stupid.

No, just an idiot.

I got so into the light feeling of my body that I forgot the promise to score a hat-trick.

Halftime.

Entering the locker room, I saw Coach Alain Levagne excitedly walking around among the players, shouting.

“Inter! They’re nothing!”

He kept saying things like this.

It was strangely addictive, making me say it too.

“Inter is nothing.”

“Yeah, they’re nothing.”

In no time, Inter became nothing in less than two minutes.

“The opponent will raise their line and press us hard from the second half.”

Then the coach moved the magnetic pieces on the tactics board.

He said there’s something constant even if they raise their line.

“From Lazio to now leading Inter, Gino has always maintained the back build-up.”

“The three-back and one defensive midfielder form a diamond shape for build-up.”

“But that’s not important.”

“The most important thing is that when this diamond formation is pressed, one midfielder drops down to help with the build-up.”

And the player helping with the build-up for Inter is Pietro Barella. If someone presses Pietro hard, Inter’s back build-up is likely to become less smooth, as the coach explained.

And the person to carry out this crucial task of pressing Pietro was, of course, Kenese.

With his overwhelming physicality, if he marked Pietro, the opponent would inevitably shrink back.

The slightly worrying part was his technical skill.

But just a slight nudge from Kenese would likely leave Pietro disoriented, so it wasn’t a big concern.

Maybe the coach was slightly worried about asking an 18-year-old forward to contribute heavily to defense.

The coach’s eyes often turned to Kenese.

He must have been worried.

What if he lost his mental focus?

But our Moai is different.

He just nodded while biting into a banana with a stoic look like a stone statue.

The short halftime ended.

As soon as we stepped onto the field, I could see the focused expressions of Inter players who had gathered themselves during halftime.

It’s not going to be easy.

But since we are leading 1-0, it’s not a problem.

If we play the second half like the first half,

The victory will belong to Parma, not Inter.

* * *

It's rough.

Really rough.

Unlike the first half, Inter seemed to be playing rough to shake Parma’s mental focus in the second half.

I rolled on the field a couple of times.

Unusually, I didn’t feel unfair.

I even felt a bit sorry.

I just rolled lightly a couple of times.

But Pietro, marked by Kenese, already looked dazed, as if he couldn’t gather his senses.

Even so, Inter was much more threatening to our goal in the second half.

Although Giovanni was absent, Michele Sepe calmly blocked Inter’s shots.

Thanks to that, Inter grew more impatient.

Conversely, I started to develop a bit of an obsession with scoring.

I promised an Inter hardcore fan to score a hat-trick.

But I wasn’t getting the ball.

The opponent raised their line tight.

I moved between Inter’s defense, threatening them, and Kenese was enthusiastically bullying Pietro like kneading pasta dough.

Fearing someone might really get hurt, Gino substituted Pietro.

Gino’s choice of replacement was a forward.

A relatively small player.

I immediately recognized who he was as soon as he stepped onto the field.

Monica might also recall Arsenal seeing this player.

Not sure if it’s a good memory, though.

- Salvador Sanchez steps onto the field!

- Gino opts for Salvador Sanchez! It seems he intends to be more aggressive.

- This might disrupt the central balance a bit.

- Anyway... Gino’s decision is to strengthen the attack.

Most second-half substitutions aim to either set the stage for a comeback, disregarding the balance, or to maintain the current score by giving up on attacking.

Naturally, the tactical coherence and movements might be less precise than in the first half.

However, such substitutions are often made to utilize the fresh stamina of the replaced player and the unbalanced tactics to create variables.

From my recent tactical studies, I realized that Gino’s achievements with Lazio were not just a moment of luck.

Inter is no longer afraid of conceding.

They just revealed their intention to attack and score.

Salvador Sanchez.

The king of ‘memes’ and disasters.

For Manchester United fans, he’s remembered poorly because of the ‘77 million’ mockery.

However, he was still active as a regular and rotation player at Inter.

Anyway,

Inter showed their intent first by making a substitution.

Now it’s our turn to respond.

Coach Alain Levagne prepared a substitution.

Seeing the first player being replaced, I immediately understood the coach’s intention.

- Marian Kurtić is out, and Gianluca Inglese is in!

- Parma also adds a forward! This means they are not satisfied with the 1-0 score!

This turns our formation from 3-4-3 to a 3-3-4, a near-geometric anomaly.

With Gianluca’s introduction, I got the message that the coach intended to focus more on me.

Gianluca winked at me as he stepped onto the field.

Frankly, getting a wink from a guy in his thirties should feel unpleasant, but knowing it means the attack will focus on me, it didn’t feel too bad.

Still, I prefer Monica’s wink.

It’s sexy.

Yay.

Alright, let’s focus on the game again.

As players were substituted one by one, the game’s tempo became incredibly fast, unlike typical Italian league games.

Almost EPL-level tempo.

The ball transitioned quickly between offense and defense, giving both teams' defenses a hard time.

- The ball is connected to Minho again!

- Parma entrusts the attack to Minho, who is in great form today!

- Given Minho’s excellent performance against Inter today, it’s a reasonable choice.

Tap!

I caught the ball near the halfway line.

I dribbled forward slowly.

Inter pressed me hard, unlike before.

But I had no intention of giving in as before.

After all, football isn’t a one-man game.

And the pressing was strong, but the cooperative defense was sloppier than before.

They must be exhausted.

I passed the ball lightly to the side.

Gianluca, who received the ball, connected it to Gennaro on the opposite side, breaking the press.

Gennaro’s breakthrough followed.

But soon, finding himself surrounded, he scanned the surroundings.

He passed the ball to the center where I raised my hand.

Though slightly inaccurate, it wasn’t a problem.

Tap!

I received the ball lightly as if catching a feather, earning brief gasps of admiration from Inter’s home fans who had been jeering.

Such a first touch is only possible for me on good days, and it’s thrilling.

I didn’t hold the ball long.

I passed it back to Gianluca in the center.

Gianluca returned it to me.

After a body feint to beat the opponent, I turned into the half-space, making Inter tense.

It was a pattern I often showed.

Pretending to move to the flank but turning back to shoot with my right foot like Quaresma or curling a beautiful left-footed shot like Robben.

Inter knew this well.

Maybe because of this, two players stuck to me tightly, preventing me from turning easily.

Normally, I’d pass to the flank to break free.

But today is different.

My body feels as light as if God blessed me.

Tap!

I chipped the ball over, sending it over myself and the two defenders.

I turned smoothly between them, following the ball.

Oh! This must really look like Ronaldinho.

Even I felt thrilled.

- Wow! Minho! Minho! He dribbles past two Inter players in an instant!

- It was like watching Ronaldinho again on the field! Truly amazing!

- Minho! Minho!

- He breaks through to the danger zone!

Finally, after dodging a deep tackle from a defender with a Marseille turn, I lightly dragged the ball and finished with a lob kick over the goalkeeper rushing out.

“Ah!”

How desperate must the goalkeeper be to scream?

Even as Samir Handanovic slid and reached up, the ball had already soared over him, hitting the net.

Thwack.

A display of sheer brilliance.

I ran to the away section where Parma fans were and stretched my arms wide.

But the cheers were louder than usual.

I realized that Inter fans were applauding me, too.

How great must my play have been for the packed Giuseppe Meazza Stadium to give me a standing ovation?

Honestly, I was a bit moved.

Maybe tomorrow, urology clinics in Korea or Parma might get busy.

Of course, I’m joking.

But the fact that I could play like this...

I wish my body always felt like this.

It’s somewhat regretful.

But something feels off.

Why is Coach Gino Inzaghi, who should look at me with hostility, smiling slightly?

And why does our coach look gloomy even though I scored such a fantastic goal?

‘Transfer fee... how much... dirt cheap...’

I think I heard something like this as I passed near Inter’s technical zone after scoring.

Is it related to that?

I definitely scored...

Coach Gino is smiling faintly, and our coach looks depressed.

I don’t get it.

Am I the weird one?
