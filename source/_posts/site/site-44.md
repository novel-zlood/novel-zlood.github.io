## 17. Professor Park Minho!(3)

Juventus.

Inter.

AC Milan.

Three Koreans who cheer for these three teams.

Unlike their usual bickering, they were chatting under a peach tree as if they were Yu Bi, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei making a pact of brotherhood.

-KingWangZzangYuve: Oh! Victory Korea!

-RealMilan: Yeah, Germany lost to Korea 2-0, LOL

-LoveMilan: You guys are just soccer noobs!

Roberto couldn't understand them.

Germany wasn't an easy opponent.

Though their pride had been hurt recently.

There was a saying that "Football is a sport where 22 players fight in two teams, and Germany wins in the end." That’s how great a team they are.

Yet, these crazy Koreans were acting as if Germany was a weak soccer nation.

Well, he could understand.

They had the memory of Korea beating Germany 2-0 in the 2018 Russia World Cup.

But it was strange that they were so confident in Korea's victory just because of that.

Of course, with Park Minho, who was like a god in Parma, on Korea's side.

It's impossible to be weak.

Plus, there's Shin Junseo, the ace of Tottenham.

And a few other players in the EPL.

Korea is definitely a strong team.

But you can't be sure of a victory against Germany.

Yet, these crazy Koreans were acting like they were on drugs.

It was a bit scary.

-RealMilan: Yeah, with 4 matches against Germany's A team, we've won 2 and lost 2, right?

-LoveMilan: Except for the losses in the 1994 and 2002 World Cups, we’ve won the recent 2 matches, right?

-KingWangZzangYuve: Yeah, Germany is just noobs, LOL

He really couldn't understand.

So he asked.

What would they do if they lost to Germany?

Then the three started to pick on Italy along with Roberto.

-LoveMilan: Yeah, LOL, Italy is noobs too, LOL

-RealMilan: Got beaten by Korea in the 2002 World Cup, right?

-KingWangZzangYuve: LOL, Italy! Come back stronger!

There’s an Italian pride.

Especially, soccer is like their heart.

How could they provoke with soccer?

Damn crazy Koreans.

-Roberto: Just because you won once in 02!

-Roberto: Hey! Let's go again!

-Roberto: I'm confident we can crush you if we play again!

Roberto was trembling in anger.

But the crazy Koreans' reaction only fueled his rage.

-RealMilan: Yeah, Italy sucks at soccer~

-LoveMilan: We don't play with soccer noobs~

-KingWangZzangYuve: Always noobs~

Trembling Roberto.

But he smiled brightly at the arrival of reinforcements.

-Monica: What are you talking about?

-Roberto: Monica! These crazy Koreans are mocking Italy, saying we suck at soccer!

-Roberto: We're the European champions who won the Euro 2020!

-Roberto: Korea is no match for us!

Surely, Monica would agree with him.

But Monica coldly refuted.

-Monica: ?

-Monica: England is the best.

-Monica: The home of football is England.

Only then did Roberto realize.

Monica's mother was English.

This chameleon-like woman.

‘She was cheering for Italy when Euro 2020 was happening!’

That's why he hated mixed blood.

At the moment Roberto squinted his eyes.

Park Minho delivered the final blow.

-Park Minho: Roberto! There's an Americano I made in your fridge! Enjoy!

Roberto finally exploded in anger.

“Porca Zio! (Damn you!)”

* * *

Roberto.

Your sin is great.

Enjoying pasta and pizza in front of me a few days ago, you deserve punishment!

“What are you messaging so much?”

“Nothing much. Just Italian friends.”

“Wow... how is Italy? When I went on a West Ham away game, I heard a lot of racist DVD comments.”

“That’s just cute.”

“Ugh! That’s a bit scary.”

Sunbae Shin Junseo shuddered.

But come to think of it, there are always racists wherever you go.

They share a strange common trait.

They always look down on Asians halfway.

Look at Kenese, a mixed-race black from Slovakia.

Those who tried to racially discriminate against him?

They realized they’d be split into 'no/ms' instead of 'guys' and just shut up and passed by.

But they call me a yellow monkey.

Stupid racists.

You’re a white gorilla. Ook ook!

Anyway.

Their actions and words are so childish that honestly, it doesn’t hurt that much.

Moreover, while playing in Parma, anyone who made racist remarks to me got properly punished.

Mess with little Minho of Parma, you get screwed.

You really get screwed.

“It’s been a while since we played against Germany.”

“How do you feel?”

“They're strong. Honestly, we won against them in the Russia World Cup partly because they got impatient.”

Sunbae Shin Junseo recalled Germany from the Russia World Cup with a nostalgic look.

Would the Germany then be different from the Germany now?

When I asked Sunbae Shin Junseo, he shook his head.

“They’re the same.”

“Really?”

“Yeah, their squad is really solid. Even if you list their 2nd and 3rd teams, they're full of scary players.”

“Wow...”

“France is similar too. The real European powerhouses don’t feel like just reserves. They’re really strong.”

On the other hand, Korea is different.

The first team squad can compete with Europe.

But the quality of the rotation members drops significantly.

Call it national pride if you want.

But the Korea team is truly good.

Led by Sunbae Shin Junseo, it feels well-organized.

I feel a bit excited to be playing among them.

“Facing such a strong team with their first team... I’m a bit worried.”

Sunbae Shin Junseo seemed worried that we might lose by a large margin and our performance might decline.

But I thought we had a chance.

Germany?

We've already beaten them twice.

Why not a third time?

I grew more confident during training.

Yes, we are Korea.

The Tigers of Asia.

The Korean National Team.

I thought we had a good chance of winning.

But.

When I saw Germany's starting lineup a day before the match, I couldn't help but shut my mouth.

Germany was serious about this friendly match.

A lineup filled with their first team.

Something felt off.

[Florian Kretschmann, the coach of the German national team, declares! Germany will not underestimate any team!]

[Coach Florian: 'Korea is a strong team! This is the first time I'm fielding all my starters under my regime. We will do our best to secure a win.']

Why are you so tense?

You guys aren’t usually like this?

Won’t you let your guard down?

* * *

Florian Kretschmann.

At the young age of 36, he took the helm of the German national team. He began his football career at 26 and started managing in the Dutch second division at 30.

Though his tactical abilities were lacking.

His excellent man-management and quick decision-making saved his teams from crises, leading him to become the coach of the German U-19 team.

He rose steadily through the youth national teams and eventually succeeded Coach Julian Löw.

Starting with his debut as the German national team coach.

He showcased overwhelming attacking power in the 2022 Qatar World Cup qualifiers, securing Germany’s spot in the World Cup.

His style is reminiscent of Coach Jupp Heynckes, emphasizing quick attacking over possession and using fullbacks aggressively in constant pressing and switching.

Some criticized him as a poor man’s Jupp Heynckes.

But.

While he might lack in tactical aspects.

His veteran man-management in cutting off opponents’ tactics in the second half and his flexibility to quickly change strategies were rated higher than Jupp Heynckes.

He was watching a video of a certain player.

“Amazing.”

Incredibly precise.

He had a similar impact to Messi.

But didn’t play like Messi.

Last time, he perfectly mimicked the unique Ginga of Brazilian players, surprising everyone.

Recently, he reminded him of Lewandowski, steadily adding points.

A chameleon-like player.

He thought this player might be the one most loved by coaches around the world.

“Minho.”

A Korean playing in the Serie B league in Italy.

Watching Park Minho’s video, Coach Florian clenched his fist.

He thought that if he ever stepped down from the German national team, he would like to have this player on his field.

Enough distractions.

He shook his head.

They were about to play against Korea.

He couldn’t just marvel at an opponent’s player.

He was the coach who had to stop that player.

“Good team.”

The build-up football of Korea, meticulously prepared by Coach Pedro, was indeed well-organized.

But if asked whether they were a tough team to face, he could firmly shake his head no.

Germany was strong.

“What happened last time won’t happen again.”

He was certain.

The current Germany was not the rusty tank that wobbled in the 2018 Russia World Cup.

Determined to field all the starters except for Toni Kroos, Coach Florian nodded.

“I’m looking forward to tomorrow.”

Tomorrow, Germany would start their revenge for 2018.

In preparation for the 2022 Qatar World Cup, the Korean team would be a great sacrifice for Germany.

* * *

Toni Kroos.

Eric De Bruyne.

They are the players I’ve been analyzing lately.

They are similar yet different in a subtle way.

Both are exceptional with both feet.

Their kicking, vision, and football intelligence are superb.

Both moved from the second line to the third line, making them quite similar.

But that’s where the similarities end.

Looking deeper, they are entirely different types of players.

Toni Kroos isn’t as fast as Eric De Bruyne, nor is his defense up to his class.

He’s the best deep-lying playmaker in the world with excellent passing and ball-keeping abilities.

But he’s not Eric De Bruyne.

De Bruyne plays as a Mezzala in Manchester City, a bit higher than the third line, making it hard to call him a third-line player like Toni Kroos.

Furthermore, from 2020, he often plays in a free role, frequently seen in the second line.

Especially when key attackers like Sergio Aguero are out, he sometimes plays as a false nine.

Really.

De Bruyne’s ground crosses were amazing.

Of course, Toni Kroos also excelled at strong and low ground crosses.

But the highlight reels only showed his ground long shots.

Well... Goals make a stronger impression.

It’s understandable.

Anyway.

Why am I bringing this up?

Because Toni Kroos, whom I watched in the analysis videos, is now sitting on the bench.

He reversed his retirement from the national team.

At Coach Florian’s request, he decided to accompany the team until the 2022 Qatar World Cup.

Seeing Toni Kroos in person made me a bit nervous.

But it’s really a pity.

Because Toni Kroos is sitting on the bench?

I wanted to see him play live.

It’s really disappointing.

Is there no way?

After a brief thought, I realized.

If we make Germany use a substitute card.

How?

We score first.

But scoring first against Germany?

Some might think it’s crazy.

But my national team partner is Tottenham's ace.

Sunbae Shin Junseo.

We can figure something out.

“Sunbae.”

“Yeah?”

“Let’s try a strategy together.”

Sunbae Shin Junseo widened his eyes.

Then smiled at my suggestion.

“That sounds fun.”

* * *

Coach Pedro sighed.

Germany was well-prepared today.

On the other hand, his team always seemed lacking.

“Should I be happy?”

At his question, the head coach nodded.

Their opponent was Germany.

The Germany that was ready to spar genuinely, why would they dislike that?

“Camiel Neuer, Virde Sule, Maximilian Ginter, Theo Werner, Kenny Havertz.”

“Excluding injured players, it’s a full starting lineup.”

“Right.”

“Should we be thankful that Toni Kroos isn’t playing?”

It’s overwhelming.

Considering the names on their roster.

Even the players on Germany’s bench had more depth compared to Korea.

Like Coach Pedro’s stern expression.

The commentators also showed some concern.

-Just looking at the starting lineup makes my legs shake. This shows that Germany is seriously checking their tactics for this friendly match.

-Coach Pedro seems to have thought a lot.

-At the forefront, it’s Hwang Yuhyun.

-In the second line, there are Shin Junseo, Park Minho, and Jung Yoohyuk.

Just as Germany was well-prepared.

Korea also prepared the best squad.

From the first to the third lines, all were composed of overseas players.

They even called Lee Minjun from Turkey for the defense.

Korea prepared a lot, just like Germany.

-The friendly match between Korea and Germany has started!

The match finally began.

With Korea taking the first possession.

-The ball is passed to Park Minho of Parma. Isn’t he amazing recently?

-Yes, he’s been showing incredible performances in Serie B...

The Korean commentators, about to share various information about Park Minho, suddenly fell silent.

No, they became busier.

Because Park Minho was showing something different from what they expected.

-What? Park Minho has the ball and is running! He passed Kenny Havertz in an instant!

-He’s fast! So fast!

As Park Minho dashed forward.

Even the great Germany was startled.

Korea’s sudden offensive.

Even some Korean players were surprised by Park Minho’s movement and quickly adapted.

Except for one player.

As the match began, Shin Junseo, stuck close to Maximilian Ginter, who was not very agile or good at utilizing his physicality, widened his eyes.

As Park Minho dodged two players and drew attention.

At the moment Germany lost sight of speedster Shin Junseo, Park Minho didn’t miss the chance.

Boom!

A strong pass headed towards the back of Germany's defense.

Only then did Maximilian Ginter realize his mistake.

He had lost track of the player he should’ve marked.

“Ah!”

Shin Junseo, perfectly timing his run to break the offside trap, sprinted towards the ball.

He shot powerfully in the opposite direction of Germany’s goalkeeper, Camiel Neuer, who rushed out.

Thud!

The ball neatly shook the net.

Shin Junseo felt a thrilling sensation up his back and smiled.

It was a perfect pass.

The trajectory he visualized.

It was delivered perfectly to his feet.

This was the first time he received such a pass in his life.

-Gooooooal! Goal! Goal! Korea scores in the 47th second of the first half! Korea's ace, Shin Junseo, succeeds in scoring!

-Oh! That pass was perfectly timed! Park Minho’s pass was beautiful!

The broadcast camera moved quickly.

As if asking if anyone came to mind.

-The camera is showing Toni Kroos.

-Haha! That play indeed reminded us of Toni Kroos's precise and clean passes!

After scoring, Shin Junseo celebrated with a click gesture and enjoyed the moment with Park Minho.

But Park Minho’s gaze was fixed on the German bench.

What would the German professor think of Park Minho’s special lecture?

As Park Minho returned to his position with curiosity.

Toni Kroos was watching him and smiling.

He thought.

It would be fun to play with that player.
