## 24. Qatar World Cup (2)

The final roster for South Korea was bound to be controversial due to various issues.

This World Cup included the highest number of players under 21, while those excluded were mostly overseas players.

- Why was Hwang Yuhyeon left out?

- Why should we pick a player who transferred from Wolves to Dortmund and only played in 5 games?

- Kang Joowon is also out.

- Honestly, even without those two, we have Shin Junseo and Park Minho, so there shouldn't be a problem.

- This is the first squad that feels so disappointing.

- I have less hope than for the 2018 Russia World Cup.

Key players, categorized as core resources, either lost their starting positions in their clubs and saw a drop in performance, or missed many games due to injuries.

As a result, young players chosen as replacements faced criticism.

Coach Pedro managed to alleviate this through an interview.

[Coach Pedro: "Don't ask why I picked young players. They were selected because they are qualified."]

Of course, those who love to criticize tore into the young players and Coach Pedro, dissecting and savoring every bit, tormenting them to the core.

Naturally, the young players felt intimidated.

Junseo hyung was doing well to comfort them, but their tense expressions didn't easily loosen up.

Sigh... I want to achieve something in this World Cup.

But with this atmosphere, it seemed difficult.

So, I decided to take the lead.

When I was first called up to the national team over a year ago, the veteran players supported me until the end. I felt I needed to do the same for these young players.

[Park Minho: "We are the best team in Asia. We can definitely make it to the round of 16 by defeating France and the Netherlands."]

[Park Minho: "In the upcoming friendlies against Switzerland and Wales on the 11th and 15th, we'll show our performance."]

After my confident interview was published,

Junseo hyung and other veteran players supported me.

[Lee Daeseong: "Yongcheol is a really good player. Despite being 18 years old, he's very composed."]

[Jo Minwoo: "This squad feels promising. We have confidence to survive this group of death."]

The focus that was directed at young players like Yongcheol shifted back to us.

Those who just follow issues looked at us with an attitude of, "Really? You're that confident? Let's see."

The international football community turned into a battlefield of nationalism and detractors, tearing at each other.

Now that we've diverted external attention,

It's time to build our internal strength.

"Hey! Yongcheol! With more confidence!"

At Coach Pedro's shout, Park Yongcheol, who had made a mistake, got even more tense and made a bigger mistake.

It wasn't just the 18-year-old players.

Lee Juho, Lee Junsik, Park Sangjin, Lee Hanbeom.

Even the players under 21 were more nervous than usual.

Even during training.

Junseo hyung decided to comfort the remaining players, and I took it upon myself to take care of the young ones.

"What are you doing? We have a friendly match against Switzerland soon! Are you going to move around like an idiot there too?"

Lee Daeseong sunbae took on the role of the bad cop.

I tried to get closer to the young players by being the good cop.

"Yongcheol-ah! Don't be too scared."

"We have a guy named Santiago on our team."

"That guy only scored 1 goal and made 1 assist in 11 games this season."

Yes, our slacker's performance this first half was quite dismal.

This was unavoidable.

With tactical adjustments, Santiago had to move to a more defensive position.

"Really?"

"That guy was called up to the Argentina national team this time."

"Oh!"

"Do you know why? Santiago keeps challenging himself despite frequent mistakes, just like you."

Actually, it was because he was called in as a replacement for an injured backup to Messi.

Moreover, despite his poor league performance, our slacker had 3 goals and 2 assists in 4 Europa League games.

In other words, his overall skills had significantly improved.

But I didn't tell Yongcheol that.

"There are bound to be ups and downs at a young age. I was a complete mess in high school."

"I believe you can make it in Europe, just like Santiago in our team."

"So don't be scared and give it your all."

I didn't mention that our slacker had recently become more consistent.

"Yes! I'll do my best!"

There's no need to say more.

What our Yongcheol needs now is 'pride.'

A strong motivation that says 'I can do it!'

However, the other young players, excluding the innocent 18-year-old Yongcheol, showed rather indifferent expressions.

Tsk tsk...

I guess it's time to show them the authority of an adult.

How, you ask?

We have two upcoming friendly matches, don't we?

Traditionally, an adult’s authority comes from ‘money and skill.’

I learned this from Kang Sajangnim of the local football club.

By leading the team with elegant passes befitting the nickname "Ricquelme of Wonjong-dong," and treating the team to beef without a word after the game, Kang Sajangnim's authority still lingers in my mind.

"I don't know about money... But I do have skills."

Yeah, what's the point of having better skills than others?

Skills are meant to be used at times like this.

In the midst of various issues, the evaluation match against Switzerland in Korea before leaving for Qatar.

Coach Pedro brought out the 4-3-3 formation he had prepared for a long time to re-examine the tactics.

Honestly, it wasn't a bad tactic.

Unlike Parma, the method of building up gradually and controlling the entire game had its own merits.

-Today, Park Yongcheol makes his A-match debut at the young age of 18.

-There were many discussions about Park Yongcheol's call-up, but I believe he is a resource that can definitely make it in the adult stage.

All eyes were bound to be on Yongcheol.

Honestly, this was inevitable.

I also received even more attention when I made my A-match debut.

Enduring that was up to the player.

Still, I believed Yongcheol would handle it well.

As expected, Yongcheol started playing harder than anyone else.

-Park Yongcheol! Once again, he intercepts Switzerland's pass energetically and brings the ball to South Korea's territory.

-It's just a little past 5 minutes into the first half, but Park Yongcheol's movements are particularly noticeable.

His performance wasn't bad.

There were a lot of strange passes here and there.

At least in terms of activity and defense, no one could blame Yongcheol.

Well, that's enough about our youngest.

It's time for me to move to back up my words from the interview.

Here comes Yongcheol's long pass.

-Park Minho! He's fast!

-Kevin Ambrosini from Switzerland! He was too complacent! He underestimated Park Minho's speed!

Despite getting scolded at Juventus, he still hasn’t learned his lesson.

As I moved to the half-space, leaving the opponent who gritted his teeth and reached out, Switzerland's defense started buzzing like hornets whose nest had been attacked.

Even though it’s just a friendly match.

Switzerland's defense wasn't very organized.

This was a bit disappointing.

Seeing the clumsy defense, I immediately curled the ball with my right foot, aiming at the corner of Switzerland's goal.

-Park Minhoooooooo!

-Goaaaaal! It’s in! Park Minho's sharp curling shot hits the net!

-That's it! Park Minho often showcased such beautiful curling shots in Serie A!

-What a fantastic shot. This goal proves why Park Minho is Parma's ace!

Yongcheol looked at me with sparkling eyes.

He knew.

That his pass was terrible.

And I turned that into a goal.

Since his mistake turned into an 'assist.'

Wouldn't he feel a proper sense of pride?

This goal was just the beginning.

Right after scoring, I delivered a clean pass to Junseo hyung, who was looking for an opportunity on the opposite wing.

-Shin Junseo! Gooooal!

-A fantastic goooal by Shin Junseo! South Korea takes a 2-0 lead against Switzerland!

-South Korea is strong! There was a reason for their confidence shown in previous interviews!

Two goals in the first half.

One goal in the second half.

South Korea secured a pleasant result with a 3-0 victory against Switzerland.

Seeing the decent performance of the young players and the play of Junseo hyung and me, fans seemed to start having a bit of hope.

[South Korea defeats Switzerland 3-0!]

[Overwhelming offensive power! Former head coach Cha Beomsoo evaluates this as the strongest offensive lineup in history.]

[Coach Pedro: "It was a perfect match. The players showed exactly the soccer I wanted."]

[Park Minho! Backs up his words from the interview with a dominant performance against Switzerland!]

[1 goal and 2 assists! Shin Junseo's partner is indeed Park Minho!]

Interest in the national team, which had low expectations, seemed to rise slightly.

Moreover, the young players gained confidence from this victory, making it a very successful evaluation match.

* * *

After the evaluation match against Switzerland, Coach Pedro clenched his fist and showed confidence.

Especially because the young players rapidly filled the key midfield and forward positions, which were vacated, making this evaluation match already a success.

However, he couldn't let his guard down.

The opponents were France, the Netherlands, and Morocco.

All teams rated higher than South Korea.

Their squad compositions were also excellent.

Some experts predicted that even if South Korea managed just one draw in the World Cup, it would be considered a success.

The opponents were that formidable.

However, the internal atmosphere of the team was good.

"I didn't expect Minho to have leadership."

Thanks to Park Minho, who unexpectedly unified the young players well, the team's atmosphere was at its peak.

Captain Shin Junseo managed the entire team.

Vice-captain Lee Daeseong took care of the veterans.

The third vice-captain, Park Minho, took care of players under 21.

An ideal team atmosphere was formed.

Additionally, the initially cynical reactions from South Korean fans were slowly turning positive.

"This is all thanks to Minho."

A player who accumulates attack points in every game.

Who in South Korea wouldn't be hopeful seeing such a player?

Thanks to this, the national team could head to Qatar with everything they could get from Korea.

Still, not everything was going perfectly.

People were still lurking around the national team, looking for articles to nitpick.

Moreover, they even criticized Coach Pedro's tactics from today's match.

Of course, no tactics are perfect.

Coach Pedro was well aware of his shortcomings.

But wasn’t it too much to suddenly ask to change the tactics he had been preparing for three years?

[South Korea needs to adopt more offensive tactics for Park Minho and Shin Junseo!]

In addition, the criticisms directed at players other than Shin Junseo and Park Minho were severe.

No, it was closer to slander than criticism.

"But we can endure."

In this unfavorable environment, Coach Pedro could endure solely because of Park Minho.

He was a player who could perfectly fill the gaps in his tactics.

In training, he worked harder than anyone else, and on the field, he could shine like a star and had the bold heart to take the spotlight for other players.

There wasn't a coach who wouldn't love such a player.

A player who suddenly emerged like a comet had become indispensable to the South Korean national team.

"The attacking midfielders of South Korea won’t lose to any team in the world."

With such players, Coach Pedro couldn't fathom the idea of being eliminated in the group stage.

With that confidence, the national team headed to Qatar and prepared for the evaluation match against Wales on November 15th.

Coach Pedro continued to experiment with various combinations by extensively utilizing young players again.

And he achieved some results.

South Korea’s attack, centered around Park Minho and Shin Junseo, was enough to shake Wales' defense.

-Park Sangbin goooooal!

-Amazing! A goal created by Park Minho!

-Starting from the Switzerland match, young players are gradually producing results!

20-year-old Park Sangbin felt goosebumps as he received Park Minho’s precise pass.

As he moved down to the third line and strengthened the center, he thought as he saw the game unfolding,

"This... is how a player from one of the top 4 leagues moves!"

It was inevitable to feel admiration.

Moreover, as Park Minho disrupted Wales’ defense, Shin Junseo exploited the space to score another goal.

The score widened to 4-0.

South Korea achieved a near-perfect victory against Wales.

It was an astonishingly close-to-perfect victory.

After the match,

The young players began to gain confidence in their eyes.

"Maybe..."

"Can we really make it to the round of 16?"

"Having won so dominantly against Switzerland and Wales... Isn't there a real possibility?"

"We might really do it?"

The eyes of young players, once weighed down by tension and pressure, began to show a glimmer of hope.

Park Minho smiled as he looked at those young players.

He felt that now he could finally play some real football.
