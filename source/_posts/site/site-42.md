## 17. Professor Park Minho! (1)

"Uwaaaaa! Yes! This is it!"

"Mino! Mino! Mino!"

Serie B, Round 28.

A match against Benevento, who are 4th in the league.

Everyone jumped out of their seats at Park Minho's winning goal, which came just after the 45th minute of the second half.

Coach Alain Levagne clenched his fists and shouted Park Minho's name loudly.

To be honest, today's match was a bit off.

With Lautaro Valentia and Stanko Toric out due to accumulated yellow cards, the defense was not at full strength.

Benevento took advantage of that.

Despite Giovanni's efforts, they quickly conceded three goals to the opponent.

Still, the fact that Parma was able to turn the score to 4-3 was all thanks to Park Minho.

One goal and two assists, including the winning goal just now.

He dominated the entire match today.

Even though Benevento's midfielders dropped lower to prevent Park Minho's advance.

They couldn't stop him.

"You bastard!"

"Why did that monster join Parma? We had a chance with him at Benevento too!"

Benevento's home fans ruffled their hair.

Until recently, this player was just an ordinary person, but now he had become nothing short of a god for Parma Calcio.

"Uwaaaaa! Mino! Mino! Mino!"

"Just hold on for one more minute! Protect the goal that Mino scored!"

"Miiii-nooooooo!"

Despite Benevento's last attack, Parma's away fans chanted only Park Minho's name.

They looked like fanatics.

Benevento's clumsy last chance flew away.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The referee blew the whistle, signaling the end of the match.

A game barely won with a score of 4-3.

But Coach Alain Levagne jumped for joy as if they had won the final.

They were down 2-0.

Yet, they managed to come back and win 4-3.

Of course, it was a reason to be happy.

As soon as the match ended, the first person he ran to hug on the field was, of course, Park Minho.

"Hahaha! Mino! You were perfect!"

"I'll score even more goals next time."

"Nope! If you do that, big clubs will come after you, so just keep doing what you're doing now... No, even now, other clubs are drooling over you... Alright! Just like Santiago!"

"But then I won't be able to score any goals?"

"Damn it! Then... Then...!"

Coach Alain Levagne trembled with his whole body.

Park Minho smiled at Coach Alain Levagne.

On the bus back to Parma after the match, Coach Alain Levagne couldn't control his twitching cheeks as he thought about Park Minho's record.

'With this, Mino's league record is 30 goals and 24 assists. In the season, it's 37 goals and 28 assists.'

Overwhelming performance.

He couldn't help but smile.

If Alfredo Donnarumma of Ternana hadn't been showing insane scoring ability with 33 goals in the league,

Park Minho would have definitely been the top scorer in the league.

Is he just a player with excellent scoring ability?

No.

Park Minho is also an attacking player who provides a lot of assists.

Whether playing in the second line or in the first line, he was significantly assisting Kenese's goals.

Thanks to him, Kenese had scored 8 goals in 7 matches since his debut.

Considering that Kenese had the lowest effective shooting ratio among Parma's attackers, scoring 8 goals in 7 matches was impressive.

What this metric shows is

how good the quality of passes Kenese received was, despite his lack of dribbling skills.

'If Mino wasn't here...'

Kenese's debut would have been a failure.

Furthermore, maintaining the league's unbeaten streak would have been challenging.

Still, there was no time to relax.

The championship was now certain.

Parma's points were 80.

There was a 29-point gap with second-place Brescia.

With 10 matches remaining,

if they win the next match against Reggina, Parma would secure the championship.

But there was no room for complacency until the last match.

Parma's goal was no longer just winning the championship.

That trophy was a given.

Now, Parma's goal was to win all the remaining 10 matches and achieve an unbeaten championship.

Coach Alain Levagne thought it was a feasible goal.

He believed they could win all the remaining 10 league matches.

Before that, he had to do one thing.

"Ahem... Ahem..."

It was very embarrassing.

But since his daughters liked it, he had no choice.

Coach Levagne posted a picture of him hugging Park Minho on his private SNS, viewable only by his family.

And his daughters reacted quickly.

"Sigh..."

Is this what it feels like to be a father with daughters?

His two daughters, who usually grumbled at him and didn't talk much, fussed over Park Minho's picture.

Coach Levagne quietly thought.

Even he had to admit, Park Minho was indeed handsome.

* * *

"The wings are spreading out!"

"Move! Find space and move!"

After returning from the away match against Benevento,

Parma's training ground was hotter than usual.

They continued their unbeaten streak,

but almost lost to Benevento in the last match.

Now, 10 league matches remained.

If they don't lose these matches, they will leave their names in the history of Parma and Serie B.

How many players would refuse that?

Not me, nor that lazybones.

The players who felt the big crisis in the last match stayed in the training ground even after the training session ended.

"Is the next match a home game?"

"Yeah, against Reggina."

"They're in the relegation zone, right?"

"They're 18th in the league. They're only 2 points behind Como, who are 17th, so they'll probably come at us really hard."

"Playing against a relegation zone team trying to escape relegation? Ugh... I really hate that."

It's understandable that lazybones was freaked out.

Teams in the relegation zone fight like crazy towards the end of the season as if they've received a buff.

Yeah, the relegation buff.

You never know what result a team with that buff might produce, so you always have to stay alert.

Moreover, if they win against us, it's a great chance to escape the relegation zone.

They will fight tooth and nail.

Additionally, Parma, with relatively young and inexperienced players, is easily influenced by such aggressive opponents.

Still, we can overcome it well.

There have been many crises before.

Overcoming them, we have maintained our unbeaten streak until mid-March.

"Let's call it a day."

"Phew! That was really tough."

"We have to do the same intensity tomorrow."

"..."

That lazybones.

He'll probably skip the extra training tomorrow.

On the way out, after showering and packing up, I turned on my smartphone and saw messages from Monica.

-Monica: Mino! Is there some incident related to you in Korea?

-Monica: I saw it in the news?

-Monica: It's nothing serious, right?

-Monica: I trust you, Mino. So I'll wait!

It seemed Monica, who was learning Korean these days, found some news about me on a Korean site.

What the heck did she see...

Curious about what made Monica fuss, I searched the link she sent and found out that a somewhat related but not-really-related incident had occurred.

[Football YouTuber Mr. Baek accused of school violence during middle school!]

[Mr. Kim, 'Mr. Baek used to slap me and make me run cigarette errands during middle and high school.']

[Various suspicions pour out against Mr. Baek, who attended the same high school as Park Minho and Shin Junseo!]

Baek Seunghoon.

He was a bad connection.

And now, a past that I had completely turned away from.

Looking into the articles,

I saw that he had gone to the Han River in his underwear and jumped in.

Then he mentioned me and sucked up views on his YouTube channel.

But now, with today's revelation, he had hit rock bottom.

More than that, he was involved in school violence...

I recalled that I was too focused on football to notice what was happening around me.

So, that happened.

[Mr. Kim, 'Unlike Mr. Baek, player Park was really helpful during my school days. I would have had a hard time without him.']

I helped?

I just... bought meals for the juniors.

Trained with them.

When their football boots were torn, I gave them some new ones I had left over.

Helped with laundry when it seemed like there was a lot.

Shared a room with juniors who were particularly wandering around in the dorm and played games with them.

Ah, I don't know.

I told Monica I was fine.

It was just another guy who caused trouble.

I explained to Monica that my name was mentioned just because I was a classmate.

Monica said she was relieved and that she would come to Parma in a week, so I should wait a bit.

Quietly browsing through all the articles related to Baek Seunghoon, I turned off my smartphone.

There seemed to be no need to worry about it anymore.

Erasing Baek Seunghoon, who had ruined his own fortune, from my mind, I headed to the market to do some shopping.

Today, I would indulge a bit.

* * *

Franco and Marjan were out for the upcoming match against Reggina due to accumulated yellow cards.

With two key central players missing, our coach seemed to be quite worried.

Since winning this match would secure the Serie B championship, he seemed to be putting extra effort into it.

Well, Reggina would definitely come at us like madmen to avoid relegation, so I also focused intensely.

Lazybones asked me.

He said the training had gotten tougher lately.

It was a fact, as confirmed by Santiago, our official training inspector.

And March 12th arrived.

Parma fans flocking to Ennio Tardini.

From the second half of the season, every home game had been sold out, reflecting the high expectations of Parma fans.

Even though there was still some time left before the match started, our Parma fans were enthusiastically singing Parma's cheering song from outside the stadium.

(Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!)

(Son Crociati e tutti campioni!)

(Son del Parma i prodi calciatori!)

The atmosphere was already heated.

Moreover, there were fans who chanted only my name.

Pa-rk! Mi-no! Pa-rk! Mi-no!

Pa-rk! Mi-no! Pa-rk! Mi-no!

Pa-rk! Mi-no! Pa-rk! Mi-no!

Hearing the cheers for a player who had recorded 37 goals and 28 assists in the season made my chest swell with pride.

Really... I must do well today.

"Mino."

"Huh? What?"

"Let's win today."

Santiago was different from usual too.

I could see the strong desire to win today's match in his eyes.

Other players were similar.

Knowing that, Coach Alain didn't say much and sent the players onto the field.

Just like we were sharp,

Reggina also seemed similar.

Their eyes were filled with the desire to escape relegation, trying to secure even a single point.

Giovanni looked around at the gathered players and smiled.

"Don't think about winning the championship."

"Just think about giving the fans who came to the stadium today the joy of victory."

That was enough.

The players nodded with moderately heated expressions.

My heart was also pounding strangely.

Ah, it's not because I'm nervous.

Just... it felt good.

"Isn't that a heart disease?"

Lazybones' words shattered my emotions.

Damn! That's a jinx.

You know that's a very dangerous statement.

Especially considering the recent incidents in the football world with spectators and players collapsing from heart issues.

The more I thought about it, the more I felt that lazybones shouldn't be on SNS.

"Your SNS is confiscated."

"What? Mino! Do you know how fun SNS is?"

"That's why it's confiscated!"

"Mino!"

Lazybones.

Remember the famous quote from the great manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

He said SNS is a waste of life.

So, it's confiscated.

"This is tyranny!"

"Can you play football better than me?"

Upon hearing this, lazybones shut his mouth tightly.

Do you think it makes sense that a guy who has been a pro for just over seven months can play football better than me?

Anyway.

Lazybones' SNS is confiscated.

I'll return it when his football skills improve.

How to measure that?

Maybe if he records more assists or goals than me?

After a short issue passed,

the players stood in their respective positions.

Reggina had prepared a diamond 4-4-2 formation.

We had brought out our most exciting 3-4-3 formation.

This tactic definitely seemed to suit us best.

"Mino! One goal today too, please!"

"Miii-nooooo!"

"Pa-rk! Mi-no!"

I could hear the fans cheering.

Only one goal?

I feel like I can score two today.

Beep!

The referee blew the whistle.

Reggina had the ball first.

Parma immediately started pressing.

As expected, Parma took the initiative from the beginning and slowly pressured Reggina as the game progressed.

But.

Are these guys really a relegation zone team?

No, I've heard that such teams fight like crazy to survive towards the end of the season.

They're too clumsy.

What's this? Am I the weird one?

"Mino!"

The ball was neatly passed to me.

Should I just stir things up a bit?

* * *

-The ball is passed to Park Minho!

In Korea, the Serie B broadcast was also receiving a lot of attention for today's match.

It was a match that could secure the championship.

And since the opponent was a team that could escape relegation with a win, many watched the game with a 'just in case?' mindset.

However.

Contrary to their expectations, Parma.

No, to be precise, Park Minho did not allow Reggina any miracles.

-Oh? Park Minho! Park Minho! He's running! He's fast!

Park Minho, who received the ball at the center line, started running.

Receiving the ball taken from the opponent through strong pressing, Park Minho ran quickly.

The Korean commentators had no time to rest.

-Park Minho! Pass to Santiago!

-And back to him!

Park Minho lightly dribbled past Reggina's midfielders after exchanging passes with Santiago on the wing.

Another Reggina player rushed towards him.

But Park Minho increased his speed, shocking everyone.

-Uwaaa! Park Minho! He's dribbling while juggling! It's the dribble Thierry Henry used to show!

-As we speak, he lifts the ball high to get past the defender's height!

It was a sombrero flick.

In a shocking display, Reggina's players tried to stop Park Minho's breakthrough with fouls.

But they couldn't stop him.

-Park Minho! Fantastic step-over! So flashy! Reggina can't stop him!

A dazzling array of individual skills.

Had he sharpened his skills for this moment?

Park Minho quickly bypassed three players and charged towards the danger zone.

In an instant, the half-space opened wide.

Park Minho boldly struck an outside-foot kick with his right foot, leaving everyone with their mouths agape.

-Park Minho! Strikes with his right foot's outside front!

-Gooooooaaaaal!

-The ball curves like a banana and shakes the net!

-Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Fantastic play! Park Minho! It reminded me of Neymar or Ronaldinho!

As the Korean commentators screamed,

Park Minho, who scored the goal, ran quickly to the fans and spread his arms wide.

Pa-rk! Mi-no! Pa-rk! Mi-no!

Pa-rk! Mi-no! Pa-rk! Mi-no!

Pa-rk! Mi-no! Pa-rk! Mi-no!

Home fans chanting Park Minho's name.

Reggina's players, who had prepared thoroughly, felt helpless watching this.

"Really... How are we supposed to stop that?"

One player's despairing words made Reggina's players feel even heavier.

It was just past the 4th minute of the first half.

For the remaining time, the Reggina defender, who had to stop that monster, rubbed his face with a despairing expression.

It was inevitable to feel despair.

In today's match,

it seemed there would be no miracles for Reggina.
