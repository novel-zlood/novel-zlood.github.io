## 1. If You Don’t Like It, Do It Yourself! (3)

The second half began, and the players started moving around, looking for space according to their tactics.

It wasn't much different from typical amateur football.

Actually, there was one difference.

"They're really running a lot."

It was like an environment where someone like the logistics officer, who couldn't run, would struggle.

But even in such dire circumstances, our Sergeant Kang made a killer pass.

He was called the Riquelme of the 2nd Company.

In today’s match, my role seemed to be similar to that of a typical enganche.

No, perhaps it was closer to a trequartista?

‘The coach probably wants me to play more like Kaka or Totti than Riquelme.’

With that in mind, I watched closely.

I observed how this Parma team played without me.

"Pass it to the flank!"

"Quickly! Quickly!"

I listened to the conversations among the players.

I watched how they moved.

I felt how the ball moved.

For about 5 minutes into the second half, I quietly observed.

"I think I have a rough idea of what to do."

Was his name Santiago?

Even though I was an amateur, I was confident I could run better than that pig-like guy.

Yes, like this.

Thump!

One of the Parma players passed the ball to me and looked at me with a surprised expression.

I didn't know why he was so surprised.

As I started dribbling lightly and running forward, a player from Cosenza came charging at me.

He was underestimating me.

In a typical situation, he would keep a reasonable distance to see if I would break through or pass.

Even Kim, the manager from Singsingmulsan who plays in Korea's early morning football, wouldn't do such a thing.

Kim, at least, would block the passing route with his body to prevent a pass.

So, I easily dodged him.

I showed a very basic dribble and run.

Thanks to that, I saw the Cosenza fool, who confidently lunged at me, slip by my side in surprise.

If he had at least applied some pressure, he wouldn't have been so easily dodged.

"Stop him! Stop him!"

As I lightly dodged one player, another Cosenza player shouted in panic.

But they couldn't catch me as I accelerated.

The player I dodged hurriedly chased after me.

Of course, the difference was similar.

It meant that my speed while dribbling was equal to the defender's full sprint.

-Wowwwwwwwwww!

As I dribbled and ran, the home fans of Parma erupted in cheers.

"Stop him! Stop him!"

The opposing goalkeeper shouted.

Even though it was a friendly match, conceding a goal was unacceptable.

Swoosh!

A defender who quickly charged at me tried to cleanly slide tackle the ball.

‘A clean tackle.’

But I had no intention of losing the ball.

Seeing me quickly move to the side, another defender waiting behind tried to push me towards the flank.

Cosenza’s basic defense strategy was to push the opponent to the flank and have the two tall central defenders handle the high crosses or corners.

And the forwards would take the ball and run.

Even in the first half, the counterattack they conceded was obtained in this way.

So why did the Cosenza coach maintain such a simple defensive strategy?

‘It means the two central defenders have weak footwork.’

Thump! Thump-thump!

Just three touches.

That was enough to break down the defender trying to push me to the side.

"Ah!"

A short scream from the defender.

He had excellent overall clearing ability but was still a novice in timing his tackles.

I felt him hurriedly grabbing my jersey.

But it was too late.

The space in front of me opened up.

The opposing goalkeeper came out alone to cover that space.

Yes, in this situation, I had only one choice.

Thump!

The ball went over the goalkeeper's head.

Seeing the ball go into the net, I smiled brightly.

* * *

"He's definitely different."

Coach Alain Laban couldn't help but nod.

That Asian guy was not an ordinary person.

"What's his name again?"

"Not sure exactly, but I heard the Italians call him Mino."

"Really?"

Mino.

He was definitely a person who deserved to give such advice.

The way he played on the field was exactly the type of attacking midfielder Coach Alain Laban wanted.

‘A tactic that brings out the attacking midfielders like Kaka or Totti in modern football.’

He wanted to use such a nostalgic tactic.

The problem was Santiago couldn’t show that, but ironically, the ordinary spectator they put in to criticize Santiago showed exactly what he wanted.

"He really looks like Kaka."

The way he immediately dashed forward after dodging a player reminded him of Kaka in his prime.

Moreover, considering his excellent vision and movements exploiting the weaknesses of the opposing defense...

‘How is someone like him an ordinary person?’

He couldn’t understand.

Was it a coincidence?

Or was he originally a professional player in another country?

He didn’t know.

But in the 15 minutes given to that guy, the score between Parma and Cosenza showed significant changes.

[Parma 3:1 Cosenza]

Mino’s record was 1 goal and 1 assist.

"What should we do?"

In response to the assistant coach's question, Coach Alain Laban answered firmly.

"We should replace him."

He had already decided.

Whether they were winning or losing.

He would let the ordinary guy play for just 15 minutes and then take him out.

But seeing his performance in those 15 minutes, one plan in his mind had changed.

"Get his contact details."

"Understood."

Watching Park Minho being substituted for Sergei, Coach Alain Laban said briefly.

"Good game."

Park Minho smiled brightly at those words.

"Thank you."

* * *

The match between Parma and Cosenza ended 4-2.

After the friendly match, Parma’s specialist reporter Ugo Tonacci and a few other reporters nodded with satisfaction at the result.

"It wasn’t a bad result."

"Indeed, it felt like Coach Alain Laban’s aggressive tactics worked well throughout the match."

The overall assessment wasn’t bad.

Coach Alain Laban’s aggressive tactics worked well even in ‘Serie B.’

But it wasn’t all positive.

"Santiago, as expected..."

"It seems he fell out of Coach Alain Laban’s favor. I heard from an employee within the Parma club that he was kicked out of the locker room due to his poor performance in the first half."

"Appearing in preseason in such shape was honestly a problem. Coach Alain Laban handled it well."

And after such conversations, the final topic was about an Asian guy who played for just 15 minutes.

"Who is that guy?"

"I have no information. Where is he from? Japan?"

"Not sure... I don’t know."

An unknown player.

Despite playing for just 15 minutes, he was the most meaningful attacking midfielder for the team.

Hence, they were curious.

"Still, it’s fortunate. Santiago is such a mess, but we have someone to replace him."

"Sergei, who was substituted in the second half, was also decent."

"Can we expect something this year?"

They thought Parma would be different this year.

They had brought in a tactically solid coach.

They had talented players.

And they even recruited the team’s legend Buffon.

While everyone had high expectations for Parma.

Park Minho, who experienced professional football for the first time, looked at the business card in his hand with a puzzled expression.

"So... an agent?"

"Yes, I saw your potential in this friendly match."

"But I’m just an ordinary Korean student studying at Parma University."

"It doesn’t matter. In the professional world, as long as you play football well, that's enough. They don’t care who you are. Of course, crimes are an exception."

The man's name was Leo Carpentieri.

He was an Italian agent, and the most famous player he managed was Bruno Campos, a young player playing for AC Milan.

"But isn’t it too late? I’m 25 years old in Korean age... so 24 here."

"It’s not a problem. Even Jamie Vardy joined Halifax Town at the age of 23."

"Hmm..."

It was a dilemma.

He really liked football.

But seeing many geniuses in middle school, he quickly judged that he couldn’t make a living playing football.

So even though he enjoyed football, he didn’t dive deeply into it.

But now, several people were saying he had talent after seeing him play today.

Not just Roberto, who was excited about his performance and told him to try going pro.

But also Coach Alain Laban from Parma, who contacted him after the match, and the agent in front of him now.

Honestly, if it was just one person saying this, he would have laughed it off, thinking he was just lucky.

But when multiple people suggested it, even a stoic person would have to think, ‘Maybe?’

"So, can I take a short test?"

"A test?"

"Honestly, it feels a bit late to go pro at this age. I’m a bit scared to just believe your words and try to go pro."

"It’s not fear, it’s caution. Alright. If Mino says so... I will set up a small stage for your test."

"Really?"

"Yes, of course."

Leo Carpentieri nodded with a peculiar smile.

* * *

I’m scared.

Yes, the reason I quickly gave up on football after seeing incredible geniuses in middle school was because I was really scared.

Of course, I have no complaints about that.

I was just an ordinary young man from South Korea, well-adapted to the absurd realities.

A new opportunity came to me.

And I was scared and tried to avoid it again.

But when not just one, but several people said I had talent, I couldn’t help but think a bit.

So I made this request.

"Please test me. I want to know if I really have the talent for professional football."

I made this request because I was scared.

If I were a confident guy...

I would have signed a contract immediately and joined a team, enjoying football.

In that sense, Agent Leo, who moved to help with my test, was a bit peculiar.

Even though we hadn’t signed a contract, he acted as if I were his client.

"...."

And this was the result of his actions.

"A tryout?"

"Yes, a tryout."

"Who are those men over there?"

"Oh! Those guys are the scouts from Cosenza, the team you scored 1 goal and 1 assist against."

"And that person?"

"Don’t be surprised. That’s a scout from the famous Juventus."

"...."

"Moreover, 14 Serie B clubs sent scouts, and even a Premier League club, hearing your story, sent a scout."

"West Ham United?"

"Bingo."

Leo Carpentieri smiled brightly.

It was very annoying.

"Are these people jobless?"

"Excuse me?"

"They came all the way here just to see me?"

"Of course."

I couldn’t understand.

Wasn’t this just a test to see if I had the potential to go pro?

Why did this test turn into something like a tryout for a Korean genius midfielder?

"For what reason?"

Leo answered my question.

"Because of the videos I spread and the story of you and Parma. That’s why they came to see you."

He handed me a newspaper that had a picture of me roaring after scoring a goal.

[‘If You Don’t Like It, Do It Yourself!’ A bizarre episode in Parma Calcio’s friendly match where a spectator directly entered the field and scored!]

[Again 1994! A spectator directly entered and scored in the match between Parma and Cosenza, just like the West Ham vs. Oxford match!]

"...."

It felt like something had gone very wrong.
