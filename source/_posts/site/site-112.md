## Winter Transfer Market (3)

Jules Kaimbe began nurturing his dream of becoming a football player while watching his father, Peter Kaimbe.

His father was a fullback for Peterborough United, a team in League One, the third division of English football. Naturally, Jules also started playing football as a fullback and wingback, following in his father's footsteps.

At first, he received a tremendous amount of attention.

His overwhelming speed and solid physicality, compared to players his age, drew a lot of interest.

Thanks to this, he transferred to Southampton at the age of 18 and debuted in the Premier League at the age of 19.

Of course, his rapid speed inevitably caught the attention of many football fans.

- "Incredible speed! Kaimbe! Kaimbe! Keeps running and crosses! Goooooooal!"

- "The cross was slightly long, but Charlie Armstrong didn't miss it and scored!"

Although the assist wasn't recorded due to it hitting a defender's foot, Jules Kaimbe's debut left a strong impression on many EPL fans.

However, his success stopped there.

Even if he broke through the flanks with his speed, his crosses or passes rarely reached the players penetrating the center.

Moreover, he earned the stigma of never coming back down once he moved forward, and evaluations of him gradually declined.

Jules Kaimbe felt a significant barrier in the EPL.

For a while, football became very challenging for him.

He fell into a slump due to self-doubt, and even his speed, his last strong point, couldn't shine.

By the time he turned 21, Jules Kaimbe of Southampton began to fade from the minds of football fans.

He tried to improve his lacking defensive skills, but it wasn't easy.

Just when even the coaches at Southampton were about to give up on him, he received a call from a team interested in signing him in the winter transfer market.

"Arsenal?"

"Their coach is renowned for nurturing young talent. Just look at the young players he developed at Parma."

"Hmm..."

"I recommend going. It might be hard to get satisfactory playing time, but at least the name 'Arsenal' on your resume will significantly impact your value, even if you transfer to a lower league."

Jules Kaimbe pondered over the agent's words.

It was the right decision for his career.

After all, Arsenal is considered a strong team in the current EPL.

However, he worried whether he could get proper playing time at Arsenal.

Still, he had no choice but to consider the transfer.

The weekly wage was double that of Southampton.

For the treatment of his beloved father, what he needed most right now was money.

Arsenal's offer met all his urgent needs.

However, there was one problem.

"A position change?"

One of the conditions Arsenal proposed was a position change.

Arsenal saw Jules Kaimbe as the next Gareth Bale, and after some deliberation, Jules accepted all of Arsenal's conditions.

Returning to the present, Jules Kaimbe gulped as he made his first arrival at Arsenal's training ground.

"This is... Arsenal."

Among the famous players, the league's top striker Park Minho caught his eye.

The staff member guiding him smiled as they saw Jules staring at Park Minho.

"Amazing, right?"

"Ah... It's a bit amazing."

The best striker in the current EPL.

A player who consistently performs well both on the flanks and in the center, responsible for a third of Arsenal's goals.

How many players wouldn't be excited to hear they would be playing on the same field as such a player?

Jules Kaimbe also felt a sense of anticipation.

"Do you know? Park Minho was the most positive about signing you. If it weren't for him, we might have signed someone else."

"Really?"

Though he didn't know what Park Minho saw in him, Jules resolved to work hard at Arsenal.

After a brief introduction to the coaching staff and players, Jules Kaimbe joined the Arsenal players for training.

Park Minho stayed by his side, helping him adjust to Arsenal.

Jules was in awe of Park Minho's overwhelming skills.

'His athletic ability is among the best in the EPL, and his technique is flawless. How can anyone stop a player like that?'

No, there was no need to think like a wingback anymore.

Jules shook his head.

He now had to change his position to a winger.

Honestly, he lacked confidence.

He was already struggling as a wingback, and if he failed to adapt as a winger, he felt he might not want to play football anymore.

Finally, it was time to start a mini-game as a winger.

The position felt a bit awkward.

It was hard to grasp the fact that he would always be fixed in such a high position.

The field felt strangely new.

At that moment, he saw Park Minho grabbing the ball on the opposite wing and quickly advancing.

Though slightly slower than himself, Park Minho was an overwhelming player in every other aspect.

'I don't have the excellent technique like Minho... Can I really perform as a winger?'

Worry came first.

Honestly, his prolonged slump at Southampton had greatly diminished his confidence.

Then the ball reached him.

Jules Kaimbe grabbed the ball and sprinted quickly.

Even by simply kicking the ball forward and running, no one could catch up to him.

Defenders were soon left behind.

But the real problem always came after he passed them.

Clumsy crosses and passes.

This time was no different.

After confidently passing the defender, his clumsy cross drew regretful looks from some of Arsenal's coaches.

Jules Kaimbe could feel it.

That he was just as ineffective as a winger.

At that moment, Park Minho approached.

He patted him on the back and asked,

"That wasn't a bad cross, but why did you cross at that timing?"

"What?"

"I mean, wouldn't it have been better to go deeper and take a shot? Your kicking power seems pretty impressive."

Jules Kaimbe wore a blank expression at those words.

'Shooting' was an option he had never considered while playing football.

Honestly, as a wingback, Jules had only focused on crossing and passing.

He thought it would bring better results for his career and believed he lacked in those areas.

Moreover, a player who couldn't even pass or cross well trying to shoot would only invite more criticism.

So, shooting wasn't an option for him, but Park Minho, smiling slyly in front of him, asked why he didn't take a shot.

Feeling like his football was being denied, Jules simultaneously felt a change in his football mindset.

"Defenders marking you would think this: 'It's easy because this guy doesn't shoot. As long as we block his crosses and passes, we can handle him.'"

"I think that's why your feeble crosses and passes are more easily read."

Jules had no words to say in response.

At the same time, he felt like he could see a path.

- Should I try shooting next time after passing a defender instead of crossing or passing?

With that thought, Jules Kaimbe returned to his spot with a contemplative expression.

* * *

Seeing it in person, I understand now.

His play is too simple.

He just breaks through and sends crosses and passes.

There are no deep penetrations, shots, or small plays with one-twos.

Despite this, what I felt while watching Jules Kaimbe was, "Indeed, physicality plays a huge role in sports!"

His feet were so fast that no one could stop him, even with simple penetrations.

Even Arsenal's most defensive fullback, Kamiyas, was thoroughly beaten by his straightforward breakthroughs.

As he started taking shots as I advised, his play definitely began to come alive.

"Just... even if he recklessly goes in and shoots, he'd still be doing his part. How are we supposed to stop that?"

Watching Jules Kaimbe dribble in and take a shot from the half-space, defender Daniel Saliba shook his head in disdain.

Of course, apart from that, Jules Kaimbe was clearly a player with many flaws.

But if you asked whether he was unusable, I would definitely say no.

He undoubtedly had talent that would work in the EPL, with his simple yet destructive dribbling and shooting abilities.

However, what our coach will decide to do with him is unknown to me... Honestly, isn't it a waste to leave a player with such speed and decent kicking power idle?

Thud!

Though it was just a goal scored in a mini-game during training, Jules Kaimbe, tasting his first goal, shouted in an excited voice.

"Yeahhhhh!"

Truly... a beastly movement.

With a bit more technical improvement, he would undoubtedly become a recognized winger in the EPL.

Judging by our coach's satisfied nods, it seemed Jules Kaimbe's position switch to a winger had passed the initial test.

Moreover, our team now had two beastly players.

Jules Kaimbe and Amani Richards.

On the days they played together, it seemed the opposing fullbacks would have a hard time.

Right Kaimbe, left Amani.

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to compare them to right Bale, left Traore.

Wow... This is crazy.

I should pray for the opposing fullbacks in advance.

"Hallelujah."

* * *

Pedro Ocampos transferred.

During the time Jules Kaimbe was signed, other clubs seemed to be having a quiet winter.

There were no major transfer news, nor were there many rumors.

Well... The most plausible news I heard was that Real Madrid was targeting Bernard Party, but he didn't seem to have any intention of leaving Arsenal.

If he were to leave, it would be in the summer.

He wouldn't want to leave in the middle of a season where Arsenal had a chance to lift the trophy for the first time in a long while.

Anyway.

Jules Kaimbe gradually integrated into the team.

Though he still caused the coaches to pull their hair out at the training ground, he was visibly learning and growing.

In this context, we won the first leg of the League Cup semi-final against Southampton with a 2-0 victory.

It was a decent performance.

Although I didn't score, I was satisfied since the team won 2-0.

In the following FA Cup third-round match.

Amani Richards, perhaps feeling competitive due to Jules Kaimbe's arrival, scored a hat-trick and led the team to victory.

The score was 8-0.

Gillingham suffered a 'humiliating defeat,' not only in terms of performance but also in score.

Then came the second leg of the League Cup semi-final.

Jules Kaimbe joined the team.

His debut match at Arsenal and his first starting match as a winger were approaching.
