## 24. Qatar World Cup (4)

Honestly, even if we lost to the Netherlands in this match, there wouldn't have been many people criticizing our national team.

Of course, the defense line has been getting some flak.

It might be because defenders often get blamed even for minor mistakes, but the players who were responsible for the goals seemed rather relaxed.

Maybe they have already reached a state of enlightenment.

Anyway.

This time, the Netherlands is the strongest.

Although they were hit hard by Morocco.

I didn't think they would be careless for the second time in a row.

However, the atmosphere of the Netherlands seemed worse than expected.

The players are really the strongest in history.

But something seemed off, as the media hinted at some instability.

I initially ignored it because Don Balón was involved, which isn't very credible, but honestly, the two goals they conceded against Morocco were entirely tactical failures.

It wasn't the coach's fault, though.

Coach Louis van Gaal is a legendary manager.

No matter the issues, you cannot deny the career he has built.

However, the Netherlands was slightly shaking.

If South Korea could exploit this, there was a good chance we could overcome them.

[Louis van Gaal: "South Korea? I don't care much. There won't be mistakes like in the Morocco match."]

[Virgil van Dijk: "South Korea has a top-level attack. We need to be really well prepared."]

It seemed there was a difference of opinion between the players and the coach.

Perhaps because Louis van Gaal is so straightforward and uncompromising, his relationship with journalists and players wasn't very good.

Well, that's a good opportunity for us.

Since the Netherlands is shaking.

We should persistently dig into that part.

The problem is, we are also a bit shaky.

To be precise, journalists were clinging to our coach like hyenas, trying to shake him.

[National team defense is non-existent! This is the current reality of the national team.]

[A defender with no basic skills as a national team player? South Korea's football relies solely on Shin Junseo and Park Minho.]

[South Korea must properly develop players other than attackers! Can they build a decent defense before Shin Junseo and Park Minho retire?]

[Coach Pedro’s indecisive judgment led to poor results.]

Honestly, our coach has been unfairly criticized.

Some key players who were expected to be starters got injured or couldn't regain their form after injury and haven't played properly for about a year.

Teamwork is important.

But still, players need to have some level of performance for teamwork to work, and players who lost in the competition for starting spots and took a year-long break due to injury were in bad shape.

He must have thought it would be much better to select young, promising players and give them experience.

I could understand why Coach Pedro made such a choice.

And that choice was correct.

Young players who experienced the matches against Morocco and France showed gradual improvement in training.

Seeing the young players grow day by day was truly noticeable.

Though maybe not this World Cup, I was confident that these players would be the core of the next World Cup.

That didn't mean we would take it easy in the last match of Group H against the Netherlands.

Even if we look forward to the next World Cup, it can’t be a reason to give up this World Cup.

Yes, we should at least make it to the Round of 16, shouldn't we?

* * *

For an Asian country facing a strong European team, the basic strategy has to be 'defense.'

But we can't just sit back.

Just like how Japan next door focused on defense against Uruguay and got beaten 4-0, South Korea would also get thoroughly beaten if we only focused on defense against the Netherlands.

Coach Pedro was worried.

He thought that South Korea's defense was weaker than expected, while their attack was comparable to strong European teams.

So, should South Korea leverage its current strengths?

Or should they suppress their strengths and focus on defense to at least aim for a draw?

It was a difficult choice.

In the end, Coach Pedro chose the 'attacking football' that South Korea had been playing until now.

Of course, it wasn't the 'possession football' shown against other teams.

Coach Pedro indeed wanted the team to build up play from the center over a long period.

He asked the players to maintain possession and build up play from the center for a really long time.

But.

With the central midfielders and attackers who were influenced by Pedro's tactics out due to injury, he didn't think there was a need to stick to central build-up play.

'Yes, our midfield organization is a mess anyway, and the Netherlands knows the central-oriented football I like to play.'

Coach Pedro thought.

So then, what are the strengths of the South Korean team?

And what tactics would be effective?

Coach Pedro pondered.

And pondered again.

In the end, it came down to Shin Junseo and Park Minho.

After all, it was those two.

As he watched the South Korean team slowly enter the field, Coach Pedro swallowed hard.

For those two players, he even put his pride aside.

He trusted those two players who were not bound by his tactics.

He fervently prayed.

That his choice was not a mistake.

* * *

Players in orange uniforms.

Indeed, the term 'Orange Army' suits them.

Yes, that's the Netherlands.

Virgil van Dijk, Matthijs de Ligt, Frenkie de Jong, and so on... the players who dominate the current football scene caught my eye.

*Beep!*

The referee blew the whistle, and the match started.

The Netherlands was indeed different.

I felt a massive wall, similar to what I felt against France, which was a bit overwhelming.

-The Netherlands starts to press South Korea hard from the beginning of the match.

-As expected, the Netherlands seems to be taking the initiative early in the match.

I noticed Matthijs de Ligt glaring at me.

As I moved to the side, he looked at me with an expression that said, 'I've got you this time!'

"I'll completely block you this time."

Was it wrong to do the 'Siu' celebration?

When I shrugged my shoulders, he frowned even more.

Well, just as Juventus and the Netherlands are different, so are Parma and South Korea.

So I quietly ignored de Ligt's words and prowled between the defenders like a hyena.

There was still a lot of time left.

Surprisingly, South Korea's defenders were holding off the Netherlands' attacks well.

It seemed to be an issue with the attacking tactics, as Memphis Depay was handling the attack alone, and Alex Berghuis, receiving passes from him, missed several good opportunities, leading to a failed offensive.

At the same time, South Korea launched a counterattack.

I was a bit surprised that Coach Pedro adopted a counter-attacking tactic utilizing the flanks.

It meant he abandoned his tactical philosophy of insisting on building up play from the center.

Thanks to that, I was at ease.

All I had to do was switch from the center to the flanks, run to catch a long pass, and then what?

Bang!

I would send a long pass to the center, and Junseo hyung would receive it and quickly run into the danger zone of the Netherlands.

Kick and rush.

The football that Coach Pedro, who values possession, brought out was England's kick and rush.

-Shin Junseooooooo!

-Oooooh! A narrowly missed shot! Finally, South Korea records their first shot a little over 10 minutes into the first half!

Junseo hyung gave me a thumbs-up after evading Virgil van Dijk and taking a shot.

I also gave him a thumbs-up, feeling that the match atmosphere wasn't bad.

At the same time, a cheeky thought came to mind.

That I had to solve today's match myself.

Just like I did at Parma.

Alright, let's focus on the match again.

The form of Matthijs de Ligt, who was sticking to me like a leech throughout the match, wasn't as good as I thought.

If not for Frenkie de Jong's coverage, we would have had a perfect chance.

Their specific weaknesses kept showing.

When South Korea's attack, which has the great advantage of speed, kept poking, they were significantly shaken.

The fast counterattack, which de Ligt's slow feet couldn't keep up with, shook the Netherlands.

If not for van Dijk blocking everything.

If not for that, South Korea might have been leading 1-0 against the Netherlands.

In fact, considering de Ligt's large build, he isn't that slow.

He just has weaknesses in directional change and acceleration, but once his speed picks up, he has shown that he can even catch up with Mbappe.

-The Netherlands! They've found an opportunity!

-Memphis Depayyyyy! Goooooal!

-Ah! South Korea! They were holding off well, but they conceded a goal in the 27th minute of the first half!

Finally, a goal was conceded.

The scorer was Memphis Depay.

As he did at Barcelona, he swiftly broke in, exchanged passes with another player, made a clean cut, and took a shot.

Song Minjae threw his body, but.

The ball had already shaken the net.

* * *

"Great!"

"This is it! This is it!"

Dutch fans clenched their fists and rejoiced at the fantastic goal.

How dare an Asian team, a football backwater, think of defeating the Netherlands?

Seeing South Korea, which couldn't even cross the halfway line and barely surviving through counterattacks, finally conceding a goal, they laughed brightly.

Opposite them, seeing the wailing Red Devils of South Korea, they sang their support songs even louder.

But it was only for a while.

Not long after scoring the first goal, a long pass was made, and a player who caught the ball on the flank showed a play that surprised everyone, breaking through the Netherlands' flank.

"Who is that player again?"

"Did South Korea have such a player?"

Some spectators who came to Doha for the World Cup festivities without much prior interest in football were there.

Even those who knew football well but had their own domestic leagues rarely watched Serie A.

In their eyes, Park Minho was a new player.

Even those who knew of him thought he was just a player who scored a few goals.

Of course, hardcore Dutch football fans who watched Serie A shouted nervously as they looked at Park Minho.

"Damn it! Stop him! Stop that damn devil!"

"South Korea doesn't just have 'Shin'! They have 'Minho' too! Damn van Gaal!"

"The flank is getting broken again!"

"Too fast! De Ligt can't keep up!"

An attacker who caught the interest of big clubs from the four major leagues.

The most destructive attacker in current Serie A.

That was Park Minho.

-Park Minho! Park Minho! Waaaaah!

-He broke through! He overcame it! Virgil van Dijk is trying to push him away! But he doesn't fall!

-Park Minho! Shooooots! Goooooooal! Park Minho's equalizing gooooooal!

-A fantastic curved shot shakes the net!

Park Minho, who didn't get pushed back even by van Dijk's marking, broke through and finally scored.

Naturally, Dutch fans held their heads in their hands.

"Damn it!"

"What the hell is happening?"

"It's 1-1 again? Suddenly?"

Park Minho, who became a free wolf along with Shin Junseo, played wildly with the ball.

A normal player would have happily turned over the ball and collapsed, but Park Minho was a completely different player.

-The Netherlands is shaking!

-Frenkie de Jong quickly blocks in front of Park Minho! But Park Minho is relentless!

-A fantastic La Croqueta! Park Minho! He breaks through! Fast! Fast! Fast!

-The Dutch defense is getting busy!

-This is it! Today's performance suits South Korea much better than the match against France!

"Waaaaah! Stop! Stop it!"

"Someone stop that damn number 10!"

"Van Dijk! Please! Please!"

Amidst the cries of Dutch fans.

Park Minho finally drew a foul close to the goal, earning a free-kick at the end of the first half.

The first half had ended, and only a little extra time remained.

Dutch fans clasped their hands tightly and prayed as they watched Park Minho and Shin Junseo slowly take their positions in front of the ball.

Please make a mistake.

Please end the first half like this.

But their prayers were not answered.

After calmly adjusting his posture, Park Minho lightly stepped forward and kicked the ball.

The ball drew a beautiful curve and directly shook the Dutch net.

-Goooooooal!

-Park Minhooooo! A brace today! South Korea now leads 2-1!

-We can do it! We can do it!

The expressions of the Dutch players who conceded a goal at the end of the first half were not good.

Thus ended the first half.

Just as the fierce first half had been, the second half was expected to be a tough battle where both sides would clash.

But everyone was surprised by the substitution cards that Coach Pedro played after halftime.

-Coach Pedro makes two substitutions as soon as the second half starts.

-He takes out Park Yongcheol and Lee Jooho, and puts in Lee Daeseong and Baek Seungjae, replacing the two young players who ran a lot in the first half with two veteran players.

That was not the end.

With the substitutions, all the South Korean players except Shin Junseo and Park Minho dropped deep.

Even the lone striker Park Sangbin moved below the halfway line and focused on defense.

It was then that the Netherlands realized.

Why they had run so desperately in the first half.

Coach Louis van Gaal frowned.

These damn Koreans are really crazy.

He quickly changed tactics and called the warming-up attackers to look for a substitution timing.

But throughout the second half, the only flaw in the otherwise perfect Dutch team kept showing.

-This is the problem! The only lacking part of the otherwise perfect Dutch team is the lack of a sure striker who can convert perfect chances into goals!

-Time keeps ticking!

10 minutes into the second half.

Then 20 minutes.

Time kept ticking away.

Now it was the Netherlands who felt frustrated.

But they couldn't push their defensive line up too high.

When they pushed the line up, South Korea's single pass quickly exposed the backspace, leading to a crisis.

It was a scene that perfectly explained why South Korea had planted Shin Junseo and Park Minho at the forefront.

The possession rate started to reach 70:30.

But the Netherlands kept being penalized for their lack of a solid striker.

A tired Depay no longer had the energy to shake up South Korea's messy defense.

Despite this, he stayed at the forefront because there was no better attacker.

Thanks to that, the Dutch attack became even more sluggish.

Coach Louis van Gaal put in a flank player.

In his final move, he substituted Depay and put in another player to take a chance.

But in the remaining time.

It was the Netherlands who conceded another goal.

-Park Minhooooooo!

-Hat-trick! Hat-trick! Park Minhooooo! In the 41st minute of the second half, Park Minho scores a clinching goal!

-South Korea secures a definite victory with a 3-1 lead!

The Dutch defense, which missed a perfect opportunity, finally lost Park Minho.

Park Minho did not miss the chance, bypassed De Ligt, and ran straight to score a goal.

Not only did Coach Louis van Gaal's face harden, but the camera also captured Dutch fans in tears.

Finally, the match ended with the referee's whistle.

*Beep! Beep! Beeeeeep!*

It was an unbelievable result.

The Netherlands, shocked by the outcome of the match.

With today's defeat, they were eliminated from the World Cup.

* * *

The results of Group H came out.

[Qatar World Cup Group H]

1, France 2 wins 1 loss

2, South Korea 2 wins 1 loss

3, Netherlands 1 win 2 losses

4, Morocco 1 win 2 losses

France secured a 6-1 victory over Morocco, making the goal difference between France and South Korea equal, but South Korea dropped to 2nd place due to fewer goals scored.

But that wasn't a big concern.

There were only articles celebrating our advancement to the Round of 16.

[Park Minho: "The Netherlands! Losing to a strong team is not something to be ashamed of. South Korea is strong enough to make it to the Round of 16."]

[Miracle! The proud Taeguk Warriors advance to the Round of 16 in an away World Cup for the first time since 2010!]

[Park Minho's hat-trick leads the team to the Round of 16!]

[South Korea's different strategy from the previous two matches! Breaks down the Netherlands with ten players in defense and counter-attacks on the flanks!]

[Coach Louis van Gaal: "This is not football."]

[Comments]

-LOL Netherlands! Losing to a strong team is not something to be ashamed of! I never imagined I'd hear this in an interview LMAO

-Park Minho, this bastard LOL he's subtly savage LOL

-Wow... We made it to the Round of 16? We advanced from a group with France, the Netherlands, and Morocco in 2nd place?

South Korea, which defeated the strong Netherlands with a 3-1 score thanks to Park Minho's hat-trick.

But what awaited South Korea, which defeated the Netherlands, was the European football powerhouse 'Spain.'

-Who's the next opponent?

-Spain LOL

-This smells like the ending of North High...

-Well, I'm satisfied just making it to the Round of 16 LOL

-Really... Park Minho is crazy. Shin Junseo is amazing too... But Park Minho is on a different level.

-His goal-scoring sense is insane LOL

-There's a reason he's the 2nd top scorer in Serie A.

And South Korean fans started to raise their expectations, looking at 'Park Minho' again.

Hoping that he would show another miracle this time.
