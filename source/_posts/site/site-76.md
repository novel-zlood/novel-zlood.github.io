## 27. At the Fork in the Road (2)

We've already met Inter for the fourth time.

That means it's easy to feel a certain internal familiarity.

Interestingly, unlike other strong teams, it seemed Inter's fans didn't dislike me that much.

Well, since I scored and provoked against Juventus and AC Milan, they might have felt a refreshing coolness, like drinking a cold soda from afar.

Anyway.

As the match against Inter approached, the training ground was filled with tension and anticipation.

It meant that winning here would bring us very close to the championship.

Naturally, the young players' faces were quite flushed.

Honestly, even I started to feel a bit of anticipation for the championship, so it was understandable that those young players felt the same.

Whether this atmosphere would work positively for the team or create a negative flow, I didn't know.

After all, I'm still a second-year "newbie" pro.

Honestly, my professional period is shorter than those young guys, so how could I be as confident as a veteran?

Well, the veterans participated in the training with their usual expressions, but they were surely feeling the pressure and anticipation as well.

I mean, even our veteran leader Marjan made a ridiculous mistake.

And it happened during training.

Still, I didn't think it was a problem.

Who are we?

We were a team that achieved an undefeated promotion in Serie B, even if it's a step lower.

Seeing how I'm rambling, honestly, I might be a bit nervous too.

Yeah, if we can overcome this fork in the road, it means Parma truly deserves to be the protagonist of a fairy tale.

Isn't that so?

* * *

Coach Alain had to look far ahead.

That's how it is for a coach.

While others were worrying and preparing for the immediate match, he had to prepare for the distant future more than anyone.

That's what a football coach is.

And that's why a football coach is called a "manager."

Honestly, Parma had no room until March.

Starting with the match against Inter, then Bilbao, Roma, Napoli, and continuing into early April with a match against Milan, it was truly a hellish schedule.

“Damn World Cup.”

So he prepared.

He frequently rotated players from the beginning of the season.

And he was now seeing the results of that.

Of course, because of that, they lost to Genoa, and were defeated in the Super Cup final...

But that wasn't a big problem.

Thanks to those losses, none of Parma's main players had collapsed from fatigue or injury yet.

This was also a blessing for Parma.

Park Minho was playing almost like an iron man, and other players were holding up well without minor injuries until mid-February.

This despite the World Cup being in the middle of the schedule.

Though a few veterans got injured, Coach Alain had somewhat expected that, so it wasn't a problem.

But the news that followed put a crack in the face of Coach Alain, who was like the omnipotent Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty."

[Parma's right winger Fabian Pavone! Out for 2 weeks!]

One of the wingers who quietly did his part on the right side was injured before the Inter match.

There was a backup, Dennis Man, but the skill gap between the two was quite significant.

Last season, Fabian Pavone's advantage that pushed Dennis Man, who was a main winger in Serie B, was his consistency.

He was a player who consistently showed above-average performance against any team.

With such a player out.

Naturally, Coach Alain's expression hardened.

The only relief was that Dennis Man's form had been improving recently.

"Hoo... This was predictable. We can overcome it! We can do it!"

"I am a great coach. I am a great coach. I am a great coach."

"I am the world-renowned coach, Alain Levagne!"

As Coach Alain muttered to himself, he sensed something strange and looked at the door of the coach's office.

There stood Park Minho with an awkward expression, holding a cake, and behind him, other players were holding a small placard that read, "Coach! Happy Birthday!"

"......"

"......"

A brief silence followed.

Park Minho carefully closed the door of the coach's office.

Then, after a moment, he knocked and opened the door wide, shouting.

"Coach! Happy Birthday!"

Park Minho's awkward acting.

Coach Alain smiled sadly.

His awkward acting felt even sadder.

"Oh! Was it my birthday? Hahaha!"

And the really sad news was that this scene was being live-streamed on Parma's YouTube channel.

* * *

The crowd filled the Ennio Tardini.

Parma's home fans were passionately singing their support songs.

How would Inter's players feel walking onto the field hearing this support?

I think they would react indifferently.

That's how I felt at Inter's home.

Inter.

It really feels like we meet often.

Of course, it's only four matches, and I didn't even step on the field in the Italian Super Cup, so in a way, this is my third meeting with Inter.

It's a good team.

They always have the strength to aim for the championship.

Even though Inter's fans are angry and frustrated with their Chinese owner, the situation is better than other Chinese-owned clubs.

Moreover, Inter's coach is gradually achieving results, so it's not surprising that the club is expected to have a promising future.

Back to our team, seeing the expressions of our players entering the field, they seemed a bit nervous.

Despite having played against Inter many times, today they seemed to place a lot of significance on this match.

Well, it's not just any match... It’s a crucial match for getting one step closer to winning Serie A.

The feeling is bound to be different from other matches.

I can understand that.

Honestly, I'm a bit nervous too.

"Hey, Minho!"

Inter's ace calling me.

I looked at Lautaro Martinez.

He spoke with a confident voice.

"Don't be too disappointed if we win today's match."

What kind of nonsense is this?

Honestly, I was a bit dumbfounded.

If he's showing this confidence because they won the Super Cup, I'd be a bit disappointed.

Ignoring him, I turned my head, hearing Lautaro's confident laughter.

Seeing such a confident opponent makes me feel a bit heated.

Of course, we could lose.

You never know in football.

As the football is round, the outcome can always change, and I know that well.

But seeing such a confident opponent makes me want to win even more, making my heart itch.

Ah, the little kid inside me whispers.

Let's show these overconfident guys some proper payback.

But.

Football is round.

I had no choice but to halt the lesson aimed at Inter.

-Ah! Dennis Man is down holding his ankle!

-It looks like a serious injury?

-While competing with Riccardo Di Marco... Ah! Both players collided heavily!

-Both Riccardo Di Marco and Dennis Man are being carried off the field.

I could see our self-proclaimed world-renowned coach clutching his head in despair.

There was no player to run on the right side.

I couldn't be placed on the wing either because it would be a significant minus in terms of attack.

But what could we do?

There was no other way.

Our coach looked at me and nodded.

'Minho... What can we do... We've come this far...'

His eyes seemed to say.

I gave him a gentle smile in return.

Like my favorite baseball player.

'I'll give it a try!'

I sent a look that roughly conveyed this meaning.

-Due to the early injuries of both players, both teams quickly make substitutions.

-Parma brings in Genaro Tatis.

-Minho moves to the right wing... It seems Genaro Tatis will move to the front.

-On the other hand, Inter brings in Goran Perisic. It looks like they plan to be more aggressive on the wing.

Seeing me move to the right, Inter's defense seemed to let out a sigh of relief.

They seemed to think it would be easier to deal with me in this position than when I play up front.

Honestly, I found it much more comfortable and better to move on the wing.

Of course, having to contribute to defense made it harder to make significant contributions in attack.

But it wasn't a problem.

I planned to show today why I always arrived earlier and left later than anyone else.

"You say stamina is my weakness?"

That was a long time ago.

I'm the one who can now be called the iron man.

Even if not with two hearts, at least a man with 1.5 hearts, that's Park Minho.

* * *

Goran Perisic, who replaced Riccardo Di Marco, was full of confidence as he stepped onto the field.

He wasn't confident about defending against Minho, but at least he was confident in showing his prowess in attack against Parma.

'No matter how great Minho is... He can't be perfect in defense.'

So he might have been a bit complacent.

Because he tried to nutmeg Park Minho by pushing the ball through his legs and running past him.

But his attempt failed.

Instead, he lost the ball and had to hurriedly chase after Park Minho.

Minho's long cross connected with Kenes' head, but fortunately, goalkeeper Trigueirau made a save, avoiding a goal.

However, Goran Perisic had to endure harsh scolding from the usually kind coach Gino Nzaghi.

“Damn it...”

Yes, this mistake was caused by his complacency.

The only relief was that they didn't concede a goal due to this complacency.

Goran Perisic pulled himself together.

This time, he resolved to break through Park Minho and prove his worth by scoring.

'Yes, this mistake came from being too complacent.'

How can you call yourself Inter's wingback if you can't even break through one striker?

He regained his composure and demanded the ball.

Receiving the ball from Pietro Barella, he slowly dribbled and stood in front of Park Minho.

'This time, it's different!'

Yes, this time, it's different.

With a natural upper body feint, he deceived Park Minho and turned to the opposite side, running forward.

'Got through!'

Thinking he had definitely broken through Park Minho, Goran Perisic tried to run forward with all his might.

Crash!

With a strong impact, he fell to the field.

"Ouch!"

Surprised by the strong impact, Goran Perisic quickly looked for the referee.

But the referee signaled for the game to continue.

It meant it was a fair challenge.

At the same time, Park Minho, who had penetrated the now-empty wing, showed a precise inswing shot reminiscent of Robben's trademark move.

Thud!

-Gooooooal!

-Minhooo! A fantastic curling shot from him after a long time!

-The side was quickly breached! The gap created by Goran Perisic losing the physical battle with Minho was exploited by Parma!

Goran Perisic, looking blankly at Park Minho, soon denied the reality.

'Yes, today's referee seems to allow a bit rough physical play.'

He blamed the conceded goal on the referee.

It couldn't be helped.

He thought the physical challenge just now wasn't fair.

But.

After failing two more attempts to break through, Goran Perisic had no choice but to realize.

That monster wasn't just good at attacking.

He was also a competent defender.

-Minhooo! Another clean tackle to take the ball from Goran Perisic!

-Goran Perisic looking very powerless today! He needs to get his head together! Goran Perisic!

"Damn it."

Thinking he was really screwed as he lost the ball to Park Minho's clean tackle, leading to a counterattack opportunity, Goran Perisic muttered.
