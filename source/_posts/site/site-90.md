## 33. Display of Skills (2)

“Hmm…”

Assistant Coach Matteo let out a short sigh as he watched the training.

The movements were satisfactory enough, but the players' teamwork was strangely off.

Players nearby, noticing this, ran even harder.

Most of them were backup players, but they were closer to being starters this season than anyone else.

Especially among the midfielders, the competition was fierce due to the influx of new players, making it uncertain who would become a starter.

However, the forwards seemed somewhat deflated.

Apart from Lorenzo Lupo and Park Minho, it felt like Tyler Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka, Pedro Ocampos, and Gabriel Martinelli were competing for the remaining spot.

Naturally, the young forwards felt a sense of resignation.

They lacked the confidence to break through and secure a starting position against such great players.

As a result, they showed a lackluster performance during training, catching the critical eyes of Coach Alain and Assistant Coach Matteo.

In a negative sense, that is.

“It would be best to send Miles out on loan.”

“He's fallen into a rut. Sending him to a team where he can reasonably be a starter might fix it.”

At least there was confidence that the young 19-year-old striker Miles could develop his mentality and potential through a loan.

Though his face showed a lack of enthusiasm, he didn't show a loss of focus during training.

But there was a bigger problem with another player.

“Let's sell Amani this winter.”

“He's different from Miles; his biggest issue is definitely his mentality.”

“I can understand Miles. If Minho hadn't come this season, he could've been in the lineup as a backup forward. It's understandable that he's disappointed.”

Coach Alain nodded in agreement with Assistant Coach Matteo's words.

“But not Amani. He's lacking in skill and has a terrible mentality.”

“Plus, he's lazy.”

“Exactly. If nothing else, you can't rehabilitate a lazy player.”

This was Assistant Coach Matteo's philosophy.

No matter how talented a player is, if they're lazy, there's no point in trying to develop them.

“As expected! It's Amani!”

“Wow… His talent is really insane.”

“How can he score a goal like that?”

Amani's genius was evident even in practice, astonishing other players.

“Hola! Hola!”

Assistant Coach Matteo frowned as he watched Amani dance excitedly in front of the teammates he had just outplayed.

But a genius who is both arrogant and lazy is impossible to rehabilitate.

Of course, it wasn't entirely hopeless.

“I wonder how he'll react to Minho.”

“He didn't show much reaction during training.”

“Of course… It's all about the actual game.”

“Exactly.”

A friendly match against Celtic.

Coach Alain thought.

He hoped that in Arsenal's first preseason game, the arrogant and lazy genius Amani Richards would learn a lesson.

A lesson about how serious and desperate Park Minho is about the sport called football.

* * *

Amani's talent is real.

Just like how I was amazed by Joshua's pass.

Amani's dribbling breakthroughs were more dazzling than anyone else's.

“You'll regret it later.”

“Minho! With this level of talent, I can afford to slack off a bit!”

The problem is that he's lazy and full of arrogance.

Hmm… Who would be a good comparison?

You could say he's like Ahmed Traore, with Balotelli's arrogance and Romário's laziness.

Ahmed Traore, who transferred from Wolves to Barcelona and then loaned to Napoli last winter, had dribbling skills more destructive than mine.

Amani Richards has even more potential than Ahmed Traore.

The problem is that despite having such explosive speed and dribbling skills, he's lacking in other areas.

Even though he could improve further, he lives lazily, relying only on his dribbling.

I can tell.

He'll regret it later.

For now, he can frequently showcase such feats because he has fantastic technique and explosive physicality, but as he ages, he will undoubtedly fall behind.

His explosive breakthroughs will lose their power.

Even his prized dribbling will increasingly be read by defenders and easily become prey.

Even Ahmed Traore, who survived at Barcelona, learned to cross and cut back to a decent level.

Yet, he still got pushed out of the starting lineup and loaned to Napoli.

“Running excessively puts a strain on my knees, so I tried to avoid it… But I have no choice.”

To show that arrogant and lazy kid what real talent is, I'll have to run like a madman.

Even though I transferred to Arsenal for a lot of money, shouldn't I at least lift one trophy at Arsenal?

Yes, I have a desire for honor too.

If I can rehabilitate that kid even a little, it would be a small help to the team, wouldn't it?

That's what I think.

Yes, in the end, being a pro means proving yourself with skills.

So I have to show them.

Whether that arrogant kid will come to his senses after seeing my skills is uncertain, but at least other players will definitely feel something when they see my skills.

And this friendly match against Celtic is a great stage to showcase my skills.

The match held at Celtic Park.

I played as the left-wing forward in a 4-3-3 formation.

The 4-3-3 formation was something I had some experience with during my time at Parma.

It seemed that Coach Alain intended to use the 4-3-3 formation mainly at Arsenal.

Indeed, a four-back system suits the current Arsenal better than a three-back system.

The first actual match.

Lorenzo Lupo looked at me with a face full of anticipation, and the right-wing forward Tyler Smith Rowe was talking to central midfielder Axel Ødegaard.

Before entering the game.

Bruno Campos assured me, “If you show even half of what you did in Serie A, Arsenal fans will call you a god.”

Even though you're a newcomer like me, why are you acting like an old-timer at Arsenal?

Besides, isn't it a bit much to call someone a god for such performance?

Anyway.

The starting lineup for the first half was mostly composed of main players.

Celtic seemed to have a similar approach.

They planned to observe the cohesion of the starting players in the first half and make large substitutions in the second half to check the form of the backup players.

Beep!

With the referee's whistle, the match began.

Lorenzo Lupo, positioned at the forefront, passed the ball back, giving Arsenal the first attack.

The first goal was created effortlessly.

Lorenzo Lupo's pass landed perfectly as I broke through the disorganized Celtic defense, and I didn't miss the perfect opportunity.

Even though an opposing side defender grabbed my uniform, the ball I curved at a delicate angle went straight into the goal, successfully scoring easily.

It was a routine goal.

Since the opponent wasn't a top-tier Serie A team, it was even easier to score.

Besides, it was a friendly match, so the cohesion was noticeably lacking.

Of course, that was the same for Arsenal.

The only reason Arsenal didn't concede like Celtic was due to the incredible activity and defensive skills of the newly signed Marco Torreira.

“Nice cover!”

Marlon Ramsdale, who had suffered from Arsenal's clumsy central defenders throughout training, smiled brightly as he ruffled Marco Torreira's hair.

His smile was so wide it seemed his lips reached his ears.

Marlon Ramsdale clapped and encouraged the young 20-year-old defender Craig Martin.

He was having a positive influence on the team, replacing Tyrone Tierney, who was hard to communicate with on the flank.

The second goal came from a pattern play directed by Coach Alain.

I realized that this second goal, created through teamwork, was more valuable than the first goal, which Lorenzo and I made using our individual skills.

Coach Alain clenched his fist and celebrated immensely.

Arsenal attacked in a modified three-back formation with Kamiyas moving to the center and Tyrone Tierney advancing high.

In defense, Marco Torreira dropped down to the backline, forming a five-back, which surprisingly stabilized the defense against Celtic.

Tyrone Tierney's offensive involvement gave me the momentum to move centrally, and Tyler Smith Rowe acted as a linker, delivering and passing the ball to me and Lorenzo in the center.

Lorenzo and I moved freely in the free-role, utilizing Tyler's movements and passes, whether by following the team's basic pattern or taking our desired movements freely.

Of course, it wasn't a perfectly smooth tactic.

Since the tactic relied on Lorenzo and me to finish the attack, it would undoubtedly show a somewhat frustrating offensive power if either one of us was absent.

Despite such shortcomings, there was only one reason why Arsenal used this tactic.

It was simply destructive.

I guarantee, I could score more goals than during my time at Parma.

As the opponent's pressure increased, the tempo began to rise rapidly.

Players from other leagues usually cite the relentless pace of the Premier League as the main reason they struggle to adapt.

I agree with that opinion.

These guys move without thinking.

Not in a bad way, but they move without thinking in a good way.

Celtic, aware of this, tried to control the game by possessing the ball longer and dragging it into their rhythm.

However.

The cost of wearing an awkward suit was too fatal.

Thud!

Seeing me score a hat-trick in an instant, Lorenzo, who had assisted twice today, smiled brightly.

“Damn! This is it! This beautiful combination play is why I wanted to play football!”

Anyway.

The first half ended with a score of 3-0.

There were no more goals, but overall, Arsenal's main players overwhelmed Celtic's main players.

After halftime, as the second half began, most of the main players from both teams were substituted.

For Arsenal, everyone except me and Ramsdale was substituted, while Celtic substituted everyone except their main midfielder and three forwards.

In Lorenzo's place was Gabriel Martinelli.

In Tyler Smith Rowe's place was the problematic kid 'Amani Richards.'

He moved with a confident expression.

The breathtaking breakthrough in the second minute of the second half was enough to shake Celtic's defense.

But that was 'all' Amani Richards showed in today's match until the second minute of the second half.

“Aaah!”

Celtic, known for their rough play in the Scottish League, handled the fast Amani Richards roughly.

“Ref! This is too rough!”

Amani protested to the referee.

But the referee didn't even glance at him.

That's why I advised him to do some weight training and develop other skills.

If he were as muscular as Ahmed Traore, he wouldn't have faced such humiliation.

Anyway.

With Arsenal's backup players on the field, the match turned completely different, and they started getting beaten by Celtic.

Thud!

“Alright!”

“Let's catch up slowly!”

Celtic's first goal, which came in the 10th minute of the second half, began from Amani Richards' turnover.

Knowing this or not, our wild horse complained with a dissatisfied expression.

“If I had been able to break through a bit more comfortably, it would have been a goal... The backup was late…”

He looked resentfully at Liam Murray, the newly joined midfielder.

During the brief cooling break.

I approached our problematic kid, who was grumbling, and cleared the crap from his head with a punch of justice.

Thud!

“Ouch!”

“It’s the fist of justice.”

“Minho! Why did you hit me?”

Why? To show the dribbling maniac who can't come to his senses what real dribbling is.

“Amani.”

“What?”

“Watch closely. This is real talent.”

Amani looked at me with eyes that said, "Minho, are you crazy?"

Wait and see.

I’ll show you for real.

As the cooling break ended and the game resumed.

I positioned myself wide on the flank and demanded a pass from Liam Murray.

Thump!

As soon as I got the ball, the opposing side defender tensed up, and I increased my speed.

Though the Celtic defender tried to engage in a physical battle, I broke free with even greater speed.

Honestly, Celtic's defense was rougher than Inter’s, but they lacked the skill to stop an attacker.

I pushed him hard with my shoulder and ran forward, causing the Celtic defender to fall with a cry.

But the referee judged it as a fair physical battle and signaled for play to continue.

Seeing me penetrate deeper, another Celtic defender rushed, and I swiftly outpaced him with a burst of speed, followed by a flip-flap to bypass the subsequent defender.

With three Celtic defenders left in the dust in an instant.

I glanced at the advancing Celtic goalkeeper and chipped the ball over.

Thump!

The ball subtly floated over the goalkeeper.

Simultaneously, I leaped over the goalkeeper and gently kicked the ball slowly rolling towards the empty goal.

Thud!

The field went silent.

Walking past the astonished Arsenal players, I said to the cheeky kid.

“If you can’t do this, give up on dribbling.”

Now, having heard such words.

What kind of reaction will this cheeky kid show?

I watched Amani Richards' face with a curious expression.
