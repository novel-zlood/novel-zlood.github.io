## 27. At the Fork in the Road (1)

"Perelle! Hahaha! You cute little thing! It's Bayern Munich! And Newcastle is also interested in you!"

His agent laughed brightly with joy.

This winter, Newcastle had contacted him.

Newcastle showed great interest in him, coaxing him with promises of a hefty weekly wage and ample support to help him adapt to the team if he transferred.

The agent was convinced.

He could make a fortune if he transferred this winter.

But Perelle had a different thought.

He felt he still wasn't enough.

"Yes, I'm still lacking."

Perelle Kanashini thought.

He believed he was lacking in many areas and could only barely hold his own if he worked hard.

His individual skills and dribbling were inferior to Park Minho.

His passing and ball control were outmatched by Joshua, his speed and natural physicality by Kenneth, and he wasn't particularly strong in defense or attack compared to other players.

He considered himself a small hexagonal player.

Thus, he wanted to learn a bit more.

He wanted to develop further at Parma.

But his agent thought differently.

"Perelle! I think Munich might do that. They see you as a rotation member."

"But Newcastle is different! They guarantee you a starting position and can ensure you play more games than anyone! It's a club with a solid foundation for growth!"

He recommended transferring to Newcastle.

Of course, the large sum of money he would receive played a part, but considering the stature of the club Newcastle and the enormous wealth and opportunities they offered Perelle, it wasn't a bad choice.

So he pondered.

Was it right to leave Parma?

Feeling his head clouded with distracting thoughts, he took a deep breath and quietly began to meditate.

At the young age of 19.

But Perelle was more mature than any other player.

This was largely thanks to Buddhism.

However.

The contemplation that began in early January continued until the end of the match against Genoa on January 30th.

Finally, the day to make a decision dawned.

Perelle quietly arrived early at the training ground.

He wanted to warm up early and clear his thoughts.

But he wasn't the first one at the training ground.

"Minho…."

The team's ace, Park Minho.

He was there warming up earlier than anyone else.

Seeing that, Perelle made his choice.

He decided to continue playing for Parma this season.

When he told his agent, he was disappointed but respected his decision.

While training, Perelle talked with Park Minho and came to admire him.

Despite his overwhelming performance, he never missed a day and was always the first to arrive.

He couldn't help but respect him.

Indeed, Buddha's words were true.

Human desires are all futile, like bubbles, phantoms, wild horses, and the moon reflected in water.

Erasing the large sum offered by Newcastle from his mind, he felt he knew which path to take.

Yes, if he didn't get greedy and improved his skills, opportunities would surely come eventually.

Perelle smiled brightly and nodded.

Then he expressed his gratitude to Park Minho.

"Minho! Thanks to you, I was able to escape my worries! Indeed, my heart is more important than money."

Watching this, Park Minho quietly muttered.

"Money is the best... Is he crazy?"

* * *

A few days after winning the match against Atalanta, our Coppa Italia semi-final opponent was decided.

AS Roma, ranked 8th in the league.

They were our next opponent in the Coppa Italia.

Oh, don't bother looking for Coach Martinho.

A few days ago.

He was dismissed after losing 3-2 to AC Milan.

Still, it was a bit heartbreaking to see the coach who led Roma to win the Europa Conference League last season not doing well.

He was strangely an interesting fellow.

It seemed he always had an unfortunate end.

In Korea, people exclaimed, "As expected, Martinho's third year!"

Indeed... a fascinating coach.

Although the next coach hasn't been decided yet.

There were rumors that the most likely candidate was Coach Andre Villas-Boas, but I'm not sure about that.

Now, back to the league, our next round opponent was Bologna.

Having faced Bologna once in the Coppa Italia, they seemed to harbor some hope seeing us lose to Genoa in the league.

Although we relieved some bad vibes with a victory in the Coppa Italia quarter-finals, we were still without consecutive league wins.

-RealMilan: Great! Only 5 points behind Parma!

-RealMilan: Let's go for the third consecutive league title!

-RealMilan: Inter! Inter! Inter!

With Inter closely trailing behind, some die-hard fans regained hope, and perhaps Bologna had similar thoughts.

-LoveMilano: Yes, you're going to perish miserably, hahaha.

-KingChampionJuve: Do you think Parma will easily give up first place?

-LoveMilano: Stacking up Inter again? Hahaha.

Well, as expected, our friends were happily teasing the die-hard Inter fans.

It was strange that Roberto was quiet.

He seemed to be overwhelmed with work lately, as he mentioned he felt like dying, so he didn't seem to have the energy to check the group chat.

Who told him to go watch the game in person when he was so busy?

It's all karma.

Oh, Monica said she's finishing up her piled-up schedule and preparing to return to Italy soon.

Indeed, when someone's presence is there and then gone, it feels lonely.

I also missed Monica's cooking.

I was curious about how Monica, whose mother is from England and who grew up in London, could cook Italian food so well...

Anyway.

Time passed, and on February 13th.

On the day of the away game against Bologna.

Parma arrived at Bologna's home, Renato Dall'Ara, and felt a bit puzzled by the unexpectedly soft opponent.

Honestly, an "away" game is a match played on the opponent's home turf, where anything can happen, and surprises can occur.

There's a reason why the saying "Even a wild dog gets half a meal at its home" exists.

The "home advantage" is not something to be taken lightly.

But Bologna's defense did not seem like a significant threat to us.

-Minho! Takes the ball and runs!

-He's fast! Turns around the flank and crosses it straight away!

-Kenneth header! Gooooooal!

-A header goal from Kenneth in the 19th minute of the first half!

The opening goal scored close to the 20th minute of the first half was enough to further dismantle Bologna's soft defense.

"Those guys aren't focusing properly."

I nodded at Santiago's words as he returned to his position.

"Indeed... they seem to lack concentration."

"The coach hasn't been dismissed, nor are they striking... something must be up within the team."

I quietly nodded at the slacker's words.

"That rumor seems to be true."

"Oh, the discord rumor?"

"If not, it doesn't make sense."

It seemed likely that there was indeed discord within the team.

Santiago nodded in agreement with my words.

"Definitely... if not, there's no reason for this level of performance."

"Still, it's too severe."

After returning to our positions, the game resumed.

But Bologna's movements were disharmony itself.

I thought the discord was particularly severe among the defenders.

Their calls were consistently different.

Thanks to this, both Kenneth and I had it easy.

As long as I followed Joshua's passes, good opportunities kept coming up.

The only reason the score was just 1-0 until the 25th minute of the first half was solely because of Bologna's goalkeeper.

-Jakob Brune with a fantastic save!

-Once again, he saves Bologna from danger!

If it weren't for him, the first half would have ended 3-0.

But the Parma offense was too powerful for a lone goalkeeper to handle.

Suddenly, space opened up.

And Park Minho, who charged into that space, took a shot without hesitation, shaking Bologna's net.

-Gooooooal! The second goal in the 37th minute of the first half! Minho firmly secures the lead against Bologna!

-This is it! This is Parma! Parma, who regained their form in the match against Atalanta!

Waaah!

The away section was buzzing.

As I quietly shared the joy with the players and returned, Bologna's home fans were booing.

These boos weren't directed at us.

They were protesting against Bologna's poor performance.

Thanks to that, we could score another goal towards the end of the first half.

Facing a demotivated Bologna, there was no reason we couldn't score more than three goals.

The second half would be no different.

Just like in the first half, we'd probably enjoy hammering them and finish the game.

[Comments]

-Minhooooooo!

-This is it! This is it!

-Parma! Parma! Parma!

-With today's win, the gap with Inter who drew with Cremonese is back to 7 points! Hahaha!

-Stupid Inter guys! What? Three consecutive seasons at the top? Sorry, but we're winning this season!

-Great! It was a really wonderful match!

-Next opponent is Fiorentina, right?

Parma fans rejoiced in the victory.

With Inter drawing 1-1 against Cremonese, the point gap began to stretch back to 7 points.

After a long time, Parma enjoyed a clean sheet victory against Bologna, feeling the league performance returning.

Fans regained confidence, thinking that a Serie A championship might be possible.

In such a situation, the opponent for the second knockout round to advance to the Europa League quarter-finals was decided.

-Parma's opponent is… Athletic Bilbao!

The opponent for the second knockout round in the Europa League was Athletic Bilbao, a club with a strict pure-blood policy from Spain's Primera Liga.

The fans' reaction wasn't good.

This was because Athletic Bilbao's performance this season had been excellent.

-Bilbao… they're 4th in La Liga this season, right?

-We'll face them sooner or later… but this soon?

-We should be thankful we didn't meet Leipzig or Ajax… but they're still a tough opponent.

Naturally, the fans' reactions were filled with concern.

Moreover, the schedule leading up to the match against Athletic Bilbao wasn't favorable.

Despite having Verona, who were in the relegation zone, in between, tough matches against Fiorentina and Inter awaited.

Naturally, we had to focus on rotation, and Alain Levagne was well aware of this.

So on February 19th, in the match against Fiorentina, Coach Alain Levagne boldly rested some key players and fully rotated the squad, and received the results of that choice.

[Parma wins despite rotation? A 4-1 victory against Fiorentina!]

[Managing key players' stamina before the match against Inter, Parma!]

[Finally, the awaited 'that' match is approaching!]

[A six-point match! The winning team takes a step closer to the championship!]

[The 24th round match of Serie A 'Parma vs Inter' at Parma's home on February 22nd.]

The result was perfect.

Managing the stamina of the main players while also securing a victory.

Regularly rotating and managing the performance of the non-main players paid off.

Whether Parma would become the protagonist of a fairy tale.

Or a cruel fairy tale with a tragic ending.

A critical crossroads to determine the outcome awaited.

The match against Inter, ranked second in the league, awaited Parma.
