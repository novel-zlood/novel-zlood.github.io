## 47. Smooth Sailing (2)

After the big win against Beşiktaş, the 30th round of the league against Manchester City ended in a 2-2 draw.

Thanks to that, Liverpool started chasing fiercely again, narrowing the gap to 10 points, causing some Gunners to panic, exclaiming, "Are we going to be overtaken?"

Now, 8 league matches remain.

Honestly, within the squad, the atmosphere was that an undefeated league win was almost certain.

"It’s been almost 20 years since we got this close to winning the league... It's understandable for them to panic that much."

"Is that so?"

"This kind of performance is unfamiliar. They can’t get used to it. So, even with a 10-point lead, they feel uneasy."

There’s a peculiar persuasiveness in Lorenzo's words.

Indeed, it's understandable to feel uneasy.

Arsenal hasn’t won the league since the 03-04 season.

It's been 20 years without a league title.

I can understand the neurosis of the Gunners to some extent.

Monica sometimes even has nightmares, shouting, "Ah... No! Not 4rsenal!" and shivering.

Sometimes, seeing her like that makes me philosophically ponder, "What exactly is football to these people?"

When I asked Monica, she said it's similar to telling a Korean guy, "You’re bad at gaming," which would piss him off.

"Um... no, it's not."

As I was pondering Monica's fallacy, Lorenzo asked with a curious expression.

"What's not?"

"That you're a noob at FIFA."

"......"

What? If you’ve got a problem, come at me?

I couldn't help but react to Lorenzo's insolent gaze.

Wouldn’t my performance on the field tell you about my football gaming skills?

"Hey! Let’s have a proper match!"

"How much are we betting?"

"100 pounds."

I nodded lightly at Lorenzo's bet.

Honestly, I didn't think I would lose.

Why am I so confident?

Because I saw Lorenzo get thrashed by Jake in a football game at Bruno's house last time.

No matter how bad I am at games compared to the average Korean, I was confident I could beat Lorenzo.

Anyway.

The reason for all this small talk at the training ground is because our schedule has been very smooth.

As long as we don't suffer a huge defeat in the second leg of the Europa League Round of 16, we are set to advance to the quarterfinals. The FA Cup quarterfinal is also against Leicester City, who we faced in the League Cup final.

And as soon as the slightly tight schedule at the end of March is over, I’m flying to Korea.

Yes, the international match schedule is waiting for me.

* * *

[Arsenal advances to Europa League quarterfinals!]

[Arsenal loses 1-0 in the second leg of the Europa League Round of 16! But advances with a dominant first leg score!]

[Arsenal debuts 2 youth players, managing the rotations’ stamina!]

In the home match against Beşiktaş, we had the luxury of giving two youth players their professional debut.

Naturally, Beşiktaş players were fired up seeing our starting lineup, but the match ended 1-0, ending their Europa League journey in the Round of 16.

After a good rest at home, I prepared for the FA Cup quarterfinal.

The opponent was Leicester City, who we faced in the League Cup final.

Honestly, I was confident we would win again this time.

-Minho’s clean pass!

-Lorenzo! Gooooooal! The score now widens to 5-1!

-Leicester City concedes 3 goals in a row after the 40th minute of the second half, collapsing completely!

-Coach Rodgers is clutching his head.

After recording 2 assists and ensuring the team’s victory, I was the first to be subbed out and headed to the bench.

Lorenzo, who scored 2 goals today, sat next to me.

"I feel uneasy."

"Why?"

"It feels like it's going too smoothly."

"Really? I don’t feel that way."

Lorenzo couldn’t hide his unease.

It seemed like he recalled last season as he suddenly shivered and muttered.

"We went from 3rd place in the league to falling to 7th in a disastrous April... barely securing 5th place. It wasn’t a pleasant memory."

"......"

"This season won’t be like that, right?"

I don’t know what happened last season that made Lorenzo, who was so confident, turn timid.

As I spent time giving him some vague reassurance, the referee's whistle signaled the end of the match.

It wasn’t just Lorenzo; a few other veterans didn’t look very happy despite the big win, probably due to bad memories of April.

Despite the smooth atmosphere, something felt suffocating, so I planned to change the mood after the international matches.

As I was about to leave for Korea, Monica unusually worried and told me to be careful.

She said something ominous about April.

That Arsenal doesn’t get along well with the number ‘4’.

She told me to be careful not to get injured.

Curious, I checked Arsenal’s April performance from last season... It was a series of defeats.

Moreover, there were sudden injury reports.

I could understand why the players and Gunners were so terrified of April.

But wouldn’t this season be different?

That’s what I think.

First, let’s finish the World Cup Asia 1st Qualifier and then think about the league.

Yeah, what big deal could happen?

But.

Eventually, something did happen.

“Wow! An incredible fact about Arsenal!”

As soon as I returned to the team after the international match, 4 players were sidelined due to injuries.

Fortunately, they weren’t severe injuries, but it was affecting the team’s atmosphere more than expected.

When I got home, Monica welcomed me back from the international match and sighed in relief.

[Arsenal loses Maximiliano, Tyrone Tierney, Armani Richards, and Bukayo Saka to injuries!]

[Arsenal to face West Ham United in the league and Europa League quarterfinals!]

[Can Arsenal overcome the loss of 2 key defenders and 2 attackers to win against West Ham in two consecutive matches?]

[Arsenal's nightmare begins! The injury ward in April! Is April a bad month for Arsenal?]

The media also fueled the Gunners' anxiety by reporting on Arsenal’s sudden increase in injuries.

Seeing the players’ gloomy faces during training, I thought I had to work hard to change the atmosphere in the match against West Ham.

Time passed, and it was April 6th, the 31st round of the league.

West Ham players came to the Emirates Stadium.

The desperate chants of the Gunners could be felt from the locker room.

Honestly, I don’t care much about such negative jinxes, but other players did.

They might worry about suddenly collapsing and losing the undefeated title like last season.

The coach knew this and comforted the players well, and before stepping onto the field, Ødegaard boosted the morale of the younger players in the tunnel.

Alright, we need to win.

Let's win today and change the mood a bit.

Isn’t this too depressing?

* * *

While Arsenal's squad was feeling uneasy,

West Ham United's coach, David Butler, was also staring at the field with a worried expression.

“How do we stop that monster?”

Recently, although a few key players of Arsenal were out due to injuries, making the atmosphere not that great, as long as that monster was there, victory wasn’t guaranteed.

“As long as we can somehow block that overwhelming attack power... we can stop Arsenal’s unbeaten run.”

He wanted to leave a mark of ‘1’ in the loss column of Arsenal’s record, which was as spotless as snow.

Honestly, if it weren’t for that monster, he thought West Ham and Arsenal’s squad quality was similar.

Of the astounding 115 goals Arsenal had scored in the league, Park Minho alone accounted for 39 goals.

Including assists, his offensive points reached 58, meaning he was responsible for half of Arsenal's goals.

Without Park Minho, Arsenal’s current performance would surely be on par with West Ham.

Of course, Arsenal’s defense was quite decent, so they would still perform better than West Ham.

As soon as the game started, Arsenal attacked West Ham’s defense.

Arsenal’s players tried their best to connect quality passes to Park Minho.

West Ham pressured Arsenal’s players strongly, making it hard for Park Minho to receive the ball and advance.

“Good... good.”

David Butler nodded with satisfaction, watching Park Minho.

As expected, Park Minho frequently dropped to a lower position to receive the ball.

West Ham’s players moved according to his tactics to prevent direct connections to Park Minho.

Despite the tailored tactics, Park Minho eventually received the ball and began to shake West Ham’s right flank.

-Minho! Grabs the ball and runs!

-Minho swiftly bypasses Vladimir Kane!

A cross from the flank.

Lorenzo Lupo, moving centrally, delivered a fierce header, startling West Ham’s defense.

Direct shots were terrifying, but when Park Minho focused on connecting plays, he was a formidable attacker.

“If we can just stop Minho...”

West Ham had a good chance of winning.

It was obvious.

Arsenal’s attack revolved around Park Minho, and in games where Park Minho wasn’t in form, they displayed frustrating play.

But there was no solution.

Just as Barcelona couldn’t find a replacement for Messi, Arsenal had no substitute for Park Minho.

There could never be a replacement for players deemed ‘godly’.

David Butler quietly stood up.

West Ham’s attack was surprisingly smooth.

Especially Arsenal’s left side, without Tyrone Tierney, was shaky under Marcus Edwards’ breakthroughs.

“Good... keep it up.”

The atmosphere was good.

While Arsenal was unsettled by sudden injuries, West Ham was on a winning streak.

The only reason Arsenal hadn’t conceded from the left side was that Park Minho abandoned the attack to come deep and help with defense.

But that, too, had its limits.

David Butler waited patiently.

He believed West Ham would get an opportunity and watched quietly.

And then.

As if to reward his faith, Marcus Edwards, having bypassed Casper Nilsson, earned a free kick in a good position.

“Great!”

An opportunity from a good position.

West Ham wasn’t a foolish team to waste such a chance.

Sander Langland’s fast, low free kick was headed in by Niki Batshuayi to score the opening goal.

-Gooooooal!

-West Ham scores the opening goal just 8 minutes into the first half! Sander Langland’s free kick is finished by Niki Batshuayi’s header!

-Niki Batshuayi scores his 10th league goal! West Ham seizes the momentum early in the first half!

The Emirates Stadium murmured.

Gunners, with bad memories in April, looked even more distressed.

But the only player who could brighten their faces was Park Minho.

-Minho’s sharp pass! Jules Kaembe breaks into the center and shoots!

-Gooooooal! Arsenal equalizes just 2 minutes after conceding!

-Minho overcomes the pressure from 3 players!

-Remarkable!

After holding onto the ball amidst 3 defenders, he passed it to the open Jules Kaembe, who finished the play.

The Emirates Stadium erupted in cheers again.

David Butler ruffled his hair harshly and muttered.

“Fxxk! He plays football like a fxxking god!”
