## 23. The Villain Appears (1)

"Parma! Parma! Parma!"

"Hahaha! You stupid Zvezda guys! What? Red Star? You guys only deserve to be called Pink Star!"

"Even after playing so rough, you ended up conceding 2 goals to Minho? Hahaha!"

After the match, Parma's away fans who had come all the way to Belgrade were jeering.

They were also displeased.

There were constant dangerous situations where their proud player could have gotten injured.

Some were shouting loudly to be careful when Red Star comes to their home.

-The match ends!

-Parma wins 3-0 and takes 3 points in the Europa League group stage!

-Min Ho Park! You were amazing today! Scoring two goals from free kicks and assisting for Kenese's goal, showing an almost perfect performance!

It was an overwhelming victory.

After the match, Parma's players carefully boarded the bus rented by the club and returned to the hotel.

The flares rising in the distance seemed to represent the feelings of the home fans.

[Parma's Dominant 3-0 Victory!]

[LASK Linz, who has to face Parma in a week, is troubled! Who on earth should they stop?]

[Red Star sunk at home! Not only was their performance terrible, but their manners were lacking too?]

[Jaron Milikovic sent off! Racism against Parma's Minho!]

[Coach Dejan Stankovic, 'It was the worst behavior. I am deeply disappointed in Jaron's actions.']

[Internal disciplinary action taken by Zvezda club.]

As soon as they returned to Parma, the players started preparing for the match against LASK Linz next Thursday.

Thanks to the ample time, Parma was able to make considerable preparations and showed an overwhelming performance against Linz.

[Shocking Defeat! The match ends with a score of 9-0!]

[Parma makes history at home! Surpassing their 8-0 victory against Vicenza!]

In this match, Min Ho Park recorded 2 goals and 4 assists, being evaluated as having dominated the game.

Thanks to this, those who said he needed to prove himself in big matches were all silenced.

However.

When Min Ho Park recorded only 1 assist in the continued match against Benevento on September 25th, talks started again.

[Min Ho Park scoreless in 3 league matches!]

[Minho! Silence in the league! What is the reason?]

Although he was consistently accumulating attack points.

It seemed that others wanted more from Min Ho Park.

* * *

Indeed, people are unpredictable.

As soon as I didn't score in 3 consecutive league matches, some people came out with articles trying to criticize me.

[Is Min Ho Park's poor performance in the league due to the difference in level with Serie B?]

This person seemed to have no consideration for the fact that I recorded 4 assists in those 3 league matches.

Of course, such reactions are only from a few.

Most are growing more expectations as they see me consistently accumulating attack points.

Among the numerous articles, such an article is just one, so I ignored it.

Honestly, focusing more on the game rather than wasting mental energy on such things would be more helpful.

There are many players in the world with more records than me, and I started later than them, so I must focus on every match to catch up.

[Zinedine Zidane, 'He performed well in the Europa League too. Inter should be more aggressive in signing Minho.']

He is a great person.

I don't know if it's because he is still very active in trying to sign me, but I feel a considerable internal closeness.

But I had no intention of going to Inter.

Transferring to a team in the same league is not respectful to Parma, and it would greatly hurt the Parma fans who treat me like a god.

Anyway.

As I continued to perform well in the Europa League, several clubs seriously started to approach me.

Leo was delighted, saying that this time many clubs were genuinely asking what I wanted.

Moreover, as rumors about my transfer circulated, the communities related to overseas football in Korea were buzzing.

-So, where do you think Minho will transfer to?

-Of course, it's Inter.

-Hahaha! Min Ho Park will definitely transfer to the best club in Europe! Just keep that in mind.

-Hahaha, these clueless guys.

-Real Madrid, Man City, PSG, all are good! Please go to a wealthy club and win something!

-Seeing Shin Junseo suffering forever at Tottenham, it's clear that players should go to teams where they can win, hahaha

-Arsenal is good too...

-Such a pathetic house... I'll pity them.

-How did they finish 5th last season? This season they are really pathetic, hahaha

Rumors were widespread that I would transfer this winter.

Of course, I had no intention of leaving yet.

If I'm the god of Parma, I should at least complete a full season in Serie A before leaving.

[Min Ho Park, 'I have no intention of leaving the team this season. I will strive to bring glory to Parma before I leave.']

-Wow... that's impressive!

-Even if I didn't have national pride, I would feel it now, hahaha

-When I visited Parma recently, my Parma friends asked if I was Korean. When I nodded, they treated me to a full Parma course... it was awesome.

-Now there's not only a Busan full course but also a Parma full course;

-What Parma full course? If you didn't even visit Parma, hahaha. Just be proud that you weren't racially discriminated against; that's top 10% treatment, hahaha

No, it's true.

Recently, it was reported in local news that crimes against Koreans visiting Parma have significantly decreased.

They said it decreased by 30%.

Moreover, there is a Parma full course.

It's true.

Anyway.

I have no intention of leaving Parma.

There are still many things to do at Parma.

And I need to lift one more trophy.

* * *

It's an overwhelming performance.

Looking at Parma's recent performance, many people said it reminds them of the past Leicester City.

-Goooaaaal!

-Minhooo! A fantastic pass!

-Showing a fantastic performance in the Europa League! Minho recording 1 goal and 3 assists in today's match!

-Servette is being heavily defeated at Parma's home! And young striker Filippo Asnelli even records his debut hat trick, leading Parma to a big victory!

Europa League group stage match 3.

The opponent was Servette FC from the Swiss Super League.

We secured the victory as prepared.

The opponent was greatly shaken and collapsed.

Seeing me record 5 goals and 7 assists in 3 Europa League matches, many experts started to evaluate my value even higher.

The more they did, the more Parma was criticized.

[‘The Man of the Europa League!’ Min Ho Park records 12 attack points in 3 matches!]

[Even the buyout clause of 52 million euros is too low for Minho!]

-[Damn club! Minho's buyout clause is only 52 million euros? After being humiliated last season, they set such a ridiculous price?]

-[Even Leipzig's Carlos, who didn't score as much as Minho, has a buyout clause of 80 million euros! Damn idiots!]

-[No wonder they went bankrupt! Stupid owner! Stupid board! Stupid management team!]

-[Why the management team? They aren't bad.]

-[Minho's jersey is sold out again!]

-[Those are the damn bad guys!]

My jersey is sold out again?

Parma isn't that popular of a club.

They said only my jersey sold a lot.

Especially, there is quite a demand in China, they said.

Honestly, I don't know.

I thought fake ones would be more prevalent there.

But it seems they do buy the genuine ones.

Anyway.

Parma's performance was continuously improving.

Thanks to Coach Alain Levagne's meticulous rotation, the players didn't seem to be too fatigued.

Except for drawing with Torino, we showed overwhelming performances by winning all matches.

Some Serie A fans even wondered, 'Will they again this season like last season?'

That's how crazy our performance was.

But two consecutive unbeaten seasons would be too much.

The hellish schedule starts in October after finishing the last match of September against Servette FC.

"Roma, Sampdoria, Juventus, Milan..."

Except for Sampdoria, which had fallen to the relegation zone, we were facing tough teams.

Moreover, we had a Swiss away match in between.

Although we were playing at home, we were also waiting for a tough match against the rough Serbian friends.

Finally, the match against Napoli on November 2nd.

The tough schedule continued till the end of the first half.

That's probably why our coach paid a lot of attention to the rotation.

After the match on November 2nd, the 2022 Qatar World Cup awaited us.

It was indeed an incredibly tight schedule.

Thanks to this, there were a lot of Parma and Korean fans worried about my stamina or injuries.

But what can I do?

I'm a professional getting paid to play.

I have to play like crazy.

Alright! The Europa League is now halfway over.

It's time to focus on the league again.

Our next league opponent is AS Roma, coached by Matic.

It's not an easy opponent.

Although they suffered humiliation by losing to us last season, Coach Matic managed to win the Europa Conference League and somewhat restored his honor.

[Coach Matic, 'Minho is a good player. I would like to coach him directly someday.']

This guy is like Coach Zinedine Zidane.

Whenever my story comes up, he starts by saying he wants to sign me and follows with all sorts of praises.

It's not unpleasant but gives a strange feeling.

I mean, is this the same coach who was nicknamed 'Chameleon'?

It's almost clingy.

Even our Monica isn't like this.

-Monica: Ah! Where is the player who fits Arsenal's No. 9?

-Monica: Where is the world's coolest, sexiest, and most lovable striker?

No, I take that back.

There's still a long way to catch up with Monica.

Anyway.

The team's atmosphere is good these days.

Of course, it is.

The team keeps winning.

The reason Parma could show such a breakthrough in Serie A is naturally thanks to the young players' potential being realized.

Especially Kenese's form was remarkable.

He was scoring as much as me in the league and was also accumulating assists by heading down balls.

Thanks to him, I could often see young players actively training around Kenese these days.

It felt like he became the leader of the young players.

“To play like Minho…”

Precisely, it seemed more fitting to describe him as a cult leader.

What else could it be if he keeps bringing up 'Minho' whenever he talks to the young players?

The problem was that the young players looked at me like some sort of god because they listened to Kenese’s words.

Sometimes, they even chanted my name in the shower room.

“Do you believe?”

“Minhoooo!”

“Do you believe?”

“Minhoooo!”

That was quite creepy.

Looking at it, sometimes it is scary.

* * *

It's a rare day off.

Our coach benched me for the AS Roma match.

It's probably because of the packed schedule in October due to the 2022 Qatar World Cup.

There are matches almost every 3-4 days.

So our coach boldly gave up on some matches.

The problem is that the results aren't great.

The boos from the traveling fans who followed us to the away match could be heard.

Booo!

“Where is Minho?”

“Alain! You bastard! We're losing 2-1! Why isn't Minho coming out!”

“Minhooooooo!”

“Is this football? Is this football?”

Today's starters were close to a 1.5 team.

Roma also formed their team similarly, but it seemed like an inevitable choice due to the series of injuries early in the season, causing a severe lack of depth.

AS Roma was fiercely persistent.

No wonder, having piled up quite a few losses early in the season, they had dropped to 12th place in the league, so they probably had no choice but to be urgent.

Despite leading 2-1, Coach Matic's face was completely stiff.

Well, our coach was the same.

He might have felt a bit frustrated seeing the performance falter after resting some main players for a bit.

He scratched his head and called me.

“Minho!”

“Shall I get ready?”

“Yes, please.”

The score was a precarious 2-1.

AS Roma also started preparing their substitutes quickly seeing me warming up.

The expressions on the defense, who collapsed twice from counterattacks, were terrible.

I need to go in quickly and boost their spirits.

The game didn’t seem to stop sooner than expected.

Whistle!

Ah! Finally, the ball went out.

It felt like I waited for about 5 minutes.

As I was getting ready to step onto the field, Coach Matic looked at me with an expectant expression.

No, you shouldn’t make that face.

“Parc Minho!”

“Parc Minho!”

“Minhooooo! We believe in you!”

“Ahhhh! Minho! Please save Parma!”

I could feel the immense enthusiasm from the fans waiting for me.

Kenese, who scored 1 goal today, came off and we high-fived.

-Minho is substituted in at the 21st minute of the second half!

-Ah! The voices of Parma's away fans have gotten louder as soon as this player steps onto the field.

-It’s understandable! It means Minho's status in Parma is that significant.

Seeing me being substituted, Roma's defense tensed up significantly.

“Please stop him!”

“Why is that guy coming out?”

“Please! Let’s end it like this! Please!”

As soon as I got the ball, Roma's home fans, with anxious expressions, started fervently cheering for Roma.

Some fans even pointed fingers at me.

It felt weird.

It was like I became the villain.
