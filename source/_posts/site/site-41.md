## 16. Value Surge (5)

Despite being down 1-0, Coach Gasperini calmly watched the field.

Parma Calcio.

Indeed, they are a competitive team in Serie A.

It was clear that they would stir up Serie A next season.

However...

When asked if they were a team to be wary of, he could confidently shake his head.

The team itself wasn't frightening.

"Crack."

Yes, that crack was the scary part.

The other players were also at a level that could be threatening in Serie A.

But the player called 'Minho' was beyond a threat; he had the skill to single-handedly defeat a Serie A team.

"Move more precisely!"

After encouraging the players in the technical zone, Coach Gasperini turned his head.

At the end of his gaze was Park Minho.

Watching the relentless way he exploited Atalanta’s defensive weaknesses, Gasperini couldn't help but stick out his tongue.

Was that kind of play, targeting the opponent’s weak spots, based on instinct?

Or was it created through effort?

He was curious.

What kind of player is he?

"Was the buyout clause around 20 million euros?"

That's chump change.

The market is closed this winter.

There might be an opportunity to sign him this summer.

But it felt like he wouldn't be able to buy him for just 20 million euros.

Parma wouldn't be foolish enough not to raise that buyout clause with a new contract.

His value would surely skyrocket.

But oddly enough, even with a steep price hike, acquiring that player wouldn't feel like a waste of money.

Just then, the referee's whistle blew.

As he heard the sound signaling the end of the first half, Coach Gasperini looked at the field calmly before turning to head to the locker room.

The observations were up to halftime.

From the second half, it was time to start the counterattack.

Coach Gasperini quietly chuckled, feeling a rare sense of competitiveness at his age.

Indeed.

Football was fun.

It was so fascinating.

* * *

"Minho."

"Why?"

"I suddenly want to get an assist."

"Are you crazy?"

The flirtatious guy chuckled and shook his head.

"No, today is the day to get an assist."

"You seem a bit crazy."

"I think so too."

Realizing his true self now, congratulations, Santiago.

You're now Crazy Santiago.

"Focus! Focus!"

After finishing the conversation with Santiago, our coach entered the locker room with a smile and stood in front of the tactics board.

"So, how do you feel about the situation where the ball transitions rapidly and you're exhausted by the opponent’s strong pressing?"

"It's the worst."

At Gennaro's response, Coach Alain Levagne nodded.

"The opponent probably feels the same."

"Atalanta ran much more than usual in the first half, and they'll probably catch their breath a bit in the second half."

"We'll exploit that gap."

Our coach gestured at the tactics board.

I roughly understood what he meant.

When the opponent catches their breath at the beginning of the second half, let's rush in like madmen and score another goal.

It's half-crazy.

If we succeed and make it 2-0, the opponent will be desperate.

Our coach seemed to believe that the early part of the second half was the crucial moment of today’s match.

Even if we just defend like turtles after pouring out our energy in that instant, this away match would be a success.

The second leg will be at our home.

There's a saying, after all.

Even a stray dog gets half the win in front of its house.

We're not stray dogs, but how comfortable would it be to return home after scoring two goals away?

"At the start of the second half, press hard and crush Atalanta!"

"Even if we score two goals, they’re Atalanta, so they'll definitely chase quickly."

"It doesn't matter! The game we're betting on is the second leg! We'll drag that damn Atalanta into the mud of defeat at our home, Ennio Tardini!"

Like our coach said.

There's still a second leg, so it's worth taking a gamble.

But it seems like Atalanta has something in mind too.

Will this be enough?

I'm a bit worried.

Shortly after.

The players of both our team and Atalanta headed back to the field for the second half.

On the surface, there wasn't any significant change for the opponent either.

But as soon as the second half began, I realized one truth.

'Any idea you think of has already been thought of by someone in the world.'

As the second half began.

Just like us, running like mad dogs.

Atalanta also ran like mad dogs.

Neither team thought about catching their breath.

The match was decided at the beginning of the second half.

"Crazy bastards!"

At our flirt's shout, Atalanta's wing-back also shouted loudly.

"Sons of bitches!"

Seeing as both had the same thought.

This was clearly mutual loathing.

But even in such a physically demanding situation, it's impressive that they still have the energy to shout curses at the opponent.

In a way, it was quite remarkable.

- The choice of both teams is pressure! More pressure!

- My expectation that they would take a breather in the second half is completely shattered!

- This means that the most crucial factors in today's game are the players' stamina and mental strength!

The central dominance battle between the two teams was intense.

Even though I went down to help, our midfield was overwhelmed by the toughness of Atalanta's midfield.

In times like these, I miss Franco's physicality.

Despite pouring out our stamina, we had to catch our breath first as we lost the central dominance.

- Atalanta has taken control! With Parma catching their breath, they continue to allow central breakthroughs.

- And at this moment, the ball is connected to Teun Koopmeiners!

- Teun makes a long pass forward!

Receiving Teun’s pass, Duván Zapata took a non-stop shot, threatening our goalpost.

But Giovanni threw his body and caught the ball.

Indeed, a world-class goalkeeper was different.

But it was dangerous.

If we keep allowing shots like this after losing dominance.

No matter how strong our defense is, it would eventually be penetrated.

We needed a turnaround.

However, like in the first half, I also needed a breather to exert my influence.

Yes, this was a period we had to endure.

I just had to endure another 10 minutes.

Then Atalanta would also catch their breath.

Ooooh!

Another shot from Atalanta.

The ratio of on-target shots seemed to be increasing.

This was never a good sign.

The words of Mr. Park, the self-proclaimed 'God of Early Morning Football' from SingSing Corporation, naturally came to mind.

'In early morning football, the more shots on goal, the higher the chance of the goalkeeper making a mistake.'

This is the pros.

That statement doesn't apply entirely here.

But one thing was certain: allowing continuous on-target shots was not good news.

And.

Just as Mr. Park, the God of Early Morning Football said.

Giovanni Buffon, our invincible shield, couldn’t block the shot from Atalanta's wing-back, Davide Zappacosta.

It wasn't a mistake.

It just meant the opponent shot that well.

- Gooooooal!

- Atalanta! They score to bring the game back to a tie! With Davide quickly moving up and taking a shot!

- Truly bold!

- The movement to create space by switching with Duván Zapata was really good.

- Parma's defense must have been surprised. Why is there a wing-back in the striker's position all of a sudden? That kind of feeling!

- Yes, Parma momentarily lost focus!

The score is back to 1-1.

It’s a satisfactory score for an away game.

But it seemed the Parma players, including me, were not happy about letting a winnable game slip away.

Now, Atalanta has used up their turn.

Their stamina was depleted.

As they began catching their breath, they would start to give the game’s flow back to us.

But it didn’t seem easy.

Even while catching their breath, they continued to press hard against anyone who crossed the halfway line.

It was a bit difficult to connect passes.

I was fine.

But Franco, having aged, was not free from such pressing.

Now, it’s up to me.

Honestly, this mindset isn’t good.

But my teammates weren’t in great shape.

Only Kenaz and I seemed to be in good condition.

Santiago also slowed down a bit due to fatigue.

Gennaro was completely exhausted.

Our coach was preparing substitutions.

But on the bench, there were more players adept at defense than offense.

So.

I had to do it.

Our coach was looking at me desperately.

It meant he wanted me to do it.

'Minho, do it.'

So, I had to do it.

You could call it greedy.

But having a player like this is good, right?

"Pass!"

At my pass request, Franco hurriedly sent the ball over.

Teun Koopmeiners, who had been desperately running to stop me all game, quickly closed in.

In the first half, Teun could barely keep up with my speed.

But the second half was different.

- Minho! He catches the ball and runs!

- He beats Teun Koopmeiners with speed!

You’re exhausted, right?

You’re not fast, and with your stamina depleted.

There’s no way to catch up to me.

As I quickly dribbled forward, another player came to block me.

At the same time, I saw Kenaz making the promised move into Atalanta’s open space.

Tap!

Kenaz received the ball clumsily and started running.

Honestly, I wanted to pass more kindly.

But my stamina was also low, so the pass wasn’t precise.

Still, our Kenaz has improved a lot.

At least his ball control has significantly improved.

He could have missed it, but.

He forced it under control and ran.

- Kenaz runs down the flank!

- In the center are Minho and Santiago!

- Gennaro is following slightly behind!

But did Kenaz know how to cross?

As I was thinking that.

Our giant Kenaz finally made his first pro cross.

"Wow."

That’s not a cross; it’s like a ballistic missile.

It flew quickly to the opposite wing.

I wonder if I can catch it.

- Minho rushes to catch it!

- It was a very sloppy cross!

- Minho! He catches the ball! But there’s Davide Zappacosta on his back!

I could feel the heavy presence on my back.

It must be Atalanta’s right wing-back, Davide.

Tap! Tap-tap!

I flicked the ball up with my toes.

Then I swung my knee, kicking the ball while keeping my foot flexed.

The ball flew over both Davide and me.

Simultaneously, I turned left, escaping Davide’s pressure.

- Minho! He flicks the ball over Davide’s head!

- A fantastic sombrero flick! Minho! Minho! Minho!

Davide, who got beaten by the flick, quickly closed in on me.

There was a defender in front.

And Davide behind.

Here, fancy skills weren't needed.

With a simple body feint and a move with the ball, I shifted it to the left.

Yes, the La Croqueta.

With my sudden movement, the defender fell as if hit by a tranquilizer dart.

I didn't miss the opportunity.

I went deeper and took a shot with my right foot at a tight angle.

The ball pierced strongly into the top right corner of the goal, bypassing the goalkeeper.

Boom!

Splash!

Honestly, I didn’t expect it.

But seeing the goal go in cleanly, I quickly ran toward the broadcast camera.

Reaching the camera, I grabbed it and shouted in Korean.

"The Han River water is warm!"

"Make sure to jump in with only your underwear on!"

I hope they understood that?

Well, it doesn’t matter if they didn’t.

Why is Korea called the Internet powerhouse?

Because we have the ability to spread such issues faster than anyone.

What?

You disagree?

If not, then never mind.

* * *

Beep! Beeeeep! Beeeep!

- The match ends!

- The first leg between Parma and Atalanta ends with Parma’s 2-1 victory!

- Minho’s fantastic goal in the 17th minute of the second half seems to be the decisive goal of today’s match.

Up until the 20th minute of the second half, the game was intense.

After Park Minho scored, both teams’ players quickly depleted their stamina, slowing the game’s tempo.

Both coaches used all their substitution cards to reinvigorate their teams.

But the fast and intense transitions and pressing shown earlier didn’t reappear.

Thanks to that, a sluggish match continued, ultimately ending 2-1 in favor of Parma in the first leg of the Coppa Italia semi-final.

It was a disappointing result for Atalanta.

[A match that wasn’t high-scoring but intense! The winner is Parma with Minho!]

[Minho, who scored a decisive goal with a fantastic sombrero flick and La Croqueta! You can hear the sound of his value rising!]

[Coach Gasperini, ‘I could understand why many coaches want Minho. I think he’s a crack who can change a game on his own.’]

[Minho, shouting something in Korean into the camera after his goal! What did he say?]

[Han River water? Warm? What does it mean? What did Park Minho shout into the camera?]

[Skyrocketing value! Growing attention on Minho!]

[Crying over the low buyout despite the rising value, Parma Calcio!]

[Comments]

- Hahahahaha, you can hear the lament of the mackerel plate lunch shop owner with those extraordinary thighs, hahaha.

- There’s a stupid Mituber who promised to jump into the Han River in just his underwear if Park Minho doesn’t score against Atalanta? Bboosh-boosh-boosh!

- Hahaha, Mituber Korean Messi is screwed, right?

- No, hahaha, there’s already Lee Seongwoo, who’s called Korean Messi, so how can an ordinary person, not from Barça Youth, be Korean Messi?

- Jump in! Jump in! Jump in! Jump in! Jump in! Jump in!

- Hey! Baek! Jump in already!

At the same time, Park Minho’s fantastic goal and his shout into the broadcast camera became a hot topic.

And the man with extraordinary thighs confirmed to jump into the Han River in just his underwear.

Baek Seunghoon stared blankly at the screen.

"What on earth…!"

He swallowed his saliva with a cold sweat trickling down.

Park Minho, whom he was jealous of, was skyrocketing in value, causing a commotion, while he was in trouble for a different reason.

Baek Seunghoon hurriedly entered his Mitube channel.

He saw numerous comments on his latest video.

Reading the comments with a pale face, he realized.

"I'm screwed."

I’m really screwed!
