## 16. Value Surge (4)

At the end of February, when the weather started to warm up a bit.

The match against Atalanta BC was quickly approaching.

The group chat, which had been focused on the Serie A league, was abuzz with the result of one match.

-MilanoLove: Honestly, isn't the real Nerazzurri Atalanta, not Inter?

-RealMilan: Eat shit.

-Roberto: Honestly, it's Inter<Atalanta, that's the norm.

-RealMilan: You wanna die?

-KingWangJjangJuve: LOL, the fake Nerazzurri who got thrashed 3-1 by Atalanta, cut! cut! cut!

-RealMilan: ...

Just from the chat, you could tell who won.

Probably Inter lost.

More importantly, Atalanta's recent performance has been unusual.

Why does their performance suddenly explode right before they face us?

It's so unfair.

-Park Minho: It's unfair! Of all times, Atalanta's performance improves right before they face us.

-RealMilan: Dude? Did we complain like that when we faced you?

-MilanoLove: LOL

-Roberto: Honestly, I never dreamed Minho would thrash Inter like that.

I didn't know either.

I felt really light that day.

These days, it's really frustrating.

-KingWangJjangJuve: Ugh! X-baptus revived like a beast!

-RealMilan: When did Juve climb back up to 4th place? Honestly, it's a bit scary.

Come to think of it.

Juventus quickly climbed back to 4th place.

They are indeed a prestigious club.

-Monica: It's because they got the Arsenal curse.

-KingWangJjangJuve: ?

-Monica: For the next 10 years, they'll be stuck in 4th place and always get knocked out in the round of 16 in the Champions League.

-KingWangJjangJuve: Don't jinx it! Don't joke around. Where's such a curse? LOL

However.

Monica went silent.

In that brief moment of calm.

I also swallowed my saliva nervously.

Then Monica replied again.

-Monica: Does it look like a joke?

-KingWangJjangJuve: (╬⁽⁽ ⁰ ⁾⁾ Д ⁽⁽ ⁰ ⁾⁾) Don't joke around! I said stop joking! Stop it!

-Monica: LOL

-RealMilan: Ah LOL Stop it LOL

-MilanoLove: Right, you shouldn't have teased Arsenal about not even making it to the Europa League.

-Roberto: As long as it's not meeee!

Friends taking the chance to tease.

Our Sungkyung, a die-hard Juventus fan, steadfastly cheered for Juventus to reach the Champions League quarterfinals.

-KingWangJjangJuve: The Bianconeri won't succumb to such baseless slander.

-KingWangJjangJuve: We'll win the round of 16 this time to prove there's no Arsenal curse!

However.

The curse seemed to be real.

In the first leg of the Champions League round of 16.

Juventus lost 3-2 at home against Real Madrid.

They even conceded two penalties in the most ridiculous manner as if possessed by a ghost.

As a result, Sungkyung was practically begging after the match.

-KingWangJjangJuve: Monica! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

-KingWangJjangJuve: （ﾉ´д｀）Please save me! Please save me! Please save me! Please save me! Please save me!

Good luck.

Juventus.

Not sure if it'll go well.

Coppa Italia.

So, the Italian Cup semifinals are played twice, home and away.

This means that even if you don't score in the first leg, there's still a chance in the second leg.

Honestly, reading this made me strangely competitive, and I really wanted to win against Atalanta.

Moreover, I definitely wanted to score.

As a player for Parma, I had a strong desire to win this cup.

Since 2002, Parma hasn't lifted a single trophy in the Coppa Italia.

The players also showed more competitive spirit for this Atalanta match than recent league games.

Probably because the league title was almost secured, there was more focus on this cup.

Moreover, looking at the league schedule in March, there didn't seem to be many matches against strong teams.

Parma fans were also getting excited.

If we could beat Inter.

Why not Atalanta?

[Honestly, Inter is overrated. If we get promoted to Serie A, we could settle in at least 7th place?]

-Atalanta should be a piece of cake, right?

-That's not true. Last time, they thrashed Inter 3-1.

-We should be wary of Atalanta's attack.

-I agree with the above. Atalanta's signature attacking football is fierce.

-We should trust Minho.

-That's right! Minho scored 2 goals against Inter and led us to victory!

I was happy to see so many compliments about me.

I was a bit surprised that so many fans saw a high chance for Parma.

I could definitely feel that fans' expectations had risen significantly due to our recent performances.

-It's a battle of swords.

-Exactly! Parma has scored 106 goals in the league, exactly twice as many as Ternana, the team with the second-highest goals.

-It's all thanks to Minho.

-That's right! With 29 goals and 22 assists in the league, Minho has contributed to almost half of our team's goals!

I'm satisfied.

I thought I should strive to record more attacking points.

But.

The first leg of the semifinals is away.

I'm not sure what an away match against Atalanta will be like.

It will definitely be harder than at home, right?

I'm a bit worried.

* * *

March 1st.

The first leg of the Italian Cup semifinals.

“Our cheer song is on a different level, isn't it?”

“Atalanta's cheer song is highly rated as one of the best in Serie A.”

“Really?”

“Of course. It's made by a famous Italian band. If it doesn't stick, that's the problem.”

The young players were impressed by Atalanta's cheer song.

I thought so too.

Giovanni looked at it and said, “Parma's cheer song is good too...,” but.

Unfortunately, the young players seemed to find Parma's cheer song a bit childish.

Well, I also thought it was a bit childish when I first heard it... So, enough said.

Still, Parma's cheer song was really good at making the heart race.

Simple.

It had a punch to it.

Honestly, when a cheer song sticks, people don't care if it's childish or simple.

In that sense, Atalanta's cheer song lacked the roughness typical of a cheer song.

Before entering the field.

I looked at the Atalanta players.

They all seemed relaxed.

Indeed, we are still the underdogs.

But I don't understand why the coach over there swallowed his saliva when he saw me.

Is he a cannibal?

“Kenneth.”

“Yes, hyung.”

“No, don't overuse that. It looks weird. Feels like we're gangsters or something.”

“Gangsters?”

“Korean-style mafia.”

“Oh! Mafia!”

Kenneth has been calling me 'hyung' ever since I taught him the word.

The problem is, with Kenneth's build, we oddly look like gangsters.

Santiago also wants to call me hyung.

Hey, you're the same age as me.

What hyung?

Well...

When I see the childish side of the rascal, it feels like I'm the big brother, so it might be a fitting title.

Entering the field.

The players took their positions.

We were in our usual 3-4-3.

Atalanta was in a 3-4-1-2 formation.

A somewhat similar strategy.

But as the game started, we could feel that the detailed tactics of the two teams were a bit different.

First, in the attacking situation.

We followed predetermined setups, with either Franco or me leading the attack.

Naturally, we moved according to our setups.

Showing a lot of organized movements.

But Atalanta was different.

They constantly switched positions and moved freely, making their attacks very sharp.

Especially Josip Iličić and Luis Muriel, who often switched even with wingbacks or defenders.

These switches created confusion in our defense, and they utilized the spaces created to score many goals.

Even the central defender would come up high and deliver good passes.

Considering that the central defender, Rafael Toloi, has recorded 8 attacking points this season, it was a significant point that couldn't be ignored.

Both teams had the same advantage of gaining an attacking edge through strong pressing and high activity.

But when transitioning to attack.

Parma moved in an organized manner.

Atalanta often switched positions freely to confuse the opposing defense.

Of course, there were similar drawbacks.

Parma left only one defender behind.

Atalanta used strong man-to-man pressing from the front to gain an attacking edge.

Both teams often conceded goals easily when their pressing failed.

-Minho withstands Atalanta's pressing!

-Atalanta's backline is suddenly open!

-Santiago! He's running! Santiago! Santiago!

Thanks to this, the game was dynamic.

There was no usual probing.

In the first 5 minutes of the game, the two teams combined for 7 shots, showing how fast-paced the game was.

Because of this, we were the ones suffering.

The fans were probably enjoying the game.

-Santiago shoots!

-Ah! It goes over the goalpost!

-Both teams have taken 4 shots each so far! But no goals yet.

-It's only been a little over 6 minutes. Parma and Atalanta are both running more than usual.

Both teams were definitely running more than usual.

Atalanta seemed to feel the same.

Maybe today, the team with better stamina will win.

“Minho!”

The ball was connected to me again.

An Atalanta midfielder pressed me hard to block my advance, but I easily dodged him and carried the ball to the flank, sprinting forward.

This time, the ball landed on Kenneth's chest.

Kenneth barely controlled the ball and passed it to the onrushing Gennaro.

A perfect pass.

But as if cursed, our shot was blocked by the opposing goalkeeper again.

-Despite numerous shots, the attacking lines of both teams are underperforming today.

-Ever since Papu Gomez left for Sevilla, Atalanta's attack has sometimes been strangely blocked.

-Yes. With Josip Iličić, he used to orchestrate the team's attack, and since his departure, Atalanta's attack has been somewhat lackluster.

-Now it's Atalanta's counterattack.

It was the same for the opponent.

Despite moving a lot and creating many gaps in our defense.

Atalanta also kept missing good opportunities.

Naturally, the voices of the coaches on both benches were getting louder.

Ah, I want to change the flow...

Today, my role was to share the pressure on Franco.

So today, I was the bridge.

I often carried the ball forward and created opportunities.

But the goals weren't coming from the front.

If I dragged the ball forward out of greed, it would disrupt our promised movements.

Of course, the coach would think it's fine as long as I score.

But why do tactics exist?

There's a reason for them.

But I can't not score.

This time, if I get a chance, I'll take a long shot.

I'm good at shooting from a distance too.

But I feel a bit chilly.

Atalanta's coach.

So, Tony Romazo Gasperini, is looking at me with a strangely affectionate gaze.

The same eyes as Inter's Gino Inzaghi.

In the last game, I really showed some fantastic moves, so I understand.

But not today.

It's only been a little less than 10 minutes in the first half.

I haven't shown anything yet.

Despite that, he's looking at me with those eyes.

Ah, I tend to score better when I'm expected to.

Shouldn't I score one then?

Get the attention of various soccer coaches.

Raise my value a lot too.

Isn't that good?

-The ball passes to Minho again!

-Today, Minho is moving like a lubricant in Parma's attack.

-If Minho hadn't come down to relieve Franco's pressure, Parma would've been more overwhelmed by Atalanta's strong pressing.

Today, my position is 1.5.

With movements fitting for a 9.5 role, I'm distributing passes to Kenneth and Gennaro in the front.

Since I'm not taking shots, Tihoden de Roon is giving me some space in front.

But I held back.

To take a clean shot.

I passed it long to the flank again.

Tihoden de Roon looked at me curiously.

A player who usually dribbles well and takes many shots is quiet today.

It's strange.

Is he always like this?

At the same time, he might think.

Is Minho not in good form?

As he starts thinking that, if I make a few more passing mistakes.

He'll think.

Ah! This guy isn't in good form today!

Then he would gradually lose focus on me.

Tihoden would start to pay attention to other players.

But what can you do?

I'm planning to take a long shot now.

Then in the 17th minute of the first half.

The opportunity came.

“Minho!”

The ball connected to me.

Tihoden de Roon's reaction was a bit slow.

That meant it was the perfect space and timing for a long shot.

If I don't take this shot, I'm a fool.

I don't want to be called a fool.

Imagining the trajectory I wanted, I struck hard.

The ball curved slightly.

I couldn't help but smile as I watched the ball head for an unexpected course.

Only then did Tihoden flinch in surprise.

He realized his mistake.

But he had already paid the price.

Thump!

Sir.

This gentleman has paid your bill.

By the way, no refunds.

-Gooooooal! Minhooooo! A fantastic long shot!

-The ball deflected off defender Gerard Dinci's thigh into the net!

-The deflection made it impossible for goalkeeper Juan Colosso to react properly!

My powerful shot curved nicely and deflected off the defender's thigh.

I was a bit lucky too.

Even if it hadn't hit the defender, it would've gone in.

So it was a bit disappointing.

Whoosh!

Seeing the net shake, I quickly ran towards the away stand.

This time, it was a butt slide.

Seeing our Alain coach looking at me with a thrilled expression made me satisfied.

Atalanta's Gasperini coach was also comforting his players, saying it was an unavoidable goal.

That meant the timing and trajectory of my long shot were incredible.

Has my value risen a lot?

I wondered.

But this feels like it might be recognized as an own goal...

If so, the guy with the exceptional thigh running a mackerel rice restaurant won't acknowledge it.

So.

"One more goal!"

Yes, let's score one more.

Then I can comfortably enjoy the view.

Right?
