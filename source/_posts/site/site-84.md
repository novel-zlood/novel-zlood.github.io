## 30. Mini Treble! (3)

[Parma! The protagonist of a fairy tale!]

[Parma wins the Serie A title for the 22-23 season!]

[This season, what remains for Parma are the Coppa Italia and Europa League titles!]

[Mino leads the team to victory with a hat-trick! Impressing everyone as the 'God of Parma'!]

[Seven spectators fainted in the stands! Italy is shocked by Parma's sensational league victory!]

[Comments]

- Wowwwwwww!

- Parmaaaaaa! Parmaaaaaa!

- Minoooooooo! For the first time in club history, Parma has won the Serie A title!

- My grandfather cried tears of joy right after the Udinese game ended. So touching.

- We... won the league? I can't believe it.

- Alain Levagne and the players are insane! They're the best! Especially our superstar Mino, he's on another level!

- My uncle gave me 50 euros as pocket money! To celebrate Parma's victory!

- That uncle is a bit stingy. If it were me, I'd give my nephew 500 euros to celebrate Parma's victory!

- Oh! Thanks! 50 euros is indeed a bit stingy for a nephew, right? I should withdraw 500 euros and give it. Thanks.

As soon as the game against Udinese ended, the city of Parma turned into a frenzy.

To be honest, when we won the Coppa Italia last season and went undefeated in Serie B, Parma's fans were really quiet.

But the moment we clinched the first Serie A title in the club's history...

The city was literally paralyzed.

Honestly, last season wasn't paralyzing to this extent, but now it's so intense that it even scares me. The whole city is united with "We Are Parma!"

The Parma anthem plays 24/7.

And this isn't even the peak yet.

If we lift another trophy in the Coppa Italia final in three days... I'm afraid someone might actually die from joy.

Anyway.

Our next opponent is Torino.

Honestly, I never imagined Torino would make it to the Coppa Italia final.

They're not an easy team.

People might think:

- What? Torino is a mid-table team. How can they be tough? Does that make sense?

But.

If you look at the results of Parma vs. Torino in the league, you'd think differently.

This season.

Twice we faced Torino in the league, and both times the result was a draw.

Yes, Torino is the only team we didn't defeat this season.

Honestly, Torino is a tricky team.

Their scoring is poor, barely 10 goals more than the lowest-scoring team, Sampdoria.

They're not incredibly good at defending either.

They have top-tier defense, but they often lose by a large margin against top teams.

But.

Strangely, Torino shows resilience against Parma, rarely allowing goals.

I don't remember scoring against Torino.

For some reason, scoring against them isn't easy.

I don't know if it's a matter of compatibility, but getting 3 points against Torino feels harder than against Inter.

That said, they're not an extremely difficult team.

They defend well against us, but they can't score for their lives.

Anyway, I've also had poor results against Torino, so it's a tie.

I usually score at least one goal against other teams, but not against Torino.

I don't know why.

Even when I was in good form, scoring against them was tough.

Maybe Torino knew this, as they came out strong in pre-match interviews.

[Torino's coach, Silvio Maran: "Parma's Mino is just an ordinary striker to us."]

[Silvio Maran: "In the Coppa Italia final, Mino will do nothing. He'll be rolling around like a pig against our defense."]

Wow... Such confidence.

Well, I have to admit.

It's true that I didn't make any impact in the two previous games against Torino.

I didn't think much of it.

But others seemed to.

[Filippo Asnelli: "There's no need to bring Mino into this. Torino will be crushed like idiots by Parma."]

Filippo Asnelli, the gentle skinhead who loves hamsters, made a strong statement in front of reporters for the first time since his debut.

What?

Will the sun rise from the west tomorrow?

* * *

At the start of the season, Filippo Asnelli was just the 6th option as a striker.

But.

As he gradually produced results and overtook others, he became a regular starter, often named as a forward alongside Park Minho and Kenneth as the season progressed.

Yes, he overtook Gennaro Tatis, the firm starter from last season, and took his place.

And his stats so far were 35 games, 24 goals, and 11 assists this season.

He had perfectly adapted to Serie A.

Naturally, his agent was thrilled.

A player from the French third division had become a regular starter in Serie A.

Filippo was also delighted.

Not only was he a starter, but he also earned a lot of money through contract renewals.

Especially, he was most pleased that with his new income, he could provide better food for his hamster, hedgehog, and cat.

He was deeply grateful to Park Minho, who helped him the most in his life.

Without him, he wouldn't have adapted easily at Parma and would have crumbled.

Park Minho would scratch his head and say, "Did I?" but to Filippo, Park Minho was like a mentor who taught him many things during training.

Moreover, when many people saw him as a "weirdo" for being interested in cute animals despite his rough appearance, it was Park Minho who asked to see pictures of his hamster.

All Parma players saw Park Minho as an idol, but to Filippo Asnelli, Park Minho was more than an idol; he was a benefactor who changed his life.

That's why he was angry.

"What? Rolling around like a pig?"

He couldn't stand the mockery, comparing Mino to the nickname of super-agent Mino Raiola, who caused controversy by signing a contract with Torino's young prospect, Lorenzo Vilgio.

So, he got angry.

In front of reporters.

But his anger didn't stop.

His rough appearance.

As he walked around with a scowl, even those known to have strong nerves in Parma didn't easily approach him.

With tattoos covering his burn scars and a recent thick beard, Filippo Asnelli looked like an Italian gangster, making his surroundings empty quickly.

Of course, Santiago, Park Minho, and Kenneth, who often hung out with Filippo, didn't mind.

They just thought he was a bit angry because his teammate was mocked.

His expression grew more menacing as the game approached.

Finally, sensing something was off, coach Alain approached Filippo Asnelli cautiously.

"You're not feeling sick, are you?"

Honestly, even he was a bit scared of Filippo.

How could an Italian's face resemble a boxer like Tyson?

"Coach. I'm starting this game, right?"

Coach Alain Levagne quickly nodded.

He felt pressured, thinking his back might break if he nodded too late.

Of course, Filippo wouldn't do that.

But looking at his fierce expression... he couldn't ignore the possibility of something drastic happening.

Thus, match day arrived.

The Coppa Italia final held at Rome's Stadio Olimpico.

* * *

I want to say this.

I wasn't particularly bothered or offended by Torino's provocation.

I know better than anyone that trash talk and rough play are part of the game.

"Mino... I'm sorry. Our coach might have been a bit harsh in the interview."

But why was Torino's defender Gleyson Rovingho rolling on the field, unable to regain his senses, and why was his fellow defender Claudio Buongiorno apologizing to me?

The reason was that player over there.

- Filippo Asnelli! The opening goal!

- Parma takes the lead in the 21st minute of the first half! Filippo Asnelli scores an incredible goal!

In the 21st minute of the first half, Filippo Asnelli scored.

Receiving my pass, he scored, then calmly high-fived his teammates and returned to his position without a celebration.

Filippo's expression was truly intense.

Claudio, the opposing defender, asked cautiously.

"Hey... Mino! Is that guy here to kill someone today?"

I joked, "He plans to feed your defense the grass!" in response.

But I didn't know.

That Filippo Asnelli, standing at 183 cm with a surprisingly solid build, would suddenly run wild like Kenneth!

"Ahhhhh!"

That was "Football3."

Filippo Asnelli was showing "Football3" against Torino in today's match.

Thanks to him, Torino's defense screamed.

Moreover, with Kenneth, who stands over 2 meters tall and weighs over 100 kg, joining in, it wasn't screams but curses of frustration that came out.

The scariest part was that Filippo, unlike simple and blunt Kenneth, tormented Torino's defense cleverly and persistently.

By the 40th minute of the first half, Filippo had only committed 3 fouls, but the faces of Torino's central defenders, Gleyson and Claudio, were lifeless.

Torino's coach, Silvio Maran, was so frustrated that he protested to the referee and got a yellow card.

He received a card faster than Filippo, who was performing "Football3."

Of course, Filippo's "Football3" ended just before halftime.

Filippo Asnelli finally received a yellow card.

But the game was already heavily tilted.

- Hat-trick! Filippo Asnelli scores a hat-trick in today's match!

- It's incredible! Despite Mino and Kenneth remaining silent, Parma is leading Torino by a large margin of 3-0!

Filippo eventually scored a hat-trick.

Seeing Torino's defenders looking soulless after the first half, I felt pity.

But watching Filippo not easing his fierce expression even during halftime, I knew.

Ah, it's not over yet!

It made me nervous.

I was worried that Filippo might get sent off in the second half, leaving us with 10 men.

And my prediction was spot on.

- Filippo! He gets another card for a rough tackle.

- Ah! Filippo, who played brilliantly today, gets sent off in the 24th minute of the second half!

But.

The game was already heavily one-sided.

Torino had no energy left to make a comeback.

Our Filippo had scored all 5 goals.

Santiago with 2 assists.

Kenneth with 2 assists.

Me with 1 assist.

Filippo had shaken Torino's solid defense with his rough play and performed brilliantly by capitalizing on the passes we provided.

As a grand finale, he got sent off for accumulating yellow cards, but Torino fans booed him as he confidently left the field.

The opposing coach, trying to hurry him off the field, saw Filippo's fierce expression and quickly turned away in fear.

Honestly.

I had high expectations for the Coppa Italia final.

But the result was so anticlimactic that I was speechless.

- The game is over!

- A one-man show by Filippo Asnelli ends the match! Thanks to Filippo Asnelli's 5 goals, Parma clinches the Coppa Italia title!

After Filippo got sent off, we conceded a goal from a counterattack, but Torino's attack was lackluster, so it wasn't much trouble.

Ah, I couldn't score against Torino again in today's match.

See, there's something off between me and Torino?

As soon as my thoughts ended, a huge cheer erupted.

Simultaneously, I saw captain Marjan Kurikic lifting the trophy high.

- The Coppa Italia champions are Parma F.C!

Waaaaaa!

Yeah, sometimes you need to ride the bus.

How can I drive every day?

I want to be a passenger too!

* * *

[Parma's Double!]

[Parma conquers the Coppa Italia too!]

[Back-to-back Coppa Italia wins! Parma is not just about Mino!]

[Filippo Asnelli scores 5 goals alone!]

[Even with 10 men, Parma didn't allow a comeback!]

Parma's double.

It was a surprising result for everyone.

Moreover, the standout player in the final was neither Park Minho nor Kenneth, but the third option striker, Filippo Asnelli.

Parma's fans were ecstatic.

The city was in a frenzy again.

Now, if we win the Europa League final, we could achieve a mini treble.

Of course, not everyone congratulated Parma's Coppa Italia victory.

[Torino's coach Silvio Maran: "Parma won today not by football, but by fighting."]

Torino's coach, Silvio Maran, expressed his dissatisfaction with Parma, saying they played like fighters rather than footballers in the post-match press conference.

He especially criticized Filippo Asnelli, saying, "I thought an Italian gangster had invaded the field!"

He even mocked Filippo's tattoos and skinhead.

[Coach Silvio Maran: "Seeing all those tattoos, he must've been a bully stealing kids' money before playing football!"]

But Filippo calmly responded.

- Torino was also rough.

- They kept making rough tackles on Mino.

- When Mino took off his shin guards at halftime, his legs were covered in bruises.

He countered perfectly, saying Torino's defense was no different and addressing the mockery of his tattoos and skinhead.

- I got severe burns when I ran into a burning house to save my sibling when I was young.

- These tattoos were to cover those scars.

- I don't understand why my tattoos are being discussed here.

- I'm displeased that the Torino coach judges people by their appearance.

This turned the Italian football fans' opinion against Torino and in favor of Filippo.

Italian football fans thought it was wrong to pick on someone's appearance.

And.

Filippo finished off cleanly, making Torino fans and coach Silvio Maran clutch their necks in frustration.

- Coach Silvio said before the game that Mino would roll around like a pig.

- So I made sure Torino's defense ended up like that.

Everyone could only nod in agreement with Filippo's last statement.

It was a fantastic finish.

- How does it feel to be the pig now?
