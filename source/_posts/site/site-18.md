## 7. Simple Things and Unstoppable Things (2)

Beep! Beeeep! Beep!

"It's over!"

"Nice! Four consecutive league wins! If you count the Italian Cup, it's five consecutive wins!"

"Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!"

The whistle blew, signaling the end of the match.

A victory marking Parma's four consecutive wins.

The result was 3 to 1.

Cremonese had to be content with a single goal chased in the latter part of the second half.

And today's MVP was me.

Standing in front of a pretty reporter, my mouth clammed up again.

As expected, I must not be cut out for broadcasting.

I quickly slipped away after slightly altering the acceptance speech of a famous actor from my country.

[Parma races to four consecutive league wins!]

[Park Minho: 'I didn’t do much. I just added a spoon to the dish my teammates made.']

[Reminiscent of Arjen Robben! Mino! Takes down Cremonese with a simple yet destructive dribble!]

[Parma Calcio shows a great start towards the top of League 1! Can they get promoted again this season?]

[Parma Calcio drawing a lot of attention from the start of the season! Scouts spotted at their home stadium!]

[Comments]

-Mino! Mino! Mino! Mino!

-It really felt like watching Arjen Robben! Though he’s not as fast... Honestly, I think his dribbling is even more destructive!

-Great! We’re at the top of the league! Let’s keep this winning streak going and get promoted!

-But, scouts? Who are they here to see?

-Santiago? Mino? Franco?

-Franco's a veteran, they won’t take him. Plus, he’s injury-prone.

-It’s probably Santiago or Mino.

-Fucking scouts. They swarm like rats in a granary whenever our young players do well.

The response was enthusiastic.

Not just about my performance.

Considering the recent performance of Parma Calcio, I could fully understand why the fans were so excited.

However, there were also opposing views.

Some said that since Parma was relegated from Serie A last season, this level of performance was expected.

After the interest in the team slightly waned.

The spotlight was back on me.

[Mino! The hit product of Parma Calcio! An incredible performance with 2 goals and 2 assists in 4 league matches!]

[Park Minho's value set at approximately 4.86 million euros! Equivalent to about 6.5 billion won!]

[From zero to 4.86 million euros. Parma is all smiles!]

Just by performing well in a few matches, my value has skyrocketed to 6.5 billion won.

My friends in the group chat are having a field day discussing my value.

-MilanoLove: Why is your value so low?

-RealMilan: 6.5 billion? Parma! How about swapping our Mirai Dzeko for him? He’s also worth 6.5 billion!

-Roberto: Nope, not trading for a 35-year-old.

-KingYuve: How about Adam Ramsey? We can even subsidize his salary! He’s only 30!

-Roberto: Get lost! He’s practically made of glass! You think I’d trade Mino for someone whose muscles shatter like glass with a bit of overexertion? You’re really out of your mind?

-Monica: Arsenal... good... team... they’ve even had an undefeated season... now they’re 4th in the league... big club...

-MilanoLove: Yeah, in reality, it’s Arsenal Science Season 2.

-Monica: ...

Hey, stop bullying her.

Monica’s gonna cry.

I mean, I don’t even have plans to transfer anywhere, but everyone’s acting like they’re general managers of various teams.

More than that, I can really feel how much Italians love football.

Five random guys approached me for autographs while I was grocery shopping, all smiling ear to ear.

If it's like this in Italy, what would it be like in England, the birthplace of football, or Spain, the land of passion?

Honestly, I kind of want to visit.

Anyway.

These days, I’m considered not only cost-effective but also highly potential, to the point where other teams are envious to the bone.

Leo mentioned it before.

The Juventus scout who came to see me during the tryout got quite a bit of flak.

Apparently, they evaluated me as an event player they could get for a reasonable price...

Because of that evaluation, they missed out on me.

So, they got some disciplinary action.

But.

Juventus must have a lot of money.

Considering the “reasonable price” was close to Parma's average weekly salary, it’s indeed a wealthy club.

But why are their results like that?

* * *

These days, I frequently contact Kang Juwon, a senior I befriended on the national team.

In his recent 7 matches, he scored 2 goals and made 1 assist.

Not outstanding, but not lacking either.

I heard there’s interest from the EPL.

I want to face a Serie A team soon, too.

"Mino!"

While warming up, lost in thought, I hurriedly ran to the coach who was calling me.

I wasn’t supposed to play today.

It seemed something had gone wrong.

"Attack from the left as much as possible. Quick and move! Got it? Brescia's central midfielders will press hard on the central second line. Be careful and aim for counterattacks."

"I was planning to give you as much rest as possible today, but things turned out like this. I’m counting on you."

I nodded at the coach's instructions.

The match against Brescia in the 5th round of the league.

With over 40 minutes into the second half, the score was 2 to 2.

As I stepped onto the field, I could see the fatigue on the players' faces.

It meant today’s match had been that intense.

The opportunity came sooner than expected.

A ball flying toward me in the center.

As soon as I caught the ball, I dodged Brescia's central midfielder who came charging and connected it long to the left flank.

However.

Despite my good play, it didn’t lead to a goal.

Time continued to flow.

But the ball didn’t come to me again.

And after the added time ended.

Beep! Beeeep! Beeeep!

The referee signaled the end of the match.

A draw in the away match against Brescia.

Not a great result, but not entirely bad either.

We still got 1 point.

The players' expressions weren’t all bad either.

Just a bit regrettable.

Even though I played for less than 10 minutes as a substitute.

It was the first draw, not a win, in a match I played in.

Well, I’ve lost in friendlies against Oman.

But that was just a friendly match.

A draw feels this regrettable.

“What would it feel like to lose?”

Probably painful.

Maybe.

There are quite a few writings comparing defeat to pain.

But why is everyone looking at me strangely?

"Mino."

Santiago shakes his head, looking at me.

No, I’m genuinely curious about how it feels to lose.

Is that weird?

"You’re really a crazy guy."

Me?

Why?

Being curious about how losing feels...

isn’t a weird thought.

* * *

After drawing with Brescia.

We boarded the bus for the Perugia away match.

It’s really far.

Anyway, the next opponent, Perugia, is a promoted team.

Currently sitting at 10th in the league with 2 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses.

After staying in a hotel for about two days, the match day arrived.

"Once we finish this away match and the Ascoli away match, it's another international break."

"Mino, do you think you’ll be called up for the national team again?"

"Who knows."

The players chatted excitedly in the locker room.

I casually responded to their conversations and started focusing on the assistant coach’s instructions.

"Today, you’ll start on the left wing."

"Yes."

"Continue with the pattern the coach instructed last time, but I’ll add one more thing. You used to shoot after cutting inside the center."

"Right."

"Now, add a pass into the mix after driving inside. Gennaro will finish the ball that you push inside. Or, you can use the outside front kick you showed last practice to create a decisive shot or cross."

"Hmm... Got it."

A simple pattern got added.

But I knew.

With this addition, Perugia's defense would have more complex calculations to make.

I’m starting to get a feel for what modern football is.

Of course, I might not be able to pull off something flashy like my other friends, but I was confident I could create a lot with other plays.

I feel like a real pro.

"Sounds good."

"Right?"

A simple movement was added.

But the opponent won’t be able to stop it even if they know it.

Seems fun.

"It’s time to enter."

It was time to leave the uncomfortable locker room.

Perugia’s away team locker room was a bit shabby.

But it was better than Vicenza’s.

Their floor was kind of slippery.

I stepped into the hallway to enter the field.

The home team was waiting for us.

I could see Perugia's players in their red uniforms.

Soon, both teams entered the field.

A thunderous cheer erupted from the home team’s fans.

This has its own kind of fun.

Sometimes, when I glance around, I can hear a bit of what the opposing team’s fans are shouting.

"Fucking bastards! Die!"

"Booooooo!"

"Perugia! Perugia! Perugia!"

Playing away at the opponent's home has its own kind of fun.

Starting on the left wing.

But I was told to keep switching with Franco or Santiago on the right during the match.

When in the center, move like Franco.

On the wing, draw the defender’s attention with simple patterns like in the last match.

If confident, just score a goal.

Well, let’s see how it goes.

I’ve been using the same play for the last two matches, so they must be prepared.

Today, I might really be a decoy.

But more than that, I'm genuinely curious about how losing feels.

Losing in amateur football felt just okay.

But I’ve never lost in a professional match, so I’m curious.

Santiago told me not to say such things to others...

Honestly, I can't hold back my curiosity.

Beep!

As soon as the first half started.

The opponent's pressure began.

A ball connected to Franco in the center.

Quickly, I slipped behind the opponent's fullback.

Simultaneously, the ball landed precisely at my feet.

At the same time, I displayed the same play I did on the right wing in the last match.

Dribbling with the ball, I cut inside the center.

With a perfect angle between the defenders.

This time, I curled a right-footed shot.

Doing this.

The opponent's goalkeeper or defender would block my shot.

From now on, they’d be on guard against me, right?

Smack!

Oh?

"Wow! You crazy bastard! You scored again?"

"You’re really insane! Insanely good!"

"Hahaha! Scoring in the first minute!"

As the players swarmed over me, I thought.

Did that really go in?

* * *

-Wow! Scored in the first 1 minute and 15 seconds! Parma Calcio has scored!

-What a fantastic goal! Here, Mino scores!

-Season’s 5th goal! And 3rd league goal!

-Mino showing fantastic performance on the wing recently!

Boooooo!

The boos got louder after the goal.

Especially when I had the ball.

I wondered if they’d actually light a flare or something.

Thinking back, I finally realized how powerful this simple macro play pattern was.

"Switching!"

At Franco's call, I moved to the center.

Hmm! This fragrant smell.

This is the scent of home.

"Mino!"

A ball flying towards the center circle where I stood.

The start of a counterattack.

As soon as I caught the ball, Franco and Santiago sprinted down the flanks.

Let’s have some fun running.

Strangely, it doesn’t feel like running on the wing.

Running from the center feels like a wild horse galloping in the fields, and it feels really good.

"Block him!"

"Narrow the angle for a pass to the flank!"

"Mark number 24! 24!"

I gained speed.

A Perugia midfielder rushed to cut my speed, but I dodged him with a simple body feint.

There was no need for fancy moves like the McGeady spin or the Marseille turn.

Simple is best.

I realized today that simple is the best, scoring a goal.

This can’t be stopped even if they know it.

I saw the panicked Perugia players.

Especially the defenders, moving busily.

There were four defenders.

We had three.

We were outnumbered by one, but it didn’t matter.

The opponent’s line was a mess due to this counterattack.

-Mino! Mino! He’s fast! This time too, he’s fast!

-Quickly running into the danger zone, Mino!

The two center-backs blocking my way must have thought they had perfectly blocked my shooting angle.

But I could see it.

The perfect trajectory angle.

Pretending to be pushed to the left flank by the defender.

Then, turning my body back to trick the opponent and quickly taking a shot with my right foot from the half-space.

With an outside front kick.

Thud!

Flop!

-Mino scores a brace!

-Wow! Mino is amazing! Fantastico! Fantastico! Wow, a magnificent outside front kick!

-The score widens to a two-point difference in just 15 minutes into the first half! Parma seizes two goals against Perugia in a flash!!

Wow! This worked.

Honestly, I wasn’t sure about this one.

As I scored, the players swarmed over me.

"Now it’s the outside front kick?"

"You’re really insane!"

Sharing the joy of scoring with the players, Santiago approached and asked.

"Which video did you watch this time to play so well?"

Since I mentioned that I’ve been studying other players’ videos and imitating their play, he’s been on a rampage, watching videos of different players and imitating their play.

Last time, he tried to imitate Zidane, doing the Marseille turn repeatedly, only to get a light smack from Coach Alain Lavagne.

"Uh? Please tell me! Please?"

He must be planning to imitate something again.

Seeing his desperate face, I had no choice but to tell him when he raised two fingers.

"2 euros?"

"20 euros."

Yeah, money talks.

"Which video did you watch?"

"Yeah!"

There’s a player known for his highlight reels in Korea.

The one known for the ‘Quaresma Special.’

"Ricardo Quaresma."

"Quaresma?"

"Yeah, I watched the 'Quaresma Special' and tried to follow it."

Santiago pulled a face.

Why?

He’s practically a football god in videos.
