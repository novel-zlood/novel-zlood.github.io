## 7. Simple Things and Things You Can't Stop Even When You Know (2)

Beep! Beep! Beep!

"It's over!"

"Nice! Four consecutive league wins! If you count the Italian Cup, it's five wins in a row!"

"Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!"

The whistle blew, signaling the end of the match.

A victory announcing Parma's four consecutive wins.

The result was 3-1.

Cremonese had to be satisfied with chasing one goal at the end of the second half.

And today's MVP was me.

Standing in front of a pretty reporter, my mouth shut tight again.

As expected, I guess I'm not made for broadcasting.

I quickly changed a famous acceptance speech from a well-known actor in our country and slipped away.

[Parma on a Four-Game Winning Streak!]

[Park Minho: 'I didn't do much. I just added a spoon to the dish my teammates made.']

[Play Reminiscent of Arjen Robben! Mino! Knocks Down Cremonese with Simple but Destructive Dribbling!]

[Parma Calcio Off to a Good Start in Serie B! Can They Get Promoted This Season?]

[Parma Calcio Drawing a Lot of Attention Early in the Season! Scouts Seen at Their Home Stadium!]

[Comments]

-Mino! Mino! Mino! Mino!

-It really felt like watching Arjen Robben! Of course, he's not as fast... But honestly, his dribbling skills seem even more destructive!

-Great job! We're at the top of the league! Let's keep this winning streak going and get promoted!

-But who are the scouts here to see?

-Santiago? Mino? Franco?

-They won't take Franco. He's old and injury-prone.

-It must be Santiago or Mino.

-Damn scouts. They swarm like rats in a grain silo as soon as one of our prospects does well.

The reaction is intense.

Not just because of my performance.

Looking at Parma Calcio's recent games, it's clear why the fans are cheering so much.

However, there are also opposing views.

Some say that since Parma was relegated from Serie A last season, this level of performance is expected.

After a bit of waning interest in the team,

The spotlight shifted back to me.

[Mino! Parma Calcio's Hit Product! Shows Amazing Performance with 2 Goals and 2 Assists in 4 League Matches!]

[Park Minho's Value Estimated at 4.86 Million Euros! About 6.5 Billion Won in Korean Currency!]

[From Zero to 4.86 Million Euros. Parma Can't Stop Smiling!]

Just by doing well in 4 games, my value shot up to 6.5 billion won.

My friends in the group chat are having a field day with my value.

-MilanoLove: Why is your value so cheap?

-RealMilan: 6.5 billion? Parma! Want to trade our Mirai Dzeko for him? He's also 6.5 billion!

-Roberto: No, I won't trade him for a 35-year-old.

-KingYuve: How about Adam Ramsey? We can even supplement his weekly wage! He's only 30!

-Roberto: Get lost! His muscles are like glass! You want to trade Mino for a guy whose muscles shatter with a little overwork? Are you crazy?

-Monica: Arsenal... a good... team... They even had an unbeaten season... Now 4th in the league... a big club...

-MilanoLove: Yes, in reality, it's Science Season 2 at Sassnal.

-Monica: ...

Hey, stop bullying her.

Monica's going to cry.

Besides, I have no intention of transferring to another team, but they're acting like they're the general managers of each team.

More than that, I really feel that Italians love football more than anyone.

Even when I was grocery shopping, five smiling elderly men asked for my autograph.

If Italy is like this, I wonder what it's like in England, the birthplace of football, and Spain, the land of passion?

Honestly, I do want to visit once.

Anyway.

These days, my evaluation is that I have great cost-effectiveness and high potential, making other teams envious.

Leo told me last time.

The Juventus scout who came to see me at the tryouts got a lot of flak.

I heard he evaluated me as an event player they just needed to give a reasonable amount of money.

Because of that evaluation, they missed out on me.

So he got some disciplinary action.

But.

Juventus must be really rich.

Considering the reasonable amount was close to Parma's average weekly wage, it's quite a wealthy club.

But why are their results like that.

* * *

I've been in frequent contact with senior Kang Juwon, who I got close to in the national team.

In his recent 7 games, he has 2 goals and 1 assist.

It's not great, but it's not a bad record.

I heard there's interest from the EPL.

I also want to face a Serie A team soon.

"Mino!"

While stretching and thinking about something else, I ran to the coach who urgently called me.

I was told I wouldn't be playing today.

But it seemed like things had gone awry.

"Attack as much as you can on the left. Quick and move! Got it? Brescia's central midfielders will press hard on the central second line. Be careful of that and aim for counterattacks as much as possible."

"I was planning to let you rest as much as possible today, but things turned out this way. I'm counting on you."

I nodded at the coach's instructions.

The 5th round match against Brescia.

With over 40 minutes in the second half, the score was 2-2.

When I stepped onto the field, the players' faces were full of fatigue.

It meant today's game had been intense.

The opportunity came faster than expected.

A ball flying towards me in the center.

After easily dodging Brescia's central midfielder who rushed at me right after I got the ball, I connected it long to the left wing.

But.

Despite my good play, there was no finish.

Time kept flowing.

But the ball didn't come to me again.

And after the additional time ended.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The referee signaled the end of the match.

The home game against Brescia ended in a draw.

It's not a very good result, but.

It's not entirely bad either.

We earned 1 point.

The players' expressions weren't entirely bad either.

Just a bit disappointing.

Even though I didn't play for 10 minutes after being substituted.

It was the first time a match I played in didn't end in a win but a draw.

Well, I've lost in friendly matches against Oman and others.

But those were friendlies.

Even a draw feels disappointing.

"What's it like to lose?"

It must be painful.

Maybe.

There are quite a few writings comparing defeat to pain.

But why is everyone looking at me weirdly?

"Mino."

Santiago shook his head as he looked at me.

No, I'm just genuinely curious about what it's like to lose.

Isn't that normal?

"You're really crazy."

Me?

Why?

Being curious about what it's like to lose...

That's not a weird thought.

* * *

After the draw with Brescia.

We got on the bus for the away match against Perugia.

It's really far.

Anyway, the next opponent, Perugia, is a promoted team.

They're currently in 10th place with 2 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses.

After staying in a hotel for about two days, match day arrived.

"Once we finish this away match and the Ascoli away match, another international break is coming."

"Will Mino be called up to the national team again?"

"Dunno."

In the locker room, the players chatted excitedly.

I responded roughly to their conversation and started focusing on the assistant coach's instructions.

"Today, you'll start on the left wing."

"Yes."

"We'll continue with the pattern the coach instructed last time, but I'll add one more thing. You used to cut inside and shoot, right?"

"Yes."

"Now, also add a pass inside. Gennaro will finish if he cuts inside. Or you can create a decisive cross or a shot with the outside front kick like you showed in the last practice."

"Hmm... got it."

A simple pattern was added.

But I could tell.

With this one added pattern, Perugia's defense would have more complex calculations to make.

I get the sense of what modern football is.

Of course, I can't make some flashy plays like other friends, but I was confident I could create a lot with my other plays.

It feels like I've truly become a pro?

"Sounds good."

"Right?"

Even though only one simple movement was added.

The opponent won't be able to stop it even if they know.

It sounds fun.

"It's time to enter."

It's time to leave the uncomfortable locker room.

Perugia's away locker room wasn't great.

But it was slightly better than Vicenza.

The floor there was a bit slippery.

I stepped into the hallway to enter the field.

Waiting for us first were the home team.

I could see the red uniforms of Perugia's players.

Then, the two teams entered the field.

The thunderous cheers of the home team poured in.

This has its own kind of fun.

Sometimes, I can slightly hear what the opposing team's fans are saying when I glance around and make eye contact.

"Those f***ing bastards! Die!"

"Booo!"

"Perugia! Perugia! Perugia!"

Playing an away game at the opponent's home is quite interesting.

Starting on the left wing.

But I was told I could keep switching with Franco or Santiago on the right during the match.

When in the center, move like Franco.

On the wing, draw the opponent's defender's attention with simple patterns like the last game.

If I have confidence, just score a goal.

Well, let's see how it goes.

I've been doing the same play for two games straight, so even a fool would prepare thoroughly.

Today, there's a high chance I'll be a decoy.

But more than that, I really wonder what it feels like to lose.

A loss in amateur football was just so-so.

Since Iâ€™ve never lost in pro matches, I'm curious.

Santiago told me never to say that to others...

But honestly, I can't hold back my curiosity.

Beep!

As soon as the first half started.

The opponent's pressure began.

A ball connected to Franco in the center.

I quickly slipped behind the opposing fullback.

At the same time, the ball landed perfectly at my feet.

Simultaneously, I showed the same play I did on the right wing in the last game.

Dribbling the ball and breaking through.

Then cutting inside finely.

Finding the angle between the defenders.

This time, a right-footed curler.

If I do this.

The opponent's goalkeeper or defender will block my shot.

From now on, they'll be wary of me?

Thwack!

Huh?

"Woohoo! You crazy bastard! You scored again?"

"You're really insane! Insane!"

"Hahaha! A goal in just 1 minute of the first half!"

As the players swarmed over me, I thought.

Did that really go in?

* * *

-Woohoo! A goal in just 1 minute and 15 seconds! Parma Calcio scores a goal right off the bat!

-A fantastic goal! Mino scores here!

-It's his 5th goal of the season! And his 3rd league goal!

-Mino is showing fantastic performance on the wing lately!

Boooooo!

Since the goal, the booing has gotten louder.

Especially when I had the ball, it went crazy.

I wondered if they'd really set off flares.

Thinking back, I realized how effective this simple pattern macro play is.

"Switching!"

At Franco's shout, I moved to the center.

Mmm! This fragrant smell.

It's the smell of home.

"Mino!"

A ball flew towards me at the center circle.

A counterattack was starting.

Franco and Santiago started sprinting to the wings as soon as I got the ball.

It's been a while since I ran with excitement.

Oddly, I don't feel like I'm running on the wings.

When I sprint from the center, it feels like a wild horse running in the fields, and I really like it.

"Block him!"

"Narrow the angle for a pass to the wing!"

"Mark number 24! Mark him!"

I gained more speed.

I easily dodged a Perugia midfielder rushing to stop my acceleration with a simple body feint.

There was no need to show off fancy skills like a McGeady spin.

Or a Marseille turn.

Simple is best.

I realized this while scoring the first goal today.

They can't stop it even if they know.

I saw the Perugia players getting flustered.

Especially the defenders moving busily.

There were four defenders.

We had three players.

We were outnumbered by one, but it didn't matter.

This counterattack had already messed up their line.

-Mino! Mino! He's fast! He's fast again!

-He's sprinting right into the danger zone quickly!

The two central defenders blocking my path must have thought.

They perfectly blocked the angle for a shot.

But I saw it.

The perfect trajectory angle.

I moved as if I was being pushed to the opposing left wing by the defender.

Then turned my body again, tricking the opponent's timing, and took a shot with my right foot half-space faster.

With an outside front kick.

Bang!

Thud!

-Mino's multi-goal!

-Woohoo! Mino is crazy! Fantastico! Fantastico! Woohoo! A mesmerizing outside front kick!

-In just 15 minutes of the first half, the score widened with a 2-point lead! Parma quickly snatched 2 points from Perugia!!

Wow! This went in.

Honestly, I wasn't sure about this one.

After scoring, the players all rushed over.

"Now it's an outside front kick?"

"You're really crazy!"

While sharing the joy of scoring with the players and heading back, Santiago sneaked up and asked.

"What video did you watch to play this well?"

I recently told him that I study other players' videos and try to mimic their plays, so now he's all about watching various player videos and copying their moves.

Last time, he got a smack on the head from Coach Alain Lavagne for overusing the Marseille turn, trying to mimic Zidane.

"Come on, tell me! Please?"

What's he planning to mimic now?

Looking at his desperate face, I had no choice but to tell him when he raised two fingers.

"2 Euros?"

"20 Euros."

Yup, money is the best.

"What did you watch and mimic?"

"Yeah!"

There's a player particularly famous for his highlights in Korea.

The protagonist of the term 'Quaresma Special.'

"Ricardo Quaresma."

"Quaresma?"

"Yeah, I watched 'Quaresma Special' and tried to mimic it."

Santiago made a puzzled face at my words.

Why?

In the videos, he's like a football god.
