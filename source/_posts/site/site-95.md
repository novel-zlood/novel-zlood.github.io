## 35. Monica's Happiness Arsenal (3)

These days, Monica's expression is bright.

I think it's because I transferred to Arsenal.

I don't know if it's because her expression has brightened lately, but when she appears in photoshoots or advertisements, she seems to be glowing.

But.

What on earth is that?

There was a long pillow with my picture printed on it.

Oh, I remembered.

"Body pillow?"

Yes, in English, it's called a "body pillow."

But why is that in Monica's bedroom?

It felt rather strange.

Anyway.

Just as Monica is happy, Arsenal fans in North London have been having happy days lately.

How do I know that?

Well, Arsenal's football has been so enjoyable to watch that they even put up banners near Emirates Stadium.

The banners roughly conveyed the hope to maintain the top position in the first half of the season, and some of my teammates seemed to be moved by those banners.

Those who communicate with fans via social media posted messages to thank Gooners, while those who don't usually do such things quietly focused more on training.

Why are Gooners so happy?

It's obviously thanks to Tottenham.

This season, Tottenham looks like the Arsenal of the past, which is why they are so happy.

[Tottenham in shock with three consecutive losses! Dropping to 20th place in the league with 1 draw and 3 losses in 4 games!]

[Tottenham collapses after Shinjunseo leaves! What's the reason?]

[Harriet Kane: 'I desperately want to win.']

[Tottenham fans: 'Score a goal before you talk about winning!']

Tottenham has had conflicts with their new manager, George Martinez, and perhaps as a result of defiance, the players seemed to be underperforming.

Well, Monica sharply criticized Tottenham, saying, "No, it's not defiance. It's just their skill."

Initially, some communities in Korea didn't view Hyung Junseo's move to Manchester United favorably, but now they re-evaluate it, praising it as a perfect escape from a sinking ship.

Anyway.

Gooners were smiling happily, looking at the early-season results of Arsenal and Tottenham.

[Real Madrid hasn't given up on Mino.]

But we couldn't always smile.

After seeing this news, Lorenzo Lufo glanced at me during lunch and asked.

"Mino, Arsenal is the best, right?"

"I'm not thinking of leaving, so don't worry."

"No, just let me know if you leave. So I can go with you."

Crazy guy.

This guy is not half-normal either, I tell you.

"Okay, I got it. Hurry up and eat. If you keep this up, we won't get proper rest before the afternoon training."

At my words, Lorenzo nodded and stuffed a spoonful of scrambled eggs into his mouth.

Next to him, Tyler Smith Rowe had already finished his meal and was drinking a cup of tea while reading a book, and behind me, Amani Richards was staring at me with sparkling eyes, not even eating properly.

Really... what a strange team.

But why is there mint chocolate ice cream in front of me?

I didn't bring it.

* * *

Lazio is truly a good team.

During my time at Parma, Lazio was always a good points vending machine for us.

They helped Parma win the league by tripping up the top Serie A teams.

If coach Ricardo Sari knew what I was thinking, he'd probably want to kill me.

Of course, that would never happen.

Arsenal has a deep squad.

Even in the first match of the Europa League group stage, we rotated and went out with a completely different combination.

It was a match that included many young players.

Coach Alain didn't seem to be too focused on the Europa League.

I also thought the most important part was the league, so I was concentrating on it, and that was evident in the overall atmosphere of the squad.

But that doesn't mean we can lose.

We are professionals, and the fans come to Emirates Stadium to see us win.

Oh, because we were playing against Lazio, I got to hear some news about Parma after a long time.

I heard it from Roberto.

The new coach of Parma after I left was Alberto Conte, who used to coach Tottenham in the past.

Wow... Parma has really come up.

To appoint such a famous coach.

Well, their current standing is 6th in the league.

Although many key players have left, Parma, with a solid defense and a decent midfield, has shown suffocating defense since the beginning of the season, achieving a good rank.

I heard that coach Conte is showing a lot of love for Kenneth.

It seems Kenneth is adapting well, too.

Anyway.

It felt great to hear that Parma is performing well.

Back to the match against Lazio, as soon as we entered the field, I could feel the fierce gaze of the opposing defenders.

Will those stares pierce through my uniform?

Liam Murray, a young midfielder starting today, was trembling slightly.

He seemed very nervous, but Bernard Party next to him was smiling and taking good care of Liam Murray.

Certainly, the name "Europa League" carries weight.

I could understand how he felt.

"Playing on the same field as Mino."

No, I'll take that back.

This guy wasn't nervous about the Europa League, but about playing on the same field as me.

Should I consider it fortunate?

Once on the field, Liam Murray showed a better performance than expected and contributed to the team.

After the match started, Liam Murray's active movements brought energy to our attack.

Although there were frequent mistakes, considering his attitude, one couldn't belittle his performance.

Receiving a pass from Liam Murray, I slowly advanced, making Lazio's defenders nervous.

On the opposite flank was Pedro Ocampos.

In the center, Lorenzo Lufo was charging forward.

Although the defenders' attention was somewhat dispersed, they seemed to have a grudge against me, making them hesitant to move.

But I didn't miss the moment when they lost their focus a bit and made my move.

-Mino! Quickly making his way through!

-Mino, who often attempts such fast breakthroughs at Arsenal! The right flank of Lazio is pierced in an instant!

Even if I pass one, there are two more in front of me.

If I push a bit harder...

I could break through more, but.

There's no need to take the hard way.

Tuk!

With so many teammates around, not utilizing them would be foolish.

-Mino passes the ball to Lorenzo, who holds it!

-Lorenzo to Pedro, moving into the center!

-Pedro passes it short, back to Mino!

-Mino! Mino! Shooooots!

-Gooooooal!

-Minnooooo! His first goal of the Europa League this season!

-Arsenal takes the lead against Lazio!

Thud!

Turning into the space Lorenzo Lufo created by holding the ball, I easily found myself in a one-on-one chance.

Pedro's short pass also arrived just in time for me to shoot half a beat faster, making it perfect.

Thanks to that, I could easily score the first goal.

But the match didn't go smoothly.

Fabio Immobile, who often competed for the top scorer in Serie A, fired a follow-up shot, making it 1-1.

I could see coach Ricardo Sari pumping his fist in joy.

Well, that doesn't mean we would lose.

It's just... we conceded one goal.

We soon scored another to break the tie.

-Liaaam Murrayyyy!

-Liam Murray, making his debut today, scores a fantastic long-range shot!

-That shot reminds me of Liverpool's Gerrard in the past! It's that impactful!

Emirates Stadium vibrated with the cheers of the fans.

Certainly, being young, English, a bit rough around the edges, full of fighting spirit, and a midfielder who scores well.

Monica often wished for such a midfielder at Arsenal, looking so sad.

Watching that scene, she'd be very happy.

Anyway.

The promising talent she wanted debuted at Arsenal.

Moreover, Arsenal's recent performance has been excellent.

And her boyfriend transferred to Arsenal.

Isn't this truly "Monica's Happiness Arsenal"?

As they say, life is unpredictable.

* * *

[Mino's brace! Arsenal crushes Lazio 4-1!]

[Liam Murray's fantastic Arsenal debut! We felt someone's presence in him!]

[Arsenal's 4-1 home victory against Lazio! Why are they leading in the early season?]

[Coach Alain: ‘It was a good match. It's clear that the players’ teamwork is improving.’]

[Can Arsenal, under coach Alain, break the scoring record like Parma did last season, boasting the most goals in Serie A?]

[Lorenzo Lufo: ‘Mino is a god. He can shake the net anytime, anywhere if he wants.’]

-Where’s the real Arsenal? Why is this strange team dominating the Premier League and the Europa League?

-Is this a parallel world where Arsenal wins? In another world, Arsenal is a mess, and fans are cursing them, right?

-Minnooooo!

-What is losing?

-This is scary. Arsenal being first in the league is one of the signs of the world's end.

Arsenal won the match against Lazio 4-1.

With Park Minho scoring two goals, Liam Murray scoring one, and Lorenzo Lufo scoring one, Arsenal showed their overwhelming offensive power this season.

Thanks to this, Arsenal fans were dumbfounded.

Many wondered if this was really the Arsenal they supported.

-Monica: This is football... This is Mino.

-Roberto: Give us back our Mino...!

-Monica: Ah! I'll let you borrow him and return him later, okay? Or else, I'll make Mino stay at Arsenal forever?

-RealMilan: I feel like I’m getting PTSD.

-LoveMilan: Is it real that as soon as Mino left, Inter, AC Milan, and Juventus are taking the top three spots?

-KingYuve: This is like hearty soup.

Park Minho’s group chat was also buzzing.

Most of the talk was about the state of Serie A after Park Minho’s transfer.

Mixed in were Monica’s praises for Arsenal, filled with Arsenal pride.

Park Minho chuckled and shook his head.

Peeking into Monica’s room, he saw her holding her smartphone with a happy expression.

He felt sorry for Monica, thinking about how sad she might become if Arsenal slipped up later.

Of course, Monica didn’t think that way.

To her, Arsenal was invincible this season.

Her happy Arsenal days would continue.

Yes, that's what Monica thought.

Without any doubt about Arsenal’s potential downturn, Monica happily read Arsenal-related articles on her smartphone.
