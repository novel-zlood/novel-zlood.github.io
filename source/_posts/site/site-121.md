## 46. A Team That Doesn't Seem to Lose (1)

As soon as the score became 3 to 1, Tottenham collapsed by conceding another goal to me in the final minutes of the second half.

The score quickly became 4 to 1, and at the same time, my hat-trick was recorded.

-Minhooooooo! An incredible performance breaking the EPL season's top scorer record!

-Hat-trick! Minho recorded a hat-trick!

-Minho's third gooooooal in just 2 minutes! It’s a dagger that completely shatters Tottenham! Aaaaaah! Spurs fans are in agony!

Just 2 minutes after scoring my second goal, another opportunity came, and I lightly tapped the ball in to record my hat-trick.

At the same time, I etched my name into the EPL record books.

-Minhooooooo creates a 10-goal gap with Ronaldo, the second top scorer!

-Amazing! Truly amazing!

-League goal number 35!

Everyone was making a fuss.

I just scored one more goal, that's all.

“Hahaha! Eat that, Spurs!”

“This is it! This is it! Minhooooooo!”

“Come ooooooon!”

The daring Gooners who followed us to the away game taunted the Spurs fans over the club guards, engulfed in excitement.

Of course, a fight was inevitable.

Thanks to that, the match was delayed by about 4-5 minutes.

But it didn’t significantly affect the outcome of the game.

Beep! Beeeeep! Beeeeeeeep!

The North London Derby ended 4 to 1.

The players quickly shook hands and hugged before swiftly leaving the field.

At the same time, the guards and the London police got to work.

I, too, hurried to the locker room out of fear.

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium had an atmosphere ripe for a riot, in my opinion.

* * *

[Minho God! Making his presence known by breaking the EPL season's top scorer record!]

[Minho surpasses Ronaldo in an instant! Creates a 10-goal gap with Ronaldo, the league's second top scorer!]

[Man U! A 6-0 victory over Aston Villa, but Ronaldo remains silent! Shin Junseo leads the team to victory with a multi-goal performance!]

[Super Korean Day! A joyous day for Korean football communities with goals from two Korean players!]

[A hat-trick and a multi-goal performance! Arsenal and Man U smile brightly thanks to Park Minho and Shin Junseo! Meanwhile, Tottenham sheds tears of blood!]

[Round of 16 in the Champions League: PSG vs. Man U! Who will be the final winner in the Messi vs. Ronaldo showdown?]

[Messi with 7 goals and 17 assists at PSG vs. Ronaldo with 26 goals and 2 assists at Man U! The last Messi vs. Ronaldo showdown in the Champions League!]

[Arsenal! More dominant than the 03-04 season!]

-Minhooooooo!

-King God General Minho! Minho is a god!

-Lifetime contract with Arsenal! Give Minho a 20-year long-term contract immediately!

-Jade Kroenke is great, but...why aren't they selling more Minho merchandise?

-Minho! Minho! Marry me!

-Nope, Minho already has someone!

-Make me your slave! Minhooooo!

-Damn! It's full of annoying people!

-Seeing someone hate on Minho's praise must mean they're a filthy Spurs fan.

-Stupid Spurs! How dare you provoke Minho!

As soon as the game ended, news about Park Minho's records and various football updates spread through the media.

Two pieces of news particularly thrilled Korean fans who enjoy international football.

One was that Messi and Ronaldo, who are retiring this season, would face off in the Champions League Round of 16. The other was that Park Minho had finally become the EPL season's top scorer.

-This season is really crazy.

-Hahaha, Shin Junseo's multi-goal, Park Minho's hat-trick and breaking the EPL season's top scorer record, and the final Messi vs. Ronaldo showdown... February is perfect!

-Wow... this is thrilling!

-Bartender! Open the shutters! I haven't had enough national pride yet!

-Is this 'good news'?

-No, it's 'Messi news.'

-There are still Ronaldo fans?

-Hahaha, Ronaldo fans, aren't you already 10 goals behind Park Minho?

-Park Minho is amazing... Honestly, I wondered if there would be another player like Shin Junseo, but now we have another talent surpassing him from Korea.

-Korean football has such a terrible youth infrastructure... How do we keep producing these players?

The name 'Park Minho' began to gain even more fame, not only in Korea but worldwide.

After all, it was Park Minho who changed the records of the EPL, not just any league.

As a result, Park Minho's agent, Leo Carpentieri, was incredibly busy.

-Minho... let's be together forever.

-I'll follow you to the cradle.

Such words were enough to make Park Minho's spine tingle.

Naturally, advertisements and various companies were eager, and Leo Carpentieri used his skills to calmly manage the situation.

"For now, let's put the Korean side on hold. It should be fine to handle it after the season."

It wasn't discrimination.

Handling Korean matters from London was procedurally too complicated, so he decided to ignore it.

Park Minho wanted to focus on football first.

The reason was naturally the terrifying EPL record of 25 wins, 1 draw, and 0 losses.

Of course, neither Park Minho nor some Arsenal players expected to maintain this record.

Even in the legendary 03-04 season, Arsenal had 12 draws.

"We'll probably have at least 6 draws."

"That's most likely."

"We might even lose one game due to overwhelming pressure. You can’t always play perfect games in a long season."

There would certainly be shaky moments.

Not because Arsenal wanted them.

Especially since Arsenal couldn't escape 'injuries.'

Several players had suffered frequent injuries last season, so Arsenal’s medical team was on high alert.

Last season, despite reaching 3rd place in the league, Arsenal's squad fell apart due to injuries, ending up in 5th place.

This season was no different.

However...as if the universe wanted Arsenal to remain undefeated, Arsenal’s medical team was strangely at ease.

But the calmness only heightened the anxiety.

A sports scientist from Arsenal even muttered anxiously,

"Is Minho going to have a season-ending injury?"

Of course, the scientist zipped his mouth after receiving glares from his colleagues.

With this uneasy calm, Arsenal slowly worked through their mid-February schedule.

* * *

Honestly, the current record was indeed abnormal.

Winning all but one of 26 games, with one draw, was really abnormal.

Naturally, I believed our victories were partly due to 'luck,' not just Arsenal's own skills.

But if someone asked if we didn’t deserve this overwhelming win rate...

That wasn’t true either.

After all, we produced these results.

How could we deny that?

I had some expectations.

That we might encounter matches where we could draw or even lose.

Just as I expected, after a 5-0 win against Coventry in the FA Cup, we drew 0-0 with Leicester City in the 27th round of the league.

It was our second draw of the season.

Naturally, the media made a fuss saying, "Arsenal is finally crumbling!"

Monica fumed reading such articles.

But honestly, I also vaguely felt that we were starting to wobble.

Moreover, our opponent was Leicester City, currently 7th in the league, making it a tough match.

They had prepared well, making the game quite tough.

For the first time in a while, I too was silent in this match.

As a result, just after one game, there were articles about "Park Minho's hype!"

And the football fans consuming those articles were people I knew very well.

-Stupid Gooners! Serves you right!

-Minho is 10 years too early to catch up to Harriet Kane.

-Minho? No! The real deal is Harriet Kane!

Well... those comments mostly came from Spurs fans, so they didn’t hurt much.

I didn’t think much of it.

The season was still long.

We had 11 league games, cup matches, and Europa League games left.

There was no time to waste on such comments.

And time quickly flew by to February 24th.

The 28th round of the league before the League Cup final.

It was an away game against Crystal Palace, and Monica persistently reminded me before the match.

-Monica: Cheerleader... You know it, right? :) My favorite movie is 'Joker'!

I don’t want to die, so I won’t watch it.

But... I took a quick peek; it was big.

I won't say what was big.

I just prayed to the goddess of fate that Monica wouldn't catch my side glance.

* * *

Honestly, today’s match wasn’t going to be easy either.

With a tight February schedule and the League Cup final in early March followed by an FA Cup match against Liverpool, we had to rotate the squad fully today.

Well... I started.

The coach told me to play only 60 minutes.

Honestly, compared to other players, I wasn’t one with immense activity.

I didn’t feel a big physical burden.

But the victory didn’t look easy.

Honestly, I felt quite heavy.

Like I could only use 80% of my usual strength.

I felt much more exhausted than when I played for Parma.

It was probably because the EPL doesn’t have a break in December.

In Serie A, we had a short break in December, but in the EPL, players are exhausted due to Boxing Day.

That was significantly affecting me now.

While we rotated the squad, Palace brought out their full starting lineup.

They had prepared thoroughly.

They scored the first goal early in the first half and calmly executed their tactics against Arsenal.

-The first goal belongs to Palaceeeee!

-Amazing! Palace scores a fantastic goal against Arsenal!

Palace seemed well-prepared to knock us down at their home.

Facing Palace's defense felt like facing Liverpool.

They must have thoroughly analyzed me and Arsenal’s attacking squad.

I thought today’s match might be tough, but strangely, Arsenal’s players moved better than I expected.

It felt as if the universe was helping us.

-Goooooal!

-Wow! With Minho's cross, Amani Richards finishes with a stunning scissor kick to equalize!

-Amazing! This play instantly explains why Arsenal has remained undefeated in the league.

Starting with Amani Richards finishing my light cross with a brilliant scissor kick, Arsenal’s attacking squad quickly scored.

Thanks to that, by the end of the first half, we had a 3 to 1 lead.

Although Palace played better, I somehow recorded 2 assists.

And the team was winning 3 to 1.

“Is this... being carried?”

This felt fresh.

But how were we winning?

Palace had clearly prepared well and played better.

Despite us being physically exhausted, Palace, having been eliminated from the League Cup and FA Cup, had more physical leeway.

Plus, their analysis of us was perfect, so I honestly thought today would be tough.

“How are we winning?”

Even when I left the field in the 20th minute of the second half, Arsenal maintained the 3 to 1 score.

We conceded a goal in the final minutes, but the result was a 3 to 2 win for Arsenal.

Despite Palace’s superior performance, the team that won was Arsenal, who had rotated the squad fully.

As soon as the match ended, I thought.

This team strangely doesn’t seem to lose.
