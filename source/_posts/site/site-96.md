## 36. The Ant and the Grasshopper (1)

The overwhelming Arsenal.

Gooners evaluated that there would be absolutely no team capable of defeating them, especially after their victory against Lazio.

That is, until the match against Sheffield United.

- The game ends! Arsenal! Despite leading 2-0, due to a lack of concentration from the defense, they only manage to get one point from the away game against Sheffield with a 2-2 draw!

- Even considering the rotation, the difference in class between Sheffield and Arsenal is significant, isn't it? The fact that such an unstable performance emerged is a problem.

- Especially Craig Martin! He keeps showing unstable performances in every match! He needs to get his act together!

There were a few problems.

The first issue was the oddly ambiguous class of Arsenal's rotation members.

Amani Richards, Bukayo Saka, Kasper Nissen, Liam Murray, Daniel Saliba, Gabriel Martinelli, and so on.

When looked at collectively, Arsenal's backup squad seemed quite impressive, but when separated, certain deficiencies became apparent.

Of course, creating a perfect soccer team down to the rotation members is nearly impossible, so the first issue could be overlooked lightly.

However, the second issue had a significant impact on recent games.

[Gabriel Martinelli! First red card of the season!]

[Gabriel received an unnecessary red card in the 30th minute of the second half against Sheffield!]

[League Cup 3rd round! Another red card in the match against Bristol City! Already two red cards at the beginning of the season!]

[League Cup 3rd round, 10-man Arsenal wins 5-0!]

[Has a red card curse fallen upon Arsenal?]

Coach Alain Levagne's tactics were quite famous in Serie A.

Parma's soccer, which effectively used fouls to disrupt opponents' attacks, worked perfectly for Parma.

Despite committing the second most fouls in Serie A, Parma had surprisingly few yellow cards and red cards, thanks to Alain Levagne's meticulous management and tactics.

But Arsenal was different.

No, it wasn't just that; the players in Serie A and the Premier League were completely different.

The leagues were different.

The referees' tendencies were different.

Lastly, the players' toughness was different.

Coach Alain realized that there were fewer players who could move according to his tactics than he had thought.

However, it was difficult to change the tactics now.

The team's performance wasn't bad.

Arsenal, recording 4 wins and 1 draw in 5 league matches, was at the top of the Premier League.

They were dominating the early part of the 23-24 season, ahead of the likes of Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd, Chelsea, and Newcastle.

Of course, evaluating the season based on just the first 5 league matches is premature, and the season's end is still far away.

They might face a slump in the middle.

Even so, changing the tactics right now would be unreasonable.

Anyway.

Since they hadn't lost a match in the recent games, Coach Alain turned his attention to another issue.

A single player who was the last problem.

"Craig Martin."

A central defender brought from Millwall.

Although there were no major issues in specific areas, Craig made critical mistakes from time to time, causing Coach Alain to show a troubled expression.

* * *

Sheffield and Bristol City.

The two red cards in those two matches made Monica seriously consider embracing religion.

"Minho... Should I believe in Buddha too?"

"Just believe in me."

At my answer, Monica beamed brightly.

Then she gave me a subtle look.

Of course, I sadly had to ignore Monica's signal, as I had to prepare for the next match.

"We have a match against Newcastle tomorrow."

"Well... I'll let it slide! But you have to score at least 2 goals against Newcastle!"

"Just 2 goals? I'll score a hat-trick."

Once again, she smiled brightly.

These days, seeing that smile on Monica's face seemed to be the joy of living in London.

To be honest, unlike in Italy, the food in England didn't quite suit my taste.

If it weren't for Monica and the nutritionist provided by the club...

Managing my diet would have been really tough.

Still, I couldn't help but miss the restaurants near Parma at times.

The salami and prosciutto I had there were fantastic, and eating ravioli afterward was a blissful experience.

Ah, I want to eat that again.

I opened the fridge, feeling hungry, but didn't see anything I particularly liked.

Anyway.

Since I had a promise with Monica, I planned to score plenty of goals in the match against Newcastle.

Moreover, I'd be meeting an old friend, so I had to play even harder.

- Lautaro Valentia: Minho! Take it easy.

Yeah, I'll score a hat-trick.

If I take it easy, our Monica will cry.

Looking at the message from my former Parma teammate, Lautaro Valentia, I steeled my resolve once again.

The day of the match arrived.

While looking at the Gooners filling Emirates Stadium, I saw a Newcastle player warming up from afar, approaching me.

"Minho, long time no see!"

Yes, it was the prince syndrome patient, Lautaro.

But... his face had changed a lot.

"What happened to your face?"

"What?"

"No... When you were at Parma, you used to spray mist, style your hair with wax, and apply some weird lotion. Seeing you like this is strange."

"Did I?"

He was now covered in a beard with a completely shaved head.

I had no idea why this prince syndrome patient had turned into an Italian Viking.

What in the world happened at Newcastle?

Lautaro, seeing my expression, laughed and answered.

"I didn't have time to take care of my appearance. The competition for the starting position is too fierce."

"Still... You look like a different person."

"Well, my hairline started to recede."

"Ah..."

"I had to shave it off, what else could I do?"

Baldness, something that comes to every man eventually.

This poor soul was also being exploited by the demon of baldness.

Well, I might go bald someday too, but seeing my grandfather's and father's thick hair, it seemed like I'd only get a slight M-shape in old age, so it shouldn't be a big problem.

I'll have to diligently take Propecia after retiring.

A man's hair, if managed well, can last a long time, a very grateful friend indeed.

So, always greet your hair friends in the morning with kindness.

Or you'll regret it later.

"Anyway... let's do well, Minho."

Yes.

With a completely shaved head.

Do your best, my friend.

* * *

Lautaro Valentia thought.

Today's match would be really tough.

The reason was obvious: Park Minho, wearing the number 10, was shaking Newcastle's defense line.

'He seems even better than when I saw him at Parma.'

In those days, he sometimes showed clumsy moments.

Yes, he was somewhat attackable back then.

But.

Park Minho, whom I met in today's match, was different.

He was just a monster.

Park Minho quickly broke through, getting past both me and the side defender Marcos Acuña, and assisted the first goal with a clean cutback.

- Gooooooal!

- Amani Richards! Gooooooal!

- Calmly finishing the ball delivered by Minho, Amani Richards! He rushes to Minho and hugs him tightly!

- It was truly a fantastic play! Newcastle couldn't easily stop it!

Thanks to that, Newcastle conceded a goal just 3 minutes into the first half, making the remaining time a difficult challenge.

'It seemed like we had a chance too...'

Newcastle, slowly raising the team's quality with Middle Eastern oil money, had secured a Europa League spot by finishing 6th in the league last season.

So, there were high expectations for this season.

They had signed outstanding center-back Sebastian Boateng and paid a hefty price to bring in Torino’s full-back Wilfried Jango this season.

With a defense line much stronger than last season, they aimed for the Champions League this season, and though it was still early, they had climbed to 4th place in the league, meeting expectations.

There was even this thought.

That Newcastle would be part of the new Big Six.

But...

Through today's match, I realized.

Newcastle was still lacking.

- Minho! Minho! Quickly breaking through! Newcastle's right side is completely penetrated!

- Wilfried Jango's tackle! But Minho easily avoids it and penetrates deeper! Dangerous! Dangerous!

- Minho! Minho! Minho! Shoooot!

- Gooooooal!

The second goal came in the 12th minute of the first half.

This time, Park Minho drove in and scored himself, making Lautaro Valentia think.

Today's match is going to be really tough.

And it's frustrating to think about how to stop that monster for the rest of the game.

Scratching his rough beard, he returned to his position.

It was just past the 15th minute of the first half.

There was still a lot of time left.

* * *

Newcastle indeed felt different.

Unlike other mid-table teams, you could feel something explosive in them.

- Gooooooal!

- Finally, Newcastle scores a consolation goal! The score is now 3-1, back to a 2-goal difference!

- Bernard Party scores with a long-range shot, narrowing the gap within 3 minutes!

However, if you asked if Newcastle was a strong team... I'd naturally tilt my head.

They had defeated Chelsea 2-0 this season, yet lost 4-0 to the league's bottom team, Burnley. That was Newcastle, our opponent.

Newcastle was more like a goblin team than a strong team.

Of course, we had no intention of being Newcastle's victim.

Tactically, our matchup was good, and Newcastle's slow defense was practically my prey.

Even now.

As soon as I got the ball, I could see Wilfried Jango screaming frantically.

"Fxxk! I can't stop him alone! Help me!"

"You idiot! Can't you see the rookie cutting in behind me? Just hold him off for a bit!"

"Stop him! Stop him!"

"Hey! You fxxking idiot! He's cutting in behind you!"

As soon as I quickly broke through the side, Newcastle's back four became as noisy as market vendors.

Even from just that, you could tell that Newcastle was a decent team.

A defense line should be noisy like that.

Although... their language was rough, the fact that their mouths weren't shut even in a losing situation meant their defense line was quite solid.

In contrast to Man Utd's defense in the opening game.

Those guys closed their mouths as soon as they were down 3-0, making De Gea suffer tremendously.

Of course, just because they kept communicating didn't mean they could stop me properly.

I dribbled the ball slowly.

And Amani Richards advancing to the center with me.

Seeing his confident demeanor after scoring the first goal of today's match, I felt his confidence.

However, this time, I am the protagonist.

Utilizing his aggressive movement, I penetrated Newcastle's defense line.

The side, and then the center.

Arsenal penetrating from both directions.

As Amani Richards cut in, drawing attention, I saw Saka darting into the gap.

- A pass to Bukayo Saka!

- A return pass! Minho! Penetrates!

Receiving the return pass from Saka, I broke further in and took a shooting stance, causing Sebastian Boateng to flinch and hurriedly throw his body in.

Of course, it was a feint.

I broke my shooting posture and dribbled the ball further.

The angle for shooting was getting narrower.

But I was confident.

I had the ability to lightly score even from such a narrow angle.

- Minho! Going too deep!

Lautaro, who stuck to me, tried to push me off roughly, but it happened after I had already taken the shot.

Thud!

Newcastle's goalkeeper, Davor Libakolic, dove to block my shot.

But the ball, shot at a sharp angle, rippled Newcastle's net.

- Minho shoots!

- Gooooooal! Wow! He scores from such a deep position! Minho scores a fantastic goal!

- It was a sharp shot! Minho scores from a difficult angle! He successfully scores a multi-goal today!

A perfect goal.

Now, it's time for a celebration that Monica would love.

As I headed towards the corner, Amani Richards suddenly knelt down and approached me.

"What?"

"Your shoes! Let me clean your cleats!"

Wow.

This was a first.

Amani placed my foot on his knee.

And as he cleaned it with his jersey, Emirates Stadium erupted in cheers.

Waaaaaah!

Minoooooooo!

This... feels a bit burdensome.

Oddly enough, it feels kind of good.

"Hehe... Please give me another amazing assist next time."

Scary guy.

Unconsciously, I thought I'd give him another assist next time.

This guy seems unexpectedly adept at socializing.
