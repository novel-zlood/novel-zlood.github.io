## 16. Value Surge (2)

Parma fans remember.

They remember that during the last away game at Ascoli, their beloved Park Minho was hit by a water bottle thrown by an Ascoli fan.

So this time, they came with a grudge.

Their eyes were filled with a menacing aura.

If they saw anyone in an Ascoli uniform, they glared fiercely.

The fans entering the stadium.

Their eyes were combative.

On the other hand, the few Ascoli fans who came to the away section also began to support their team with a momentum that did not lose to the Parma home fans.

"It's not even a derby... The atmosphere is intense."

"This is nothing because it's not a derby."

A new scout from Sevilla.

Raúl's senior scout, Kike, sat down and watched the players enter the field.

"Here they come."

Park Minho.

A striker from Korea.

He made his professional debut at the late age of 24.

In his debut season, he has already recorded 33 goals and 25 assists, attracting the attention of many scouts.

He glanced around.

"Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Valencia, Rayo, Getafe, and so on..."

"There are quite a few Spanish clubs."

"It's just because the people I know are mostly from Spain... I'm sure scouts from other leagues also came to watch Minho today."

He's a coveted asset.

A shining gem that can be acquired for a mere 20 million euros.

That's why even mid-tier teams are clamoring for him.

Because if they take him, they can sell him for at least five times the price.

Moreover, recently, many clubs have been struggling to find good players to play in the number 9 or 10 positions.

"No matter how many goal scorers you have, it's never enough."

In this sense, Park Minho was an even more coveted target for Sevilla, known as the great merchant.

But they didn't come here just to see Park Minho.

"There's a surprisingly good number of players."

"From Parma?"

"Yes."

Starting with Santiago Brunetta.

Kenneth Marsetico, Lautaro Valencia, Sergi Bernabe - there were indeed many good players.

Of course, they were also targets.

*Whistle!*

The game started just in time.

The two men stopped their conversation and focused on the game more than anyone else.

* * *

Undefeated championship.

How sweet and exhilarating are those words?

It's a record that's as difficult to achieve.

A record that brings admiration from many.

Honestly, I didn't think much about the undefeated championship.

But thinking that it's a record I've made while playing, it feels a bit different.

Especially since the expressions of my teammates weren’t good.

It felt too sudden.

I learned that the only emotion left after the arrogance was gone was a sense of burden.

Before heading to the home stadium, I asked Giovanni Buffon at the hotel because the players' expressions were too stiff.

I told him that the players seemed to feel too burdened by the undefeated championship.

Buffon said.

This burden is an inevitable emotion that a team challenging for an undefeated championship has to carry.

The problem was that this burden felt like it came at too sudden a timing.

Even our prankster's face was stiff.

Young defender Stanko's face turned white, and I thought he was really sick.

The guys who were chattering so excitedly a few days ago suddenly shut their mouths, which was frustrating.

But there was no way to solve it.

Our coach probably knew that too, which is why he was diligently comforting the players...

But it wasn't as easy as it seemed.

At least Giovanni and Kenneth's expressions were calm.

Giovanni because he had more experience than anyone else.

Kenneth because he was a rookie with no experience.

Even the great Franco was slightly shaking his foot.

When several veterans were nervous.

Naturally, the atmosphere among the young players was also a mess.

I was worried that we might really lose badly.

I felt like the performance was better when we were full of arrogance the other day.

I arrived at the locker room and texted Monica.

I told her that today's atmosphere was unusual.

That even the prankster and the whole team were a mess because of the burden.

Then Monica replied.

She told me to lightly smack their butts.

Hmm, that might not be a bad solution.

So, I slapped Santiago's butt.

"Argh!"

The prankster grabbed his butt and collapsed.

He looked at me with a wronged expression.

"If you want to get back at my butt, try scoring more goals than me in today's game."

I'm a real bad guy, aren't I?

Santiago's eyes flared with determination.

Thanks to that, at least the prankster's burden would have disappeared.

Now, my butt is the problem.

I'm sorry, Santiago.

But I'll make sure to score a lot today so you won't have a chance to smack my butt.

Looking at the other players.

It seemed useless to kick their butts.

They were seriously stiff.

But I could kind of understand why the players felt such a burden.

In the last game, the fans were waving banners showing how many games were left for our undefeated championship.

They probably became more conscious after seeing that.

Wow!

As I stepped onto the field, the thought crossed my mind that today's game would be tougher.

The eyes of the Ascoli players were not ordinary.

Of course, if they win today's game, they could immediately rise to second place in the league.

They were going to come at us fiercely.

*Whistle!*

With the referee signaling the start of the game.

My prediction was spot on.

Ascoli began pressing us intensely, as if they had prepared well.

Our defense, already feeling the burden before the game, was flustered by Ascoli's aggressive moves.

And the result?

You could see it on the scoreboard.

[Parma Calcio 0 vs 2 Ascoli]

Just past the 12th minute of the first half.

Parma Calcio had quickly conceded 2 goals to Ascoli and was heavily trailing.

* * *

Compared to the last game, Ascoli's organization seemed much more complete.

It felt strange since it had been a while since we started a game while trailing.

It showed that Ascoli was a good team.

And they seemed to have prepared a lot this time.

Perhaps because of that, the quantity and quality of passes coming my way were poor today.

Even Kenneth was involved in defense, making it hard to show any offensive capabilities.

Veteran Franco, who should be rallying the attack, also seemed out of it.

Conceding 2 goals in 12 minutes of the first half meant that the game was already heavily leaning.

I didn't want to lose to this team, especially remembering getting hit by a water bottle last time.

First, we need to score a goal.

That seems most important.

Fortunately, Santiago was moving well.

It was worth smacking his butt.

I planned to avoid reckless dribbles.

I didn't feel as light as in the Inter match.

Plus, the opponents were marking me intensely.

They had been tugging at my uniform so much that the sturdy ends of it were slightly torn.

Thud!

The ball connected to me.

I shielded the ball with my back against an Ascoli player marking me and passed it to the advancing Kenneth.

Crash!

Despite a messy first touch.

Our Kenneth managed to dribble past a player stubbornly.

Honestly, I thought it would be tough.

But perhaps because of his young age, he seemed to be growing bit by bit.

As Kenneth dribbled forward.

Space opened up for me too.

Kenneth lightly shrugged off the pressure and made a long pass to the side.

But the pass was a bit long.

Santiago barely managed to catch it.

"Damn!"

Santiago extended his leg and managed to catch the ball.

He's been doing yoga lately.

It seems to be paying off.

The prankster, who barely caught the ball, turned his head to find my position.

"Minho!"

Thud!

I received the pass from Santiago.

Then I passed it to Franco.

"Block him!"

Ascoli's defenders moved busily.

I made a move behind them.

Franco matched my move and passed the ball.

As soon as I caught the ball, I feinted a shot with my upper body to get past one player.

To be precise, I pretended to shoot.

"Gasp!"

The defender, who had thrown his body to block my shot, slid with a horrified expression.

I lightly flicked the ball.

Towards Kenneth, who was cutting in.

The opponents had blocked my shooting position.

Now Kenneth had to score.

Even though his shooting accuracy was not perfect.

He wasn't the type to miss such opportunities.

Smack!

Wow!

The cheers from home fans finally erupted.

Kenneth, who scored the goal, gave me a high-five with a calm expression and returned to his position.

- Finally, a goal to start the comeback!

- Minho's assist and Kenneth's goal! Parma, which had been overwhelmed by Ascoli, finally starts a counterattack!

Although we finally got a comeback goal.

Honestly, it was still a long way to go.

Moreover, despite scoring a goal, our defense still seemed disoriented.

It looked like we were catching up to 2-2 with a cross from Dennis Man and a tying goal from Gennaro Tatis.

But just before the end of the first half, we conceded 2 more goals.

- Ascoli is on fire!

- Lucas Spalek! It's a hat-trick! He scores a hat-trick!

- The score is now 4-2, with Ascoli leading by 2 goals again!

The referee's whistle blew.

The players entered the locker room.

Especially the defenders looked completely pale.

Sensing the bad atmosphere, our coach tried his best to rally the players.

But I had a feeling that his speech didn't really reach the players' ears.

At this rate, we might really lose.

* * *

The second half began.

With a score of 4-2, Ascoli players, now even more confident, pressed harder than before.

One positive aspect compared to the first half was.

At least the forwards seemed to have shaken off the burden and regained their composure.

Although the opponent was overwhelming us.

It was encouraging that our forwards were also sharply targeting the gaps created by their high defensive line.

Of course, I had yet to make a proper shot due to the intense marking...

But the other players were different.

As I was being marked.

Space opened up for them.

- Gooooal!

- Kenneth scores a brace!

- The score is now 4-3, with Parma catching up again!

- Today's game! No one could have expected so many goals!

The score was now 4-3.

Parma Calcio's home fans sang support songs with desperate voices, wanting an equalizer.

The away Ascoli fans prayed that they could keep this score.

- Oh no! It's an own goal by Stanko!

- Ah! Parma! Nothing is going right today! Trying to deal with the opponent's sharp cross resulted in an own goal!

Not even Giovanni could have stopped that trajectory.

Stanko covered his face and sat down.

It felt like our defense was being relentlessly dismantled by Ascoli's attack, as if possessed by a ghost.

The score became 5-3 again.

Then Dennis Man scored again.

The score became 5-4.

This seesaw game continued with Ascoli scoring again to make it a bizarre 6-4.

If my dad watched today's game, he might ask if we were playing baseball instead of football.

It felt like neither team's defense was in their right mind.

Our side was burdened and playing much worse than usual.

The opponent's high defensive line and fullbacks constantly joining the attack drained a lot of their energy, reducing their performance.

Thanks to that, it became a goal fest.

Why haven't I scored a single goal?

It's all because of Ascoli's midfielder, who has been shadowing me throughout the game.

It's really annoying.

Now, in the 31st minute of the second half, the ball reached me.

The opponent, noticing that I wasn't making any dribbles, marked me more loosely than before.

How insolent.

Time to teach them a lesson.

- Minho! Creating a chance with a rare dribble in today's game!

- Fast! Ascoli players quickly surround Minho!

Strong pressure comes in.

But unlike before, there are many gaps.

It meant that their stamina and concentration were waning.

On the other hand, I still had plenty of energy and techniques to shake them off.

Thump!

I made a long pass to the center.

Then I turned to the side and cut in.

Moving from the side to the center, I received the ball back from Santiago.

Why did I move to the side?

Because the fullbacks on the side, who were physically and technically inferior, were easier to deal with.

Tap! Tap!

It was a pattern I hadn’t shown in a while.

Dribbling the ball, I cut into the half-space.

Finally, Ascoli's defense panicked.

They had given away this position too easily.

Boom!

Smack!

- Gooooal!

- Minho's fantastic right-footed curling shot! Minhooo!

- The score is now 6-5! Just one more goal, and Parma Calcio can avoid defeat!

- With little time left, Minho reignites the chase!

The Ascoli coach, who had been watching the game comfortably, stood up and pointed at me.

He shouted something.

Probably telling his players to stop my dribble even if it means committing a foul.

But what can he do?

I'm a guy who holds grudges.

My head still hurts from the water bottle incident in the last away game.

So, I'm planning to score one more.

An opportunity will surely come soon.

And.

Just as I thought.

A little past the 45th minute of the second half.

When the referee added 3 minutes of extra time.

I got another chance.

Ascoli's penalty area was crowded with players.

Of course, because there were only about 3 minutes left.

If they could defend just one goal, they would win and move up to second place in the league.

So they focused intensely on defense.

Thanks to that, it was hard to find space.

In such a situation, the ball connected to Kenneth.

Kenneth, who received a high cross.

He turned with the ball.

Despite two defenders charging at him.

They couldn't take the ball away from Kenneth.

Kenneth, firmly guarding the ball, quickly scanned the players' positions.

Then he met my eyes.

Yeah, there's no one else to handle it but me.

As soon as I squeezed past the defenders, Kenneth's pass rolled perfectly to me.

"Heya!"

Making a strange sound, I awkwardly took a shot.

Honestly, I didn't have high expectations for Kenneth's pass, so I was quite tense.

But the pass was so cleanly delivered that my shot trajectory swerved oddly.

Smack!

As soon as the ball hit the net, the home fans erupted in thunderous cheers.

It wasn't a stylish shot.

Well, what can you do about it?

I scored a fantastic goal to make it 6-6.

Yeah, style isn't that important.

I quickly ran to the away section.

Didn't I say?

I hold grudges.

Sliiiide!

I slid on my belly as if I was falling.

I didn't mind the grass stains on my belly.

Then I stood up and put my index finger to my lips, facing the Ascoli away fans.

"Shh!"

The reaction was intense.

Both in the last away game.

And in this home game.

The best gift I could give to Ascoli fans who kept throwing trash at us and cursing us.

Wasn't it too much of a reaction?

You bastard! I'll kill you!

Boooo! You bastard!

Get lost! You damn yellow monkey!

Just come to Ascoli!

The police quickly came out and blocked the Ascoli fans, forming a wall.

I smiled slyly.

Really annoyingly.

Thanks to that, the Ascoli away fans got more aggressive, throwing all kinds of things.

This time, I quickly dodged them all.

I turned my back on them and returned to my place.

Santiago came up and asked.

"Minho! Are you okay? The Ascoli guys looked like they wanted to kill you!"

I answered with a benevolent smile.

"Yeah, we won't meet them again this season."

They're guys I won't see again.

Why should I be scared?

If they're upset, they should try getting promoted with us.
