## Winter Transfer Market (4)

The Manager of Southampton Garma Gerdfolf watched the video of Jules Kaembe, who had been sold for 12 million euros, with a look of disbelief. No matter how much he watched, there was no immediate potential for improvement. He couldn't understand why Arsenal had spent such a hefty sum of 12 million euros to acquire him.

Rumor had it that Arsenal was thinking of converting Jules Kaembe into a winger, but that was a move even the German macho Garma Gerdfolf hadn't considered.

"He was too much of a stretch to use as a winger."

Whether as a wing-back or a winger, he was a player whose potential would explode someday. However, for Southampton, who needed a backup goalkeeper and a central midfielder immediately, Jules Kaembe, an ambiguous wing-back, was nothing but a burden. 

So they sold him this winter.

With the 12 million euros and the transfer fee they had, they strengthened their lacking squad by acquiring goalkeeper Karata Vayndir and central midfielder Matthew Graines.

"Rather, Arsenal has weakened."

Pedro Ocampos, who had homesickness and disrupted some team dynamics, was still a fairly important player among Arsenal's attacking resources. Sending Pedro to Juventus without proper reinforcement meant that the current Arsenal was definitely weaker than in the first half of the season.

Garma Gerdfolf's goal was to win the second leg and advance to the League Cup final, believing that he could overturn the 2-0 scoreline. 

And on the match day.

Garma Gerdfolf saw Jules Kaembe's name on the starting lineup for the League Cup semi-final second leg and was convinced that the odds of a comeback had significantly increased.

"This time, Alain Levagne made a mistake."

Even though the League Cup semi-final second leg wasn't very important for Arsenal, Jules Kaembe, who was still adapting to the team, was put in a position to aim for the championship.

If it were him, he would have fielded the main squad and advanced to the League Cup final.

"Serie A and EPL are different. I'll beat Arsenal and lead Southampton to win the League Cup."

He was confident.

He had prepared a lot.

He knew better than anyone how to defend against Jules Kaembe.

The two teams' players finally entered the field.

Garma Gerdfolf, who stepped into the technical area, looked at the opposing attack line.

"There are more main players than I thought. But it's not impossible to win."

His gaze fell on Jules Kaembe, who looked around Southampton's home ground, St. Mary's Stadium, with a tense expression.

"I don't have to worry about the left side today."

It was clear that Jules Kaembe wouldn't be very threatening on Arsenal's right flank.

He was convinced and watched the game.

The match started with the referee's whistle.

Southampton had also thickened the depth of their backup players by acquiring Matthew Graines and Karata Vayndir.

Garma Gerdfolf watched Matthew Graines making his Southampton debut with a satisfied expression, nodding his head.

But his satisfied expression began to crack two minutes into the game.

Jules Kaembe, whom he had ignored, showed a sharp appearance on Arsenal's right flank.

"What?"

He wasn't originally this kind of player.

Why did he suddenly come out as a winger and show a powerful breakthrough followed by a shot?

It was a powerful shot that even shook the heart of the tough Garma Gerdfolf.

If it weren't for Southampton's main goalkeeper, Pedro Costa, who threw himself, it would have been a goal.

"A shot?"

It was a sight he had never seen before.

The Jules Kaembe he knew only showed weak crosses or passes after a reckless breakthrough.

That player was now taking shots.

It was a shocking scene.

A player who had never shown such a performance in the EPL was now showing it at Arsenal after leaving Southampton.

The ball flowed to the right again.

Arsenal's offensive did not stop.

Since it was still the beginning of the first half, Garma Gerdfolf thought that if they held on, a chance would surely come.

Until Minho Park easily picked up the second ball after the goalkeeper blocked Jules Kaembe's shot.

* * *

I scored the first goal in the fourth minute of the first half.

Jules Kaembe's bold shot was punched out by the opposing goalkeeper and flowed in front of me, so I just lightly pushed the ball into the net.

It was the most uneventful goal of my soccer career.

It was that easy of a goal.

"Minhooooooo! Arsenal's surprise gooooal in the fourth minute of the first half!"

"Jules Kaembe, who transferred from Southampton to Arsenal, produces a meaningful result in his first match as a wing forward in the fifth minute of the first half!"

"Unfortunately, there's no assist since it was a second ball, but the player who contributed the most to this goal is definitely Jules Kaembe!"

Honestly, I didn't have high expectations for Jules Kaembe today.

Except for that thunderous shot, Kaembe was still a mess, so I figured he would be tightly marked by Southampton's defense after the first half.

But even that much time bought us enough.

"Ah... It's been a while since I've been in a free position."

Southampton's defense was more concerned with marking Kaembe rather than me, startled by his shot.

Thanks to that, I could move a bit more freely today, which meant a chance was coming to me soon.

"Minho!"

Lorenzo Lupo received a long ball with his chest and protected it from the defender with his back.

Seeing me turning to move forward, Lorenzo passed the ball to me, and I pushed on, seeing Southampton's defender, Mohamed Malah, hastily blocking my way.

But it was already too late.

He should have moved earlier if he wanted to stop me.

"Minho! A fantastic step-over!"

"Minho easily bypasses one player! Running forward, Minho! Minho! Shooooot! Gooooooal!"

"A multi-goal within 15 minutes of the first half by Minhooooo!"

"Fantastic! Crazy!"

As I scored two goals in no time, the home fans of Southampton at St. Mary's Stadium booed and criticized the players for their poor performance.

"What are you doing?"

"You should have stopped that!"

"Boooooo!"

Of course, Southampton didn't just take it lying down.

Angel Carvalho, responsible for Southampton's midfield, had a wide vision and excellent passing ability.

Now nearing thirty years old, he had also gained experience, making him the heart of the current Southampton team.

Bang!

Despite Arsenal's pressure, he calmly aimed at Arsenal's flank with a long pass.

The home fans, who had been quiet, erupted in cheers at the sight of the ball crossing the field.

Waaaaaah!

Simultaneously, Southampton's attack began.

Receiving Angel Carvalho's pass, Lee Adams quickly ran and made an accurate pass to Charlie Armstrong at the front.

The target was the space ahead of Charlie Armstrong, moving behind Craig Martin.

As soon as he got the ball, he used his speed to break through Arsenal's defense in an instant.

Finally, a chance came for Southampton.

And that wasn't the end.

Western Daniels, the winger on the opposite side, also penetrated through Arsenal's confused defense.

Western Daniels, receiving a short and concise pass from Charlie Armstrong, found the area around him empty.

Only then did Magalhães realize his mistake with a regretful expression.

It was a situation where a goal was almost inevitable.

Southampton didn't miss this chance.

"Gooooooal! Southampton finally scores at St. Mary's Stadium!"

"The score is now 2-1, with Southampton quickly catching up by one goal!"

"A clean counterattack, right?"

"Yes, it was. Arsenal's defense had no choice but to give up space momentarily due to the clean combination play."

This was unavoidable.

The opponent had made a properly executed goal.

Marlon Ramsdale, with an angry expression, scolded Craig for losing the mark on Western Daniels.

"You should have watched Western!"

Then came the encouragement.

Ramsdale seemed well aware that only half of the first half had passed.

"Let's focus a bit more! As long as we don't lose by a large margin, we will be the ones moving to the final! Keep your mentality and defend fiercely!"

Arsenal's defenders nodded at his words.

Indeed, Southampton was not an easy team.

But it didn't seem like we would lose.

Why, you ask?

Because I felt like I would score a hat trick today.

Yes, my form was sharp today.

That was my basis and reason.

* * *

Jules Kaembe watched Minho Park lightly push in the second ball from his shot and thought that Jules Kaembe had more potential than he had imagined.

At the same time, he realized that the time spent practicing in the training ground had not been in vain.

He also felt a small desire.

A desire to perform even better than now.

And a few days ago, a scene from the training ground came to Jules Kaembe's mind.

The play of Minho Park, who had stayed close to him in practice and taught him various things, suddenly came to mind.

"Back then... Minho moved like this, right?"

He would probably fail.

No, the probability of failure was high.

He wasn't a technically skilled player.

But Jules Kaembe wanted to take on the challenge.

He wanted to recreate the fantastic breakthrough that Minho Park had shown in practice during the match, using his own rough skills.

And just before the end of the first half, a rare opportunity came to Jules Kaembe.

"The ball connects to Jules Kaembe!"

"Kaembe, who has shown several powerful breakthroughs and shots today!"

"It was simple but... really destructive breakthroughs, right?"

"Yes, it was."

Slowly dribbling the ball forward, Jules Kaembe saw Southampton's left full-back, Jade Borkins, swallow nervously and stand in his way.

"Hoo..."

Taking a deep breath, Jules Kaembe saw a slight lapse in Jade Borkins' concentration, kicked the ball forward, and ran.

Despite the simplicity of the breakthrough, Jade Borkins, with a desperate expression, struggled to keep up with Jules Kaembe.

But it wasn't just Jade Borkins who was wary of Jules Kaembe.

Western Daniels, who had scored for Southampton today, also quickly joined the defense to block his path.

"Western Daniels! Pressing!"

"Jules Kaembe trapped by two players!"

In a normal situation, or for the usual Jules Kaembe, he would often lose the ball here.

But today, Jules Kaembe moved his feet quickly, surprising the two Southampton players pressing him.

Of course, they weren't the only ones surprised.

The commentators also raised their voices at Jules Kaembe's fantastic play.

"Jules Kaembe's scoop turn! Was this player always so skilled? Amazing!"

"Jules Kaembe escaping in an instant! Now the crosssss!"

"Minho! Minho in the center receives the ball with his chest! Flicks it up with his foot and a volley shoooot!"

"Goal! An amazing goal just before the end of the first half!"

"Wow! Arsenal! Minho! Jules Kaembe! Arsenal is more powerful than usual today!"

"And looking back, Jules Kaembe performed a scoop turn to escape two players... and then connected a rabona cross! Minho received it with his chest, flicked it up with his right foot, and then turned to volley it!"

"This is definitely a candidate for the Puskás Award this year! Incredible! Minho! Incredible! Truly incredible!"

Jules Kaembe, who recorded his first career assist, smiled brightly with joy.

Minho Park, who ran over and lightly hugged him, waved to the Gunners who followed them to the away match with a smile.

The protagonist of the three goals in the first half was Minho Park.

He scored a hat trick in the blink of an eye.

But Minho Park instead brought Jules Kaembe to the fans and shouted while pointing at him.

"This guy made the goal! Everyone got that? This amazing player created this fantastic goal!"

Hearing those words, Kaembe looked at Minho Park with a touched expression for a moment, then greeted the Gunners, enjoying his first career attacking point.
