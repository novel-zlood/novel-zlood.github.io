## 17. Professor Park Minho!(2)

A goal scored in an instant.

Regina's coach, Domenico, grabbed his head and sighed deeply.

An Asian player debuting at the age of 24.

Though it's a late age, watching him have a more brilliant debut season than anyone else made Coach Domenico ponder.

Is there a chance for a comeback here?

Honestly, he judged it to be very low.

He had planned to maintain a 0-0 score until midway through the second half.

But they conceded a goal in an instant.

A 1-0 score was not expected.

However, as a coach, his position is not to merely sit on the bench and watch the scene.

He got up and quickly started thinking.

How should he solve this?

How should he recover the score from here?

Even Parma is not a perfect team.

With all the starting central midfielders out, Regina could definitely find opportunities by penetrating through the center.

But to do that, many sacrifices would have to be made.

Especially, the defensive line protected by the central midfielders would be exposed to Parma's attackers.

Should they take the risk and go on the offensive?

Coach Domenico's worries deepened.

But.

That worry had to end quickly.

Clang!

A header goal by Keneth in the 14th minute of the first half.

The attack that started from Park Minho's feet passed through Gennaro Tatis' feet and reached Keneth Marsechico's head.

It resulted in Parma's second goal.

Seeing this, Coach Domenico had no choice but to use an extreme method.

Anyway, it was clear that they would lose if they stayed still.

Shouldn't Regina at least launch one counterattack?

“We refuse to be treated like punching bags.”

He shouted loudly to his players.

To attack through the center.

Even if the defense is disorganized, penetrate the center more and score goals.

Even though he shouted that, Coach Domenico's expression was not good.

Because this time, Gennaro Tatis' fantastic half-volley shot went in.

A score that widened in an instant.

A little over 20 minutes into the first half.

The score was now 3-0.

* * *

Regina completely collapsed.

From the moment the score gap of 3-0 started, Regina rushed in without looking back.

It was actually more annoying and harder to break through when they were firmly crouched.

From the moment they targeted our center, Parma's three forwards gained more freedom.

-Regina! They are being hit mercilessly!

-There was no miracle for Regina from the moment Parma scored the first goal!

-The ball heading towards Mino!

-Minoooooo! He takes the ball and shoots it directly!

-Gooooooal!

Thanks to that, I scored multiple goals early in the game.

Debuting at a late age was worrisome.

But it was a relief to score goals like this.

Due to my lack of experience, I was worried in the middle of the game.

Would I break down mentally someday?

Fortunately, that never happened.

The reason was undoubtedly thanks to the fans of Parma Calcio who cheered loudly for me.

“Minooooooo!”

“Waaaaah! You’re the best! The best! The sexiest Asian in Parma is you!”

“Parma! Minooooo!”

How could my mental state collapse when hearing such cheers?

It's an impossible thing.

The fans love me like that.

I can never break down.

So I try harder and train a lot.

So much so that the coach begs me to go home, saying my rabbit-like daughter and fox-like wife are waiting.

When I heard that.

Honestly, I felt sorry for Monica too.

I felt like I couldn't take care of Monica, who came to Parma after a long time, because I was focusing on training.

But Monica understood me.

She knew it was the most important time for me and said she would always wait.

But what does she mean by waiting?

It gives me a weird chill down my spine.

Was it our 100th day?

Or some other special event?

Does Italy celebrate White Day?

“Mino! Let's go!”

As my random thoughts ended, my teammates called me.

I’ll ask Giovanni later.

After finishing the celebration and returning to my position, Bentzini looked frustrated.

“Do you hate the SNS ban that much?”

“It's my lifeline.”

“……”

That Bentzini guy.

He seems to have a serious SNS addiction.

No, that's really bad for your mental health.

I let it go.

“Alright, if you score one goal today, I’ll lift the SNS ban.”

“Really?”

“Of course.”

Bentzini's eyes sparkled.

He really intends to score a goal.

But what can he do?

Judging by today's game results.

It seems Santiago won't have any chance.

* * *

Keneth thought.

Lately, he felt that Park Minho's play had changed a lot from before.

Keneth, who used to watch Park Minho on TV or from the stands, captured the changes in his movements.

‘So that's how he does it here.’

In the game, he learns from Park Minho.

Like a professor, Park Minho teaches Keneth a lot directly through his play.

Tap! Tap!

-Mino! With a sudden change of direction, he evades Regina's defender and crosses immediately!

-Waiting in the middle is the 2-meter giant, Keneth Marsechico!

“Hup!”

He jumped high and headed the ball directly.

The opposing goalkeeper couldn't stop the high trajectory header he struck down and fell.

The ball naturally crossed the goal line.

The 5th goal scored at the end of the first half.

Regina had lost its will now.

The score gap was too big to expect a miracle.

Soon, the referee blew the whistle.

The first half was over.

Keneth briefly glanced at the opposing team's coach rushing into the locker room, then turned his head to look at Park Minho.

‘I’m really learning a lot today too.’

Keneth clenched his fists while looking at Park Minho, who was like his idol.

He thought of putting in a lot of effort to become such a great striker someday.

Entering the locker room, Coach Alain was beaming as he praised the players who made the score 5-0.

At the same time, he left a message saying that soccer is a sport where you never know when a miracle will happen, so don't let your guard down until the end.

That was all.

Honestly, talking more to players who were winning 5-0 would just be nagging.

Coach Alain knew that too.

Keneth quietly put a banana in his mouth while thinking about how to move in the second half.

“Ah! Mino! You’re done for today.”

“Is that so?”

Well, it's a game that's almost decided with a 5-0 score.

Even if Park Minho is out, it won't be a big problem for the game.

Even if Gianluca is substituted in, Parma will still show overwhelming performance against Regina in the second half.

But Keneth felt regretful.

The opportunity to learn by watching each movement closely was gone.

That was a bit disappointing.

Soon, the second half started after halftime.

Gianluca certainly showed the dignity of a veteran.

The pass he connected in the 11th minute of the second half linked cleanly to Keneth's foot, resulting in the team's 6th goal.

But Keneth was not satisfied.

He certainly knew that Gianluca was an excellent linking forward.

But he wasn't as good as Park Minho.

‘The difference in passing was huge.’

The timing was subtly different.

Moreover, the position where the pass reached was also different.

Gianluca felt a bit more rough.

Conversely, Park Minho was quite comfortable.

Soon, Coach Alain Levagne pulled out the second substitution card and called Keneth to the bench.

Keneth!

The giant of Parma!

You were awesome today too!

With enthusiastic cheers supporting him, Keneth silently induced applause as he slowly headed to the bench.

“You worked hard.”

Keneth nodded vigorously at Park Minho's words, who was already sitting on the bench.

* * *

[Parma! Secures Serie B title with 9 games left in the league! Now aiming for an undefeated championship!]

[Coach Alain Levagne: ‘It's been a fantastic season. But we can't let our guard down yet. We have to aim for bigger goals.’]

[Keneth, selected as the MVP of the Regina match! ‘Mino is a professor! I learn a lot on the field.’]

Thanks to Keneth's bizarre interview, I earned the nickname "Professor."

I wondered if I was that strict like a professor.

Keneth, with an innocent look, told me.

He said he learns a lot on the field.

But I haven’t taught him anything.

What does he mean by that?

I couldn't understand.

Anyway.

After securing the championship.

We really advanced unimpeded.

We won the next match against Pisa 3-1.

Pisa's key striker, Lorenzo Lupo, asked me, ‘Which league are you going to?’

Why is that your concern?

Even Monica doesn't ask me that these days, but a 2-meter-tall guy asking me something like that gave me the chills.

He asked for my uniform after the match, so I quickly handed it over and ran.

Honestly, it's a bit scary.

After winning 3-1 against Pisa, we won the next match against Alessandria 8-0.

Not Alexandria.

It’s Alessandria.

Even I get confused about this.

In the match against Alessandria, I recorded 41 goals and 30 assists for the season.

Once again, the media in Parma made a fuss.

[Mino scores over 70 attack points in a season! Where will the sun of Parma head next?]

[Still struggling with the renewal! What does Mino want?]

[Parma's regret! Ah! A buyout of 20 million euros? Foolish Parma! Oh! Parma!]

The more I perform.

The more Parma begs for a contract renewal, now almost lying flat.

Honestly, since we got promoted.

If we win the Italian Cup and secure a Europa League spot, I was thinking of renewing the contract.

But.

Isn't that honestly not an easy thing?

We still have the second leg with Atalanta.

Even if we make it to the final, we have to face either AC Milan or Lazio, so we can't let our guard down.

I decided to put the contract talk on hold.

Now it seemed like the time to focus on the March international break.

“Take care and come back safely!”

“Yeah, I’ll be careful and come back safely.”

Receiving Monica’s send-off, I left the house.

Living together with Monica these days made me feel a sense of stability.

It felt more peaceful.

There’s something like that.

While lost in thought for a moment, the car carrying me quickly arrived at the airport, and with the help of an agency staff sent by Leo, I quickly took my luggage and headed to Germany.

Why to Germany, you ask?

There was a reason.

Senior Shin Junseo would also be heading to Germany.

Our national team opponent was Germany.

[The Korean national football team will play a friendly match against the 'Panzer Corps' Germany during the March international break!]

[Germany, the opponent for the Taegeuk Warriors facing Turkmenistan!]

[Coach Pedro: ‘There’s a lot of worry about player selection. Especially since South Korea has such a good attacking lineup.’]

[Coach Pedro's happy dilemma! Will the trio of Shin Junseo, Hwang Yoohyun, and Park Minho be activated?]

Korean football fans are already excited.

They’re anticipating how well we’ll perform against Germany.

Maybe because it's been a long time since we last met them after winning 2-0 in the 2018 Russia World Cup.

They say the opponent has also assembled a squad close to their first team.

It makes me strangely excited and nervous.

The chances of losing are high.

But it seems fun and I am looking forward to it.

Before boarding the plane.

Coach Pedro contacted me.

He asked me to play in the second line for this match.

Our Coach Pedro.

It seems he wants to use me in the central second line this time.

Lately, I’ve been watching a lot of analysis videos of a player who used to play very well in the second line.

Well, now he’s playing in the third line.

But there’s so much to learn from him.

His ability to use both feet, and his strong and low ground ball crosses and shots were impressive.

Inspired by that, I had been practicing ground ball crosses excitedly at the training ground a few days ago.

Bentzini shook his head watching me.

He said he was all about Marseille turns.

And you’re into ground ball crosses.

But Bentzini was overusing Marseille turns anytime, anywhere.

I, on the other hand, can throw a strong, low ground ball cross when appropriate.

What? That’s double standards?

Ahem! Ahem...

Anyway, Bentzini and I are different.

Everything is just different.
