## 9. Never Underestimate South Korea Again! (3)

I had decided to showcase senior Shin Junseo's 80-meter dribble.

To be honest, I thought it would be extremely difficult to replicate unless a good opportunity presented itself.

The reason being that his 80-meter dribble was an extraordinary play that won the Puskás Award.

As Lecce tied the score to 2-2, the atmosphere changed drastically.

It was too disappointing to just sit back.

The opponent had one player sent off.

In the first half, they were leading 2-0, but suddenly it was tied 2-2.

They couldn't just sit back and defend the line.

Lecce pushed their line forward.

At the same time, I was looking for an opportunity.

If I had the chance to sprint at full speed...

I was genuinely thinking of replicating that incredible run.

But it wasn't easy.

"Push the line! Slowly! Slowly!"

Lecce, having pushed their line forward, was fierce.

It was tough for us, who were one man down, to defend.

However, our defensive line wasn't completely messed up.

Unlike in the first half, Parma's defense was forming a tighter line than expected.

The team's atmosphere was strangely better than in the first half.

It might be because the score, which had been 2-0, was now 2-2.

But more than that, it seemed we had finally adapted to playing with 10 men.

In fact, the team coordination was better with 10 men than with 11.

Of course, playing with 10 men consumed more energy.

But because of that, our concentration was heightened.

Hmm... rather than saying our concentration was heightened...

Maybe it's better to say that running around so frantically left no room for idle thoughts?

Anyway.

As the game dragged on, Lecce's players started committing more frequent fouls.

Already their fourth yellow card.

Three of those cards were on Lecce's defenders.

"This is an opportunity."

Yes, it's an opportunity.

A little past the 30th minute of the second half.

I believed that if we waited a bit longer, we would definitely get a chance to counterattack.

So I conserved my energy.

And as if reading my mind, Valentin Mihaila was substituted on the opposite wing.

With fresh energy, Valentin Mihaila drew all of Lecce's attention in the remaining time.

- The ball to Valentin!

- He's fast! Valentin Mihaila, with full energy, swiftly breaks through the opponent's side!

Valentin Mihaila, running like a red hare, drew at least two defenders before crossing, forcing the opponent to run again to block Gennaro Tatis's header.

Continuously depleting energy.

The players of both Lecce and Parma were getting exhausted.

Amidst this, I was gradually being forgotten.

“You f***ing bastard, running around like a mad foal.”

Antonio, Lecce's left fullback, who had covered for Valentin and Gennaro’s counterattacks multiple times, came back to my side and grumbled.

Now, to this guy’s eyes, I was invisible.

Even during counterattacks, I seemed exhausted.

I was just jogging around.

Even if the ball came to me.

I would just pass it long to the opposite side.

I didn't move at all.

To Lecce’s defense, I was just a scarecrow, completely drained and only distributing passes.

It felt like an opportunity was coming.

It was now the 35th minute of the second half.

There were still 10 minutes left.

Generously speaking, there were about 15 minutes left.

The coach took out the third substitution card.

He took out Marjan, who had been running crazily in the center, and sent in Simon Sophie, strengthening the defense.

To anyone watching, it would look like we were settling for a 2-2 draw.

But I knew.

This was a trick by coach Alain Lavan.

Well, I didn't know the details, but...

This substitution would confuse Lecce.

Their strategy from the first half, which worked so well, was starting to get blocked by the opponent as time went on.

And in such a situation, the opponent starts to settle.

Could they run as fast as before, having spent so much energy after the score turned 2-2?

No.

I was sure.

You can learn this flow even in amateur football.

The same goes for other sports.

Even in online games.

When things that were going well start getting blocked and the flow gets disrupted.

The idle thoughts start to dominate the brain.

They think.

It's tiring.

Yes, what starts to dominate their brains, having spent so much energy, is not adrenaline but accumulated fatigue.

Yes, their bodies and minds become dominated by fatigue.

No, domination isn't the right word.

Engulfed might be a better fit.

It would feel like being stuck in a swamp.

When such a moment comes.

Can this friend Antonio, who is frowning in front of me, overcome the monster called fatigue and stop my run?

I'm a bit curious.

And soon, the opportunity to answer that curiosity came.

Yes, right now.

“Minho!”

A little past the 45th minute of the second half.

Three minutes of added time.

Not 80 meters.

Not even close to 70 meters.

The opponent’s tired defenders.

And I had just enough energy left for one perfect sprint.

* * *

It started with a light left-foot touch.

Antonio in front of me glanced at me.

He probably thought I would pass and play it out.

So he did not close in.

Yes, he was complacent.

Too complacent.

Thud!

I attempted a breakthrough by pushing the ball with my right foot.

Antonio in front of me was momentarily surprised and threw his body to block my breakthrough.

But with enough space, I kicked the ball far forward and started to speed up.

Gradually picking up speed.

I only felt Antonio's fingers brush against my uniform for a moment.

I quickly broke through between two Lecce midfielders trying to surround me, kicking the ball far forward again.

And I pushed through that space.

This time, a rough tackle came in from the side.

It seemed impossible to run straight for 80 meters like senior Shin Junseo.

I didn't have that kind of running power.

So I turned my body.

- Minho! Minho! Avoids Alexis Tablin’s tackle with a fantastic Marseille turn and returns to the side!

- He’s fast! Minho, who slowed down with the Marseille turn, faces Morten Holmant ahead!

By doing a Marseille turn to avoid the opponent, Lecce’s players had some time to block my way.

I had also slowed down a bit.

But I didn't stop.

The opponent's arm touched my body.

But I pushed him away with my arm and kept running.

And with strength, I pushed him away.

Even though the opponent was a bit bulkier than me, he was too exhausted physically, so it wasn't a problem.

The opponent slipped and fell.

I ran past him.

Now, only three players were in front of me.

I sped up even more.

- Minho! Minho! Minho!

- Whoa! Avoids one more! He’s fast!

- He’s covered nearly 50 meters!

After avoiding one more, the opponent acknowledged me and tried to take my timing with a sliding tackle.

It meant they didn’t care if they got a card.

But my instincts told me.

I could avoid this.

Thud!

Lightly lifting the ball.

At the same time, jumping over the opponent's sliding tackle, I kicked the ball short and broke into the danger zone.

Anyone watching would have thought I jumped with the ball.

- Minho! Minho! Minho!

- He’s close! He’s close! Only two players left in front!

Now, only two players were in front of me.

One defender and the goalkeeper.

As I got closer to the goal.

The remaining defender charged at me.

Pretending to shoot, then pulling back, the last remaining defender lost his balance and fell.

But even while losing his balance, he touched my foot with his hand, interfering with my shot.

This would definitely be a penalty kick.

But wouldn't it be better if I scored?

Well, if I miss, they’ll give the penalty kick.

The ball rose at an awkward angle.

And I lost my balance too.

But I saw a perfect shooting angle.

I hurriedly swung my free right foot.

Bang!

The ball, which hit slightly lower, was surely going to rise.

And the ball, which rose high, went over the goalkeeper and hit the top of the goal post, then fell down.

Ding!

Quickly turning around, the goalkeeper stretched out his hand.

Although not certain, the ball, which fell just in front of his hand, slowly bounced and crossed the goal line slightly.

A defender ran and kicked the ball away.

But I was sure.

The ball had completely crossed the line.

The referee hesitated for a moment, then communicated with the VAR assistant and made a gesture.

Yes, the gesture shown when a goal is recognized.

Seeing that, I quickly ran toward the away fans' section.

"Whoa! You f***er!"

"Insane! Insane, Minhoooooooo!"

"He ran almost 70 meters! 70 meters!"

My teammates closely following behind me.

But this time, I had no intention of being the bottom bun in the celebratory pile.

I did a knee slide in front of the three Koreans waving the Korean flag at me.

And with my left hand, I pounded my heart and the emblem.

With my right index finger, I pointed at the Korean flag.

Are you watching, Parma?

Are you watching, South Korea?

And.

“Boo louder, Lecce!”

* * *

Kim Minshik.

Park Changgyu.

Lee Juseong.

These three were YouTubers who loved soccer.

They traveled the world, visiting soccer stadiums, capturing the atmosphere, and sharing stories, becoming famous as travel YouTubers.

This time, they visited Parma, Italy.

Upon hearing about the match against Lecce a few days later, they managed to get tickets for the away game and headed to Lecce.

When they first arrived.

They were worried about the hostile stares they felt, but luckily, nothing major happened until they reached the stadium.

On the day of the match.

They headed to the stadium to shoot their YouTube video.

“Wow... It feels like we’re watching a derby.”

“Considering the incidents a few days ago, it’s not surprising.”

“Do you think we’ll make it out safely?”

“We probably won’t die. But we might have to brace ourselves for a punch or two.”

Fortunately, the Parma Ultras who had followed them displayed goodwill, seeing them with the Korean flag.

Conversely, the Lecce fans on the other side of the fence hurled all sorts of abuse at them for holding up the Korean flag.

“This is really intense.”

“Well, given the various issues recently.”

“Do you think Park Minho will play well?”

“I don’t know, but I hope he does.”

And the match began.

Lecce dominated the early stages.

No, Lecce had taken complete control.

“Oh no! He got sent off.”

One of the central defenders was sent off.

Unable to overcome the numerical disadvantage, they conceded two goals.

As a result, the Parma away section was downcast, while the nearby Lecce home fans mocked the dejected Parma fans.

But.

When the second half started.

Whatever they had heard during halftime, Parma began their counterattack.

The first goal came, assisted by Park Minho.

Then a header from Gennaro Tatis brought them level at 2-2.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!

The previously despondent Parma away fans now raised their voices with renewed energy.

The three Koreans joined in, loudly cheering for Parma.

And as the atmosphere gradually cooled down.

The match between the two teams seemed to be heading for a draw.

Soon.

The regular time ended.

Only three minutes of added time remained.

And just as the added time began.

Park Minho, the reason they came to the stadium, suddenly started dribbling the ball and sprinting.

One player.

Then another.

With his quick pace, he bypassed the defenders and skillfully avoided a sliding tackle with a Marseille turn, accelerating further.

“Whoa!”

“Minho! Minho! Run!”

“Minhoooooooo!”

The Parma away fans roared like beasts.

Among them, the three Koreans also loudly cheered for Park Minho.

Overcoming the physical battles.

Breaking into the danger zone, Park Minho skillfully dodged a sliding tackle alongside the ball, then penetrated the penalty area’s side.

The last remaining defender fell for his feint and lost balance, interfering with his shot.

Even while falling, Park Minho managed a precise shot, narrowly hitting the top of the goalpost.

The ball, hitting the top post, fell near the goal line.

A defender hurriedly came and cleared the ball.

“Oh! Did that not go in?”

“Ref! Penalty! Penalty!”

When everyone was about to claim a penalty.

The referee, contrary to their expectations, signaled that the goal had been scored.

The scoreboard showed that Park Minho's shot had crossed the goal line, and cheers erupted loudly.

Whoaaaaa!

A buzzer-beater goal with 3 minutes of added time left.

Park Minho, who scored the goal, ran towards them and did a knee slide.

Pounding the emblem with his left hand.

Pointing to the Korean flag with his right hand, the three Koreans felt immense joy and fell into a frenzy.

“Whoaaaaa!”

“Minhooooooo!”

“Whoa! The Korean flag! The Korean flag!”

“South Korea! South Korea! Whoaaaaa!”

“Bartender!”

Soon.

All the added time had passed, and the match ended with a score of 3-2, known as the Pele score.

The winner was Parma.

Lecce's home fans, having suffered a comeback defeat to 10 men, immediately caused a disturbance by lighting flares.

The three hurriedly followed the Parma away fans to exit the stadium, packed their things, and quickly moved to a nearby hotel in Lecce.

Arriving at the hotel, the three, with dazed expressions, sat on the bed and sofa, edited the video they shot today, and fell into a small dilemma.

“What should be the title?”

“Ugh... Something really catchy... Oh? Something like! You’ll die if you miss this?”

While the two were pondering.

The oldest, Lee Juseong, quickly wrote the title and started encoding.

“Hey! Hyung!”

“What are you doing!”

But seeing the title written by Lee Juseong, the two nodded with a peculiar expression.

The thumbnail, showing Park Minho's nearly 70-meter sprint, had bold Korean fonts.

The title was very provocative.

[Title: Never Underestimate South Korea Again!]

The three thought.

This feels good.

It might rake in views.
