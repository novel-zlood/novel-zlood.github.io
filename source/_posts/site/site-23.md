## 9. Never Underestimate South Korea Again! (3)

I was determined to show off Sunbae Shin Jun-seo's 80-meter dribble.

Honestly, I thought it would be very difficult to recreate it if a good opportunity didn't arise.

That's because that 80-meter dribble was such an amazing play that it won the Puskás Award.

The atmosphere of Lecce, who had caught up to 2-2, rapidly changed.

It was too disappointing to just sit back.

Their opponent had one player sent off.

From a situation where they were winning 2-0 in the first half, they were suddenly caught up to 2-2.

They absolutely couldn't just sit back and lower their line.

Lecce pushed their line up.

At the same time, I was looking for an opportunity.

If there was a chance to run at full speed.

I was really planning to recreate that incredible run.

But it wasn't easy.

"Push the line! Slowly! Slowly!"

Sure enough, Lecce, who had pushed their line up, was fierce.

It was tough for us, who were one player short, to block them.

But that didn't mean our line was a mess.

Unlike the first half, our Parma defense was forming a surprisingly tight line.

The team's atmosphere was strangely better than in the first half.

It might be because the score, which had been trailing 2-0, was now 2-2.

But more than that, it seemed more appropriate to say that we had finally properly adapted to the formation of playing with 10 men.

Our coordination was actually better than when we were playing with 11 men.

Of course, because we had only 10 players, we were expending more energy.

But because we were running a lot, our concentration had greatly increased.

Hmm... Rather than saying our concentration had greatly increased,

Maybe it would be better to say that running around frantically had cleared our minds of any distractions?

Anyway.

As the game dragged on, the frequency of rough fouls by Lecce players increased.

Already the fourth yellow card.

Three of those cards were on Lecce's defenders.

"This is a chance."

Yeah, it's a chance.

A little over 30 minutes into the second half.

I believed that if we held out a little longer, a counterattack opportunity would definitely come to us.

I conserved my stamina for that.

And as if reading my mind, Valentin Mihăilă was substituted in on the opposite side of my flank.

The energetic Valentin Mihăilă attracted all of Lecce's attention for the remaining time.

- Ball goes to Valentin!

- He's fast! The fully energized Valentin Mihăilă breaks through the opponent's flank in an instant!

Valentin Mihăilă, who ran like a red horse, drew at least two defenders before crossing, forcing the opponent to run again to block Gennaro Tatis's header.

Continuously expending energy.

The exhausted Lecce and Parma players.

In the midst of that, I was gradually being forgotten.

"Damn bastard. Running around like a crazy colt."

Valentin and Gennaro.

Lecce's left fullback Antonio, who had run to the center multiple times to cover the two's counterattacks, came back to my side and grumbled.

Now, in this guy's eyes, I was invisible.

Even during counterattacks, I was running leisurely as if out of energy.

Even when the ball came to me.

I just connected it long to the other side.

I didn't move at all.

To Lecce's defenders, I would look like a scarecrow completely drained, just distributing passes.

It seemed like an opportunity was coming.

Now it was the 35th minute of the second half.

There was still 10 minutes left.

Generously speaking, there were 15 minutes left.

The coach used the third substitution card.

Replacing the crazily running Marian in the center with Simon Soph to reinforce the defense.

To anyone watching, it might seem like we were now settling for a 2-2 draw.

But I knew.

This was Coach Alain Levagne's trick.

Well, I didn't know the details.

But this substitution would confuse Lecce.

The soccer that had worked so well for them in the first half was starting to be blocked by the opponent as time went on.

And in such a situation, the opponent was settling.

After expending a lot of energy since it became 2-2, if they saw the current situation, could they run as fast as before?

No.

I was sure.

This is a flow you can learn even in amateur soccer.

The same goes for other sports.

Even online games.

When the play that had been going well gets blocked and the flow starts to break.

The moment the distractions that arise from that begin to dominate the brain.

They think.

It's hard.

Yeah, what starts to dominate their brains, which had been pouring out energy, is not adrenaline but accumulated fatigue.

Yeah, their bodies and minds are dominated by fatigue.

No, it's not domination.

The word 'engulfed' might be more fitting.

It would feel like being trapped in a swamp.

If such a moment comes.

Can the friend Antonio, who is frowning in front of me, overcome the monster called fatigue and block my run?

I'm a little curious.

And soon, the opportunity to resolve that curiosity came.

Yeah, right now.

"Mino!"

A little over 45 minutes into the second half.

3 minutes of added time.

It's not even 80 meters.

A distance slightly less than 70 meters.

The opponent's exhausted defenders.

And I had just enough energy left to show a perfect run once.

* * *

It started with a light left-footed touch.

Antonio, who was in front of me, glanced at me.

Maybe he thought I would pass and play it out.

He didn't even close in, thinking that way.

Yeah, it's too complacent.

Way too complacent.

Thud!

I attempted a breakthrough by pushing the ball with my right foot.

Antonio, who was in front of me, was momentarily flustered and tried to block my breakthrough by pushing his body.

But with enough space, I kicked the ball long and started to gain speed.

The speed that started to build up gradually.

I only felt Antonio's fingers brushing against my uniform for a moment.

I kicked the ball long again between the two Lecce midfielders who were quickly surrounding me from the side.

And I broke through that space.

This time a rough tackle came in from the side.

It seemed impossible to run straight for 80 meters like Sunbae Shin Jun-seo.

Because I didn't have that kind of sprinting ability.

So I turned my body.

-Mino! Mino! Avoids Alexis Tablín's tackle with a fantastic Marseille turn and goes back to the flank!

-He's fast! Mino's speed has slowed down after the Marseille turn, and Morten Hjulmand is blocking his way!

After dodging the opponent with a Marseille turn, some Lecce players had enough time to block my way.

I had also slowed down a bit.

But I didn't stop.

The opponent's arm touched my body.

But I pushed him away with my arm and kept running.

And I pushed him away with strength.

Even though the opponent was a bit bulkier than me, it wasn't a problem because he was exhausted.

The opponent slipped and fell.

I ran, leaving him behind.

Now there were only three players in front of me.

I increased my speed further.

-Mino! Mino! Mino!

-Wow! He dodges another player! He's fast!

-He covers almost 50 meters!

After dodging another player, the opponent acknowledged me and tried to steal my timing with a sliding tackle.

It meant they didn't care even if they got a card.

But my instincts told me.

I could avoid this.

Thud!

I lightly lifted the ball.

At the same time, I jumped to avoid the opponent's sliding tackle and kicked the ball short, breaking into the opponent's danger area.

To anyone watching, it might have seemed like I jumped with the ball.

-Mino! Mino! Mino!

-It's close! It's close! There are only two left in front!

Now there were only two players in front of me.

One defender and the goalkeeper.

The moment getting closer to the goal.

The remaining defender rushed at me.

I pretended to shoot and then cut the ball, causing the last remaining defender to lose his balance and fall.

But even while losing his balance, he touched my foot with his hand, trying to disrupt my shot.

This would definitely be a penalty kick, but.

Wouldn't it be better if I scored?

Well, if I couldn't score, they would give a penalty kick.

The ball floated at a tricky timing.

And I lost my balance too.

But I saw a perfect shooting angle.

I quickly swung my free right foot.

Wham!

The ball hit at a slightly low angle.

I thought it would definitely be a high ball.

And the ball that flew high passed over the goalkeeper, hit the top of the goalpost, and then fell downwards.

Daang!

The goalkeeper hurriedly turned around and reached out with his hand.

It wasn't certain, but the ball that fell right in front of his hand slowly bounced over the goal line.

The defender ran up and cleared the ball.

But I was sure.

The ball had completely crossed the line.

The referee hesitated for a moment, then talked with the VAR assistant referee and made a gesture.

Yeah, the gesture shown when a goal is recognized.

The moment I saw that, I ran quickly towards the direction of the away stands.

"Wooaaahhh! You damn bastard!"

"He's crazy! Crazy! Minooo!!!"

"He ran almost 70 meters! 70 meters!"

My teammates closely following behind me.

But this time I wasn't planning to be the bottom bun in the burger.

I knee-slid in front of the three Koreans who were waving the Taegeukgi.

And with my left hand, I pounded my chest and the emblem.

With my right index finger, I pointed to the Taegeukgi.

Are you watching? Parma.

Are you watching? Korea.

And.

"Keep booing. Lecce!"

* * *

Kim Min-sik.

Park Chan-gyu.

Lee Joo-sung.

The three of them are MiTubers who love soccer.

They travel around the world visiting soccer stadiums, capturing the atmosphere or telling stories, and became famous as travel MiTubers.

This time they visited Parma, Italy.

A few days later, upon hearing that there was a match against Lecce, they managed to get tickets for the away game and visited Lecce.

When they first arrived.

They were worried about the hostile looks they were getting, but fortunately, nothing major happened before they reached the stadium.

On the day of the match.

They headed to the stadium to film for MiTube.

"Wow... It looks as intense as a derby."

"Well, there were several incidents a few days ago."

"Will we be able to leave safely?"

"We won't die. But we might have to be prepared to take a few punches."

Luckily, Parma's Ultras, who also came for the away game, showed goodwill towards them when they saw the Taegeukgi (Korean flag) they were holding.

Conversely, Lecce's home fans beyond the iron bars hurled all sorts of insults at them when they saw the Taegeukgi.

"It's really intense."

"Well, there were several issues."

"Do you think Park Minho will play well?"

"I don't know, but I hope he does well."

And then the match began.

Lecce dominated the early part of the game.

No, Lecce completely seized the upper hand.

"Ah! He's been sent off."

One of the central defenders was sent off.

Unable to overcome the numerical disadvantage, they conceded two goals.

As a result, the atmosphere in Parma's away section was gloomy, while Lecce's home fans nearby were mocking Parma's away fans.

But.

When the second half started.

Not sure what they heard during halftime, but Parma started their counterattack.

The first goal came from Park Minho's assist.

Then, Gennaro Tatis scored another goal with a header, making it 2-2.

Wooaaahhh!

Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!

The Parma away fans, who had been despondent earlier, now raised their voices with renewed energy.

The three Koreans joined in, chanting and cheering loudly for Parma.

And as the atmosphere started to cool down.

The match seemed like it would end as it was.

Eventually.

The regular time ended.

Now only 3 minutes of added time remained.

And just as the added time was given.

The reason they came to this stadium, Park Minho, suddenly started dribbling and sprinting with the ball.

One player.

Then another.

Dodging the players blocking his path with his quick speed, he cleanly evaded the opponent's tackle with a Marseille turn and accelerated even faster.

"Wooaaahhh!"

"Mino! Mino! Run!"

"Minooo!"

The Parma away fans roared like beasts.

Among them, the three Koreans also loudly cheered for Park Minho.

Winning the physical battles.

As Park Minho entered the danger area, he leaped over a sliding tackle with the ball and broke into the penalty area from the side.

The last remaining defender was tricked by his feint and fell, disrupting his shot.

Even while losing his balance, Park Minho managed to shoot, narrowly hitting the top of the goalpost.

The ball that hit the top fell near the goal line.

The defender quickly came to clear the ball.

"Ah! Did that not go in?"

"Referee! Penalty! Penalty!"

Just as everyone was about to argue for a penalty.

Contrary to their expectations, the referee made a gesture indicating that the goal had been scored.

It was only after the scoreboard showed that Park Minho's shot had crossed the goal line that a loud cheer erupted.

Woooaaahhh!

A buzzer-beater with 3 minutes of added time left.

At that moment, Park Minho ran towards them, knee-sliding.

With his left hand, he pounded the emblem.

With his right hand, he pointed to the Taegeukgi, making the three Koreans feel an immense sense of joy and ecstasy.

"Wooaaahhh!"

"Minhooo!"

"Wooaaah! Taegeukgi! Taegeukgi!"

"Korea! Korea! Wooaaahhh!"

"Cheers!"

Eventually.

With the remaining added time over, the game ended with the score 3-2, known as the Pelé score.

The winner was Parma.

Frustrated by the comeback loss to a team with 10 players, Lecce's home fans caused a commotion with flares as soon as the game ended.

The three quickly followed Parma's away fans to leave the stadium, packed their belongings, and swiftly moved to a nearby hotel.

Sitting on the bed and sofa with dazed expressions, they edited the footage they filmed today and pondered a bit.

"What should the title be?"

"Damn... Something really attention-grabbing... Uh? Like! A title that makes you feel like you'll die if you don't watch it?"

While the two were pondering.

The oldest, Lee Joo-sung, quickly wrote the title and started encoding.

"Ah! Hyung!"

"What are you doing!"

But when they saw the title Lee Joo-sung wrote, the two could only nod with a peculiar expression.

A thumbnail showing Park Minho running almost 70 meters with the bold Korean font.

The text was very provocative.

[Channel Name: SoccerTrip]

[Title: Never Underestimate Korea Again!]

The three thought.

This feels good.

It seemed like it would rake in views.
