## 30. Mini Treble! (1)

I was lucky.

It was a relief that I managed to get Ramsdale's jersey after the game.

When I handed the jersey to Monica, she oddly teared up and thanked me.

Does she really like Ramsdale that much?

Indeed, a true fan of Arsenal is different!

I learned something new today.

After sending Arsenal back to London, we invited another guest to our home stadium.

[Second place already? Can Juventus stop Parma’s unstoppable run?]

[Coach Massimiliano Allegri: “Juventus will take the victory against Parma this season.”]

[AI analysis: Juventus, the second-place team in Serie A, has a 1.7% chance of winning the league!]

[Juventus sees a 1.7% chance.]

Our next opponent was Juventus.

They were tied with Inter at 62 points, and unlike their poor first half, quickly climbed to the top four, showing why they are a prestigious club.

But regardless, the result wouldn’t change much.

I have no intention of losing.

-Minhooooo! A perfect winning gooooal!

-What a fantastic goal! Minho scores a stunning goal in the 44th minute of the second half to end the match!

The 31st round of the league against Juventus.

A fierce match that ended in a 2-2 draw.

The person who put the final nail in the coffin was ‘me,’ who playfully teased Monica about Arsenal and got a sharp smack on the back.

With Zbigniew Szczęsny clutching his head in agony behind me, I ran to the fans at Ennio Tardini and pounded the emblem.

“Minhoooooo!”

“Of course! There’s no one like you!”

“Let's go! Mini Treble!”

Goals were getting closer and closer.

As a result, Parma's fans were once again showing the frenzied enthusiasm they exhibited at the end of last season.

A 3-2 victory.

This win brought Parma's championship odds to nearly 99.9%.

In other words, unless a natural disaster occurs, Parma's league victory was certain.

Of course, there was no complacency.

My teammates seemed more concerned about the remaining Coppa Italia and Europa League matches than relaxing.

“Ah... I want to drink.”

Except for the slacker who showed withdrawal symptoms and mumbled that he wished the season would end soon, none of the other players seemed to be slacking off.

The funny thing was that the slacker, who lazed around at the end of the season, was in much better form than during the mid-season. When I think about it, this Argentine guy seemed to perform better when he had some leeway.

Well, the moment that leeway turns into real laziness...

He might become the Argentine pig I saw before, but at least it won’t come to that.

Since joining the national team, he seemed to have a sense of duty, completing the necessary training even if he was slacking off.

Well, he's old enough... He can take care of himself, right?

The next match was the 32nd round against Atalanta.

When we heard the news that Inter had lost the previous match, the players’ eyes lit up.

Winning this match meant winning the league.

It was natural to be motivated.

But.

Maybe because we had been focusing on the Coppa Italia and Europa League lately?

We suffered our second league defeat.

-Atalanta takes three points with a 3-2 win!

-Hahaha! Atalanta’s players are celebrating as if they’ve won the championship! That’s how excellent their performance was today!

-Parma’s triangular pass connections were too inaccurate. Atalanta isolated Parma's offensive line and secured the victory.

Atalanta persistently harassed our midfield line and eventually took the victory.

I was also not in good form, which was very disappointing.

Except for recording one assist, I was completely silent in this match.

Our coach said he was grateful to Atalanta for exposing our weaknesses in preparation for the remaining matches.

“Minho.”

“Yes, coach?”

“Do you have any thoughts about returning to your original position?”

The position I played when I debuted.

The coach suggested I return to the central midfield.

Of course, I had no reason to refuse.

Playing as a forward was fun and great, but I was confident I could perform just as well in the central midfield.

I debuted in that position, after all.

There was no big problem.

Yes, it was time to return to my original position, like Go Gil-dong from "Dooly the Little Dinosaur."

An icy, weighty feeling.

It had been two years!

A long time as a forward...

I was getting tired of it.

Thank you, Atalanta!

It was time to return as Trequartista Park Minho!

* * *

“Damn it... Why are you taking it out on us?”

Renato Mancini, a defender from AS Roma, who had already suffered a heavy 6-3 defeat in the first match, looked at Park Minho with a frustrated expression and muttered.

Parma pulled out a 3-4-2-1 formation for the first time in today’s match.

Coach Alain dropped Park Minho and Filippo Asnelli to the central midfield, causing AS Roma’s defense to face even more difficulties.

-Kenez holds on and passes accurately to Filippo, who turns around!

-And Filippo's pass! Minho! Minho receives it!

-Minho breaks through! Shoooot! Gooooooal! Minhooooooo!

Park Minho, running wild in the central midfield, showed movements similar to AC Milan’s Kaka, shaking Roma.

With decent speed and overwhelming individual skills.

Park Minho, equipped with both, showcased dribbles that were not inferior to the legendary Kaka.

Thanks to him, AS Roma’s defense was struggling.

“Stop running, damn you!”

With Park Minho being positioned in the central midfield and running tirelessly, Gerard Veretout, with a tired expression, shouted in frustration.

As if in response, Park Minho scored multiple goals in today’s match, leading Parma to victory in the second leg of the Coppa Italia semifinals.

-The match is over! Parma advances to the Coppa Italia final again this year, proving last season's miracle was no fluke!

-Can you hear it? The name “Minho” resonating throughout Parma’s home stadium!

Parc! Minho! Parc! Minho!

Parc! Minho! Parc! Minho!

Parc! Minho! Parc! Minho!

Even though the stadium was only half full.

The enthusiasm in the stands was just as explosive as last season.

One elderly gentleman was so overjoyed that he threw his dentures in the air, crying tears of joy, while another fan had written “Parma is Mini Treble, Roma is Mini Trouble!” on his large bottom and danced excitedly.

As soon as the match ended, the fans of both teams almost got into a fight, but it was a trivial matter.

On the way home after the match.

Fans filled the entire city, lining up from the club’s parking lot to Park Minho’s house, forming a path and waving Parma jerseys, chanting his name.

Even the furious AS Roma away fans were scared by the frenzied scene and ran away.

Driving home slowly, Park Minho was astonished by the fans’ reactions.

Throughout the drive, fans lined the streets, chanting his name.

Parc! Minho!

Parc! Minho!

The great Parc Minho!

The god of Parma! Parc! Minho!

When he got home, Monica, with a surprised look, asked, “Aren’t you going to end up staying in Parma forever at this rate?”

Their chanting continued for 30 minutes after Park Minho entered his house, then naturally dispersed as they each returned home.

Watching this, Park Minho wanted even more to give Parma’s fans the gift of a Mini Treble.

Yes, he definitely wanted to complete this fairy tale.

* * *

Parma headed to England again.

For the first leg of the Europa League semifinals.

Against Leicester City.

The media was churning out headlines like “England’s fairy tale team vs. Italy’s fairy tale team.”

Well, it wasn’t a bad title.

It was actually quite decent.

Arriving in Leicester, the county town of Leicestershire in the East Midlands, we were greeted by surprisingly good weather, which made us smile.

Why were we so happy?

Because we didn’t have to play in the rain.

Playing in the rain is really tough.

As summer approached and the frequency of rain decreased, it seemed likely that this match would not be a rainy one.

-TrueMilan: Aaaaaah! Please! Please!

-LoveMilan: LOL It’s easier if you give up?

-KingJuventus: Inter, AC Milan, Juventus all got wrecked in the Champions League LOL

-Roberto: In the end, even Inter got eliminated.

-TrueMilan: Why? Why? Why? We had the squad to win the Champions League! Right?

The group chat I hadn’t checked in a while was filled with friends mocking Inter for getting eliminated from the Champions League.

How can only these troublemakers gather?

It was somewhat fascinating.

-TrueMilan: Why is this season trophyless? Huh? Huh?

-LoveMilan: Ah... We’re all trophyless.

-KingJuventus: Huh? Why is Inter trophyless? They lifted the trophy after beating Parma in the Super Cup.

-TrueMilan: You son of a... That’s just an exhibition match! Winning that doesn’t make me happy!

Ah, they were talking about the Super Cup, a single match between the league champions and the Coppa Italia winners.

Well... Thanks to losing that match to Inter, we could now aim for the Mini Treble.

-Park Minho: (Hamster emoji with a thumbs up)

-TrueMilan: Aaaaah! Minho, I can’t believe you’re making me feel so miserable too!

-LoveMilan: LOL Did you think you would be an exception? Human.

-KingJuventus: I think our Minho is definitely a ‘super AI football machine’ sent from heaven to enlighten the complacent Serie A.

-TrueMilan: You son of a... What complacency brought this disaster upon us? We’re just underdogs!

Indeed, the satisfaction is different.

It’s fun to tease them.

-Park Minho: If you chant “Inter is an underdog” three times, I’ll ‘think’ about transferring to Inter.

-TrueMilan: Inter is an underdog! Inter is an underdog! Inter is an underdog!

-LoveMilan: Milan is an underdog! Milan is an underdog! Milan is an underdog!

-KingJuventus: Juventus is an underdog! Juventus is an underdog! Juventus is an underdog!

I said I’d “think” about it, though?

Moreover, an unexpected person joined in, surprising me.

-Monica: Arsenal is an underdog! Arsenal is an underdog! Arsenal is an underdog!

Monica... Why you too?

Monica was surprisingly sincere.

Arsenal... a scary team.

How can Arsenal have such loyal fans?

I had a strange curiosity.

Leicester City.

A team that wrote a beautiful fairy tale and continued to stay in the upper-mid ranks of the EPL, occasionally achieving good results in various competitions.

And.

The team facing them was writing a new fairy tale in Italy’s Serie A.

Yes, Parma F.C.

With young and promising players like Park Minho, Kenez, Filippo, Gennaro, Santiago, Joshua, etc... Parma’s squad was now comparable to top-tier teams in the league.

Of course, Leicester City’s squad was excellent too.

Starting with goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, players like Youri Tielemans, Donny van de Beek, Wilfred Ndidi, and so on.

With these key players consistently performing, Leicester City climbed to 8th place in the EPL.

Moreover, with Edinson Cavani, on loan from Manchester United, scoring crucial goals, Leicester City reached the Europa League semifinals this season.

Fortunately, Edinson Cavani, who led Leicester City to the Europa League semifinals, was injured.

He wouldn’t be playing in this semifinal, making it a winnable match for Parma, according to several experts.

Of course, Parma didn’t think so.

Even with Edinson Cavani, Parma had the best card that guaranteed victory.

“Minho.”

“Yes?”

“Go to Leicester and show them who the god of Parma is!”

When leaving home for the away match.

Monica hugged Park Minho tightly and cheered him on.

Park Minho, touched, promised to win and left home.

Now, before the match.

Park Minho thought of the few Parma fans who had traveled despite the difficulties due to the new COVID variant.

He stood up, resolved to win today’s match for them.

“Alright! Let’s go show them what we’re made of!”

As he shouted and was about to leave the locker room, Santiago looked at him with an exasperated expression and scolded him.

“We still have five minutes before we go out.”

Park Minho, scratching his nose with an embarrassed look, sat back down.
