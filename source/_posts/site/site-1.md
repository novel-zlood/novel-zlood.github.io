## 1. If You Don't Like It, Do It Yourself! (1)

I love soccer.

But do I want to become a professional soccer player?

Not really.

So, during my middle and high school years, even though I joined the soccer club, I only enjoyed playing soccer casually while dreaming of a different future as I entered the Landscape Architecture department at a university in my hometown.

Even while attending university, I joined the soccer club and enjoyed playing soccer for a semester.

It was fun.

I loved the tactical movements of working with teammates and scoring goals.

Thanks to that, my grades suffered.

As I sowed seeds, I reaped a bountiful harvest.

"First of all... let's go to the military."

I had no choice but to escape to the military.

I didn't want to be beaten to death by my father.

Of course, just because I escaped to the military didn't mean I gave up on soccer.

What is famous about the military?

It's the 'Military League.'

Even in the military, loving soccer as I did, I played soccer with my seniors from the rank of private.

I wasn't particularly good at specialties or work abilities.

But thanks to my soccer skills, I left a good impression on my seniors.

And around the time I became a corporal,

I was appointed as the main striker for the 6th platoon of the 2nd company.

I really enjoyed playing soccer without noticing how time flew.

I still remember the number of goals I scored in 1 year and 9 months.

It was about 170 goals in total.

Thanks to that, I even gave my squad members a reward leave by scoring 11 goals in 6 matches during the division commander's soccer tournament in my last year.

The youngest squad member who received the reward leave saluted me warmly when I was discharged.

Thus, as a 23-year-old young man who re-entered society, I got an unexpected opportunity to study abroad.

Yes.

To Italy, where one of the top 4 leagues in Europe, Serie A, is.

Of course, it wasn't an easy life.

Thanks to the damned coronavirus, the treatment of Asians wasn't good.

There was even a black person who spat out, "Hey chink! Go back to your country!" as I walked by.

Well, I lightly gave him a fist potato, but... honestly, it was a very tense situation.

Still, as I explained to the people I met that I was Korean, not Chinese, most of the unpleasant stares were withdrawn.

That was really fortunate.

Anyway,

It was difficult to find a part-time job.

The gazes around me weren't great either.

But my life in Italy wasn't too bad.

From the time when the so-called 'With Corona' started, I was able to find a job.

Well, I faced racial discrimination often at work.

On the other hand, I met many good friends who protected me, so my first year of studying abroad wasn't bad.

Yes.

It was really an amazing first year of studying abroad.

"Mino! Mino! Hurry up! The match will start soon! Do you know how much I’ve been waiting for today?"

"Yeah, wait a bit. Let me just grab this."

And what made it even more amazing was that I could watch Serie A, one of the top 4 leagues in Europe, with such good friends.

"What are you grabbing?"

"After today's early match, I plan to play a light game at the nearby futsal field."

"Then why are you bringing soccer shoes?"

"There's an amateur soccer field next to it. They might recruit a mercenary, so I need to be prepared."

"Seriously... Mino! You are really persistent."

Yeah, and you, who say pineapple pizza is an insult to pizza, are an even more persistent Italian guy.

* * *

Pre-season.

The period when all soccer teams prepare for the regular season.

Generally, prestigious European clubs also go on overseas tours during this period for training camps.

Of course, that's the story of teams that are moderately popular and have financial leeway compared to other clubs.

According to Roberto, whom I befriended while studying in Italy, the team we are going to cheer for, 'Parma Calcio 1913', went through bankruptcy and relegation.

I roughly knew about it.

It was a strong team recognized in the past during the era of the Seven Sisters of Serie A.

And I also knew that they went bankrupt in 2015 and were re-established in Serie D.

It was a team with quite a story.

I could see why Roberto got so hooked.

Although Parma quickly returned to Serie A, they are currently just an ordinary team in Serie B.

But Roberto loved this team more than anyone.

Thanks to him, I could often watch this team's matches.

"Back then, there was romance. There was also despair during the time when the club name was stripped and they had to start from amateur level."

"Really?"

"That's when it started. The miracle of the Parma team... When the legendary defender Luigi stayed! After seeing that, I decided to love this club until I die."

"It's a great story."

"But last year was a real mess. Worse than any season I've seen..."

Since they were relegated as the bottom of Serie A.

He had every right to be disappointed.

But Roberto's eyes were full of hope.

They had already experienced promotion once.

There was no reason they couldn't do it twice.

He probably thought so.

"But is there some event today? There are a lot more people near the stadium. It's pre-season."

"You didn't know?"

"I'm just a fan who likes watching soccer."

"Sigh."

Roberto shook his head.

Then he took out his smartphone, fiddled with it, and showed me something.

[Become a Parma Player for a Day!]

"What's this?"

Roberto answered my question.

"Usually, you have to register players separately even in pre-season to play in friendly matches and have the right to sit on the bench."

"So what?"

"Due to the pandemic, clubs couldn't afford it, so they got a notice to proceed with the pre-season without player registration this season. They were also told to hold events to draw in some spectators."

What does playing pre-season without player registration have to do with this event? With a puzzled look, Roberto shook his head.

"Don't you want to sit on the team's bench for a day, talk to the players, and see what the club staff do?"

"Sure... that's a dream for any soccer fan."

"It's an event to fulfill such dreams."

"Oh!"

So, it means we can watch this friendly match from the bench?

Even though pre-season tickets are somewhat cheaper than regular season tickets, the amount collected from many spectators can be quite substantial.

So that's why they're doing such an event.

No wonder there were quite a few Parma fans heading to the stadium despite it being pre-season.

Roberto saw my expression and smirked.

"Of course, there are about 4,000 home fans who pre-booked tickets for today's friendly match... They said they would draw two people from them. So don't get your hopes up too much."

Oh.

I got my hopes up for nothing.

The odds were too low.

"Well... I guess I shouldn't expect much."

"And usually, one of those event spots is reserved for a child."

"Ah, that makes sense."

Nodding at Roberto's words, we soon arrived at the entrance gate of the stadium.

I saw fans in various seasons of Parma uniforms lining up with excited expressions to enter.

We joined the line behind them.

People slowly entering.

Then, a child in front of us jumped up and down with joy.

"It's me! It's me! Yahoo!"

A Parma staff member checking season tickets and entry tickets clapped and congratulated the child.

"Congratulations. You're the first winner of today's event!"

Roberto also clapped with a satisfied expression as he watched the smiling child.

"Yeah, events like this are how you gain fans."

The child was guided by another staff member along with a guardian to another entrance.

They were probably guided to the gate used by players, not spectators.

After the brief commotion ended,

People started entering again.

Following the slowly decreasing line, Roberto and I showed our season tickets to the entrance staff to enter, but...

Jingle jingle!

"The last winner has also been chosen!"

The winner was announced.

The person who won the unexpected tour event was Roberto, who had been supporting Parma for a long time.

* * *

"Wow... is this the locker room?"

I saw the child who had been guided before us.

The child was excitedly looking at Parma's locker room.

And so was Roberto next to me.

"Hehehe! It's really worth living long."

"Yeah, it's really worth living long."

After hearing that the event tour was possible for two people including the winner's acquaintance, I was also being guided by a staff member along with Roberto, looking around the stadium.

When they checked our bags before entering, a staff member saw my futsal shoes and soccer shoes in my bag and smiled, saying, "You must really love soccer."

They later told us to look forward to getting signatures on those futsal and soccer shoes.

"Who are you going to get a signature from?"

"Of course, Buffon."

Giovanni Buffon.

He had his prime at Juventus.

He played 176 matches for the Italian national team and is truly called a living legend goalkeeper.

He rejoined Parma, who were relegated to Serie B this year, to be called up to the national team again.

"Sure, there's no goalkeeper like Giovanni Buffon."

"But who do you want to get a signature from?"

"I want to get it from Gianluca Inglese."

He's Parma's key striker.

He may not be a great finisher.

But he runs more than anyone else and is full of competitive spirit.

Chatting with Roberto as we toured casually, it was soon time for the match to start.

The staff guided us to the bench first.

Sitting in the designated seats, Roberto and I exclaimed, "This is where the players watch the field from!"

Soon, the staff from each team took their seats on the bench.

Today's opponent for Parma Calcio 1913 was Cosenza Calcio, also in Serie B.

And the players of both teams entered.

The child sitting in front of me clenched his fist and shouted loudly.

"Gianluca! Kill that idiot Lupí!"

"..."

As expected of a child from Italy, where strong Ultra culture thrives, he spoke harshly.

Roberto also clenched his fist and cheered.

"Yeah! Show them what you've got!"

Well, what's good is good.

I also watched the entering players with keen interest.

At the same time, I felt envy.

What would it feel like to play on such a magnificent field?

Beep!

While I was lost in thought for a moment, the match started.

Cosenza with a 4-5-1 formation and Parma with a 3-3-1-3 formation.

The tactical tendencies of the two teams were completely different.

The way the players unfolded their plays was also different.

Cosenza thickened the center, spreading their two wingers wide to stretch the field.

They seemed to plan to possess the ball in the center and shake Parma's line with long passes to the space created in the sides.

True to the 4-5-1 formation, they seemed to start the game calmly by lowering their line quite defensively.

On the other hand, Parma, despite basing on a three-back formation, showed a very aggressive stance.

Except for Lautaro Valenti positioned in the center, everyone else crossed the half-line actively participating in the attack.

When attacking, it was close to a 1-3-5-1 formation.

Parma's attack, increased to six players, moved organically to target Cosenza's solid defensive line.

Naturally, in the early stages of the game, the side pushing hard was the home team Parma with their aggressive tactics.

- Oooh!

In the 8th minute of the first half,

Parma's central midfielder Franco Vázquez’s pass was received by Valentin Mihăilă, whose mid-range shot was caught by the goalkeeper, going over the goal post.

Following a corner kick,

A fierce header by Gennaro Tutino, who was loaned to Parma from Napoli this season, hit the goalpost and fell in front of Cosenza's defense.

Cosenza's defense barely cleared the ball.

"Why can't they score that?"

At my muttering, Parma's coach sitting in front of me glanced back at me.

Roberto, focused on the game, didn't notice.

Parma's relentless attack continued.

But until the 30th minute of the first half, Parma couldn't score from the 7 shots they took.

Every time a disappointing shot came out, I couldn't help but comment, "If you kick like that, it'll miss," "If you do that, the defense will read and move first," "Hey... even a passing dog would block that shot."

Some people on the bench now openly glared at me.

Roberto finally noticed and pinched my thigh, signaling me to be quiet.

"Do you want to die? Shh!"

But I couldn't help myself.

My mouth was itching.

How could they miss such easy shots?

Even as an amateur, I wouldn't make such ridiculous shots.

Those mistakes were made by professionals.

And what about that player with the belly?

He must have enjoyed eating and drinking too much during the holiday without getting back in shape.

No wonder he missed such easy chances.

It was really frustrating.

In such a situation, Cosenza launched a counterattack.

Cosenza's midfield, thick in the center, managed to steal the ball and sent it wide to the left.

Cosenza's left winger, receiving the ball, sprinted with it and sent a sharp cross.

Thwack!

- Ooooh!

Of course, the finish was a clean header.

One counterattack.

One cross.

One header.

And a score of 1-0.

Cosenza's opening goal in the 44th minute of the first half finally made me unable to hold back my advice.

I turned to Roberto and said,

"Hey, that's not how you play soccer..."

But Roberto looked at me with a puzzled expression.

And instead, Parma's coach Alain Lavagne, who heard my words, stood up and pointed at me, shouting,

"You XX bastard! If you're so confident, get on the field and play yourself!"
