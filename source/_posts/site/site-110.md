## 42. Winter Transfer Market (1)

As soon as Manchester United's League Cup quarter-finals were over, Korean communities were flooded with posts from Manchester United fans.

- So why did they take out Shin Junseo?

- Seriously, Helge's coaching level is... If they had taken out Jason instead, Shin Junseo could have turned the game around.

- LOL, this match was lost because of the coach. Honestly, Shin Junseo and Park Minho are on a similar level, but they got thrashed 3-0 in this match, LOL.

- How can you say a striker who scored 23 goals is on the same level as one who scored only 5?

- This is why I was worried about Shin Junseo going to Manchester United. A combination of Shin Junseo and Manchester United... The community is going crazy with posts about Manchester United and Shin Junseo.

The anger of Manchester United fans criticizing coach Helge for not playing Shin Junseo was overwhelming, while fans of other teams sighed deeply as they saw the bulletin boards filled with Manchester United stories from page 1 to page 5.

- Is this an international football board or a Manchester United board?

- Seriously, as soon as Shin Junseo moved to Manchester United, some fans came out of the woodwork like cockroaches from under the kitchen sink.

- Honestly... they need to make a separate board just for Manchester United fans.

The only reason the boards hadn't completely exploded was that there was still a revenge match scheduled for the New Year.

Most Manchester United fans thought that all they had to do was win the 19th round match at Arsenal's home, the Emirates Stadium.

"Even if we can't win the championship, we have to stop their unbeaten run."

"At least get a draw. We need to repay them for the defeat in the opening match at their home."

"Honestly, the old Manchester United wasn't like this... It feels like the quality of the squad has dropped."

"Let's start the New Year with a big win."

On the other hand, Arsenal, who finished Boxing Day unbeaten, had their fans' expectations soaring as they continued their unbeaten run through December.

Even the older Gooners, who had been quietly watching Arsenal's matches, couldn't help but show their excitement and expectations for a championship this time.

Especially with Park Minho, who transferred to Arsenal and was showing overwhelming performance, fans were calling him not the God of Parma but the God of Arsenal.

Anyway.

The international football community, which had been buzzing with discussions about each team's performance, soon turned its focus to the upcoming winter transfer market.

[Arsenal to offload Pedro Ocampos!]

[Manchester United considering offloading James McGuire?]

[Several big clubs eyeing Arsenal players with reduced playing time!]

[Manchester City planning to sell Karti Mina!]

[Chelsea looking for a replacement for Kante!]

[Real Madrid eyeing Arsenal's Bernard Party?]

Even though the transfer market hadn't opened yet, the media was already spreading various rumors.

Among these, some had a bit of truth mixed in, but most were closer to rumors.

And with the noisy year of 2023 coming to an end, the first match of 2024, the 19th round match between Arsenal and Manchester United, was just around the corner.

* * *

Pedro Ocampos didn't show up at the training ground or the stadium.

There were rumors within the squad that he would transfer to Juventus after today's match.

"It's funny how half our squad is buzzing with transfer rumors."

"Look at Amani. His father really hates Newcastle, but the media is full of rumors about him transferring to Newcastle."

"The funniest one is the rumor about Bernard, who still has three years left on his contract, going to Real Madrid."

"What? They want to take Mino for 200 million euros in the winter? What a ridiculous rumor."

The players seemed quite baffled as transfer rumors spread through various media outlets when they had no intention of leaving.

Hmm... They might not know, but some of it is true.

The article about taking me for 200 million euros is half true.

To be precise, PSG had made an inquiry to take me for 200 million euros this summer.

Of course, I had no intention of transferring to another club unless I achieved some success at Arsenal.

Honestly, I don't have the guts to face Monica's fierce gaze if I did.

Time passed quickly.

January 1, 2024.

Finally, the New Year dawned.

By now, my New Year's greeting must have been posted on Arsenal's SNS.

The fans who had come to the Emirates Stadium were eagerly hoping that Arsenal would take another step towards an unbeaten championship with a victory in today's match.

"The opponents are the Manchester United guys we beat in the League Cup quarter-finals."

"Both sides have rotated their squads, so the lineup will be slightly different from the last match, but tactically, it will likely be similar."

"If we can block Manchester United's flanks, which utilize Andrew Rashford and Shin Junseo, we will dominate the game like we did in the last match."

Our coach's speech, expressing a strong desire for victory, raised the players' focus in the locker room.

I was a bit worried because the lineup consisted mostly of backup players, but considering the tight match schedule, it couldn't be helped.

At least...

My condition wasn't bad today, so I felt I could score some goals against Manchester United.

Football isn't like baseball, where scores like 11-0 are common, but with our attacking squad scoring 2-3 goals in each match, I believed we could achieve a meaningful result today.

Moreover, it wasn't an away game but a home game, so even with a roster close to our second team, I thought we could manage.

"I hope I can play until the second half today."

Before entering the field, I had a brief conversation with Junseo hyung, and it seemed like he was feeling a bit down after being substituted early in the last match.

But with his consistent performance of nearly 10 goals and 10 assists each season, I didn't think it would be a big problem.

As for winning the championship, I wasn't sure.

Ronaldo seemed determined to take revenge this time, but honestly, he looked much heavier compared to the League Cup quarter-finals.

He had two chances in the first half, but ironically, he couldn't replicate the sharp shots from the League Cup quarter-finals.

"That guy's lost his touch."

"Really?"

"Yeah, he's really lost it."

During a brief moment before taking the corner kick, Bernard Party's comment made Liam Murray glance at Ronaldo, who was squinting.

Even I could tell that he had lost his touch compared to the last match.

Moreover, he had only scored one header goal in December, reminding me that time spares no one.

- Mario Fernandez's corner kick!

- Ronaaaaaaldo! Header!

- Aaron Ramsdale catches it! Ah! Ronaldo's header was a bit weak!

- The angle was really good.

As soon as the corner kick ended, our counterattack began.

Marlon Ramsdale quickly threw the ball to the flank.

Casper Nielsen, who caught the ball, quickly dribbled up.

- Casper! He catches the ball and sprints!

- Full-back Casper Nielsen is advancing high up the field, actively joining the attack, while Maximiliano moves to the center like a three-back.

- This is a tactical move that Coach Kike Arteta often used to show, right?

- That's right.

At the same time, Gabriel Artinelli, who was on the flank, moved to the center and connected the ball.

Gabriel, who saw me turning inside, made a pass towards my feet.

Seeing the ball cross the half-line in just 6 seconds, Manchester United hurriedly reorganized their defense.

Especially James McGuire's slow feet were a problem.

Of course, I loved those slow feet.

As I lightly pushed forward, I saw James McGuire trying to body-check me.

This is why slow-footed players always carry some risk when defending.

And this is also why coaches of strong teams prefer fast defenders.

As I gently nudged the ball and sped past, James McGuire slipped as if hit by a tranquilizer dart.

- Mino! He quickly gets past James McGuire! Faster! He speeds up and pushes forward!

- Raphael Varane rushes to block Mino! It's an unavoidable situation!

Raphael Varane, who abandoned his defensive position, quickly rushed towards me.

Thanks to this, a large space opened up in the center, and I didn't miss it and made a pass to that spot.

- Gabriel Artinelliiiii!

- Shooooot! Aaaah! Jordi De Gea's super saveeeee!

- De Gea saves Manchester United here! Amazing!

Gabriel grabbed his head in frustration.

Honestly, it was almost a perfect pass, and missing it was a bit disappointing, but I gave him a thumbs-up anyway.

More than that, De Gea was really insane.

What kind of person can still leap like a grasshopper at his age?

Really an amazing person.

Moreover, seeing Manchester United so often lately, they were starting to feel familiar.

- Corner kick situation.

- Axel Odegaard moves to the left corner to take the corner kick. Arsenal has recently enjoyed success with low corner kicks.

I might as well show something.

That I'm an attacker who also uses his "head."

As I subtly signaled, I saw Odegaard nodding.

I planned to target the low ball.

James McGuire, sticking close to my side, was a bit worrying, but it should be fine somehow.

- Odegaard's corner kick!

- It's a low and fast ball! Mino moves in!

- Mino header! Gooooooal!

- Minooooo! His 30th goal of the season! His 24th league goal!

I was slightly nudged by James McGuire, but it seemed to have blocked De Gea's view.

The ball that deflected off my head slipped under the goalkeeper's arm and shook the net.

Waaaaaaaah!

Mino! Mino! Mino! Mino!

The Emirates Stadium was naturally filled with cheers.

As soon as I scored, I ran to the fans with my arms wide open, feeling like I was being worshipped by fanatics.

"Can't believe Arsenal has a player like this."

"It's only January... He already has 30 goals this season? Really? Really?"

"Our team finally has a crack!"

"Can we really trust this? My inner child says he won't leave for another team, right?"

I heard something strange in the middle, but anyway, the Gooners at the stadium expressed their happiness loudly.

The players also ran to congratulate me on the goal.

"Already 30 goals this season! Mino is really different."

"Alright, let's break the record for most goals in a single season!"

"Was that Messi's record?"

"Did he already break the record for most attacking points in a single season?"

"Mino is a god!"

Anyway.

Manchester United, which had been attacking aggressively like in the last match, conceded the first goal from our counterattack.

And on the way back after celebrating, I saw Ronaldo and Derek De Jong arguing.

It seemed like they were blaming Ronaldo for not stopping Casper Nielsen, the starting point of the counterattack.

Well, this depends on the player's style, so I can't say who is at fault.

But I don't think fighting on the field is right.

They should fight in the locker room later.

Fighting on the field only escalates emotions.

I glanced around and saw Junseo hyung with a frowning face, watching the two argue.

Hmm... It's quite ironic that Junseo hyung, who left Tottenham for a championship, ended up at Manchester United.
