## 12. Giant Killing (1)

- The game is over!

- Parma has made a great start to the second half of the season with a 5-2 victory over Como.

We won the game against Como 5-2.

Como, who conceded two goals in the first half, was heavily shaken and beaten by us until the second half.

Even though Como scored two goals in an attempt to chase us,

they couldn't catch up with the five goals we had already scored.

While we could give good marks for the effectiveness shown when I played like a target man on the flanks,

at the same time, if Franco was heavily pressured when passing me the ball, our offense became frustrating.

Also, considering that our defensive organization wasn't as solid as in the first half,

it was clear that we still had a long way to go.

The coach seemed to know this too.

Even after the game ended, he seemed to have a lot on his mind.

On the bus ride back to Parma, he had a long conversation with Matteo, the assistant coach.

As for me, I watched a popular Korean drama on Netflix with Bbanjiri.

When Bbanjiri got sleepy and took a nap, I finally looked through articles about today's game and checked out the Korean overseas football community to get a sense of the atmosphere.

Honestly, I was curious.

How would my performance be evaluated in Korea?

[Park Minho! A stunning play in the first game of the second half, recording 1 goal and 1 assist!]

[This is a 'crack'! Park Minho's 30-meter breakthrough! Como's defense fell like autumn leaves!]

[Park Minho, who recorded 20-20 in the first half! How many attacking points will he record in the second half?]

[March friendly match scheduled! The Korean national team to play friendlies against Germany and Turkmenistan!]

[Coach Pedro: 'I consider it the last chance to check the best resources, including Park Minho.']

[Comments]

- Wow... He was insane. He played like Messi.

- Messi doesn't play like that though?

- No, I just meant he played the game like Messi; who thinks he resembles Messi?

- Anyway, our guy is much better than the dwarf.

- Haha, Jolly Du Sudinㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Skipped the awards ceremony 4 times alreadyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ The greatest no-show in history that even Messi can't catch up to!

- Anyway... Park Minho will definitely transfer to a big club after this season, right?

- Well... Park Minho is certainly a player that suits Barcelona... He even has a Messi-like aura.

- But first, Barcelona needs to sort out their finances...

- How can Barca afford to sign Park Minho when they brought in 38-year-old Toni Alves for 150,000 euros to replace him?

- Park Minho's value is pretty high now... Culé...

-ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Barca really has become a beggar clubㅋㅋㅋ

- Barca might be a mess this season, but we have next season.

- Sir... The future of Barca you're talking about, it's not Freddy Dembele, is it?

As I read through the comments about me,

it eventually led to a debate between Messi and Ronaldo,

and finally ended with talks about Barcelona's finances.

Most of the discussions about me in the community were about 'where will Park Minho transfer after completing one season with Parma?'

Most of them were certain I would transfer to a mid-to-upper-tier team in one of the top 4 leagues.

A transfer...

Honestly, it's not something I thought about much.

Leo just told me, 'We'll move to a bigger club once this season is over.'

I figured it would happen eventually.

But thanks to my overwhelming performance in the first half, that foggy future was gradually becoming clearer.

"A transfer..."

"Growl! Bark! Bark!"

Not again...

I can't understand why Bbanjiri makes dog sounds in his sleep.

Is he going to bite someone later?

I remember seeing a video...

Suarez? He bit someone.

I hope Bbanjiri doesn't end up like that.

* * *

After a short rest in Parma, we headed back to Rome.

It's exhausting.

Consecutive away games build up fatigue.

The only fortunate part is that this time we're taking a plane instead of the team bus.

The unfortunate part is that there's no airport in Parma, so we have to take a bus to Linate Airport in Milan.

"Meow!"

Now it's cat sounds.

I'm starting to wonder if Bbanjiri is secretly a rich furry.

Otherwise, I can't understand why he makes animal sounds when he sleeps.

It's a somewhat long distance by bus.

But it's a very short distance by plane.

I wanted to try the gelato at G.passi, one of Rome's top three gelato places... but the route there is a bit rough, so I decided against it.

The area around Rome's Termini Station is known to be dangerous like a Harlem, as per the stories among students studying abroad.

We have a match against AS Roma in a few days.

Getting hurt, even slightly, could be a big problem.

Santiago looked like he wanted to go,

but when I scared him a bit, he kept his mouth shut.

This guy is quite a scaredy-cat too.

-Monica: Ah! Rome Termini Station? That area is a bit like Harlem, there are quite a few gypsies.

-Monica: When I was traveling there, a group of gypsies followed me from a distance and I got scared.

-Monica: I asked a Korean tourist to accompany me to get out of that alley.

Seeing that Monica knew about it well,

it seemed to be a known area to avoid even among locals.

Ah! And Monica sent me a photo she took, saying it was for a photoshoot.

She's always beautiful.

I replied that I would show her Adebayor's reverse sprint in the match against AS Roma.

-Monica: Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Do you want to die? Do you want to die?

She threatened to kill me.

To an Arsenal fan, Adebayor is indeed a sore point.

What kind of club is Arsenal?

Why does Monica turn into a grumpy cousin who can't get married and is disgruntled with society whenever it involves Arsenal?

I couldn't understand.

* * *

I found out why Bbanjiri makes animal sounds in his sleep.

He dreams of owning his own zoo.

He loved animals since he was young.

He still loves animals now.

So, he became a football player to earn money.

At the same time, he became interested in football.

Now, he’s a player who loves football more than anyone.

Well, money is money,

but he also loves hearing the cheers of the fans.

He said he plans to build a small zoo in Argentina and spend his retirement there.

Anyway,

Bbanjiri needs money to build a zoo.

To do that, he needs to succeed as a football player.

To succeed as a football player, he needs to play well.

Of course, that's not enough.

To earn money, he needs to be famous.

For that, he needs to prove his skills to everyone.

And today's match seems like the best opportunity for Bbanjiri and me to increase our value.

The opponent is AS Roma, ranked 3rd in Serie A.

We are an underdog team from Serie B.

Even before stepping onto the field, the heat from the home fans was palpable.

Moreover, the away locker room, which subtly affected the mentality of the away team.

Every aspect said we were at a disadvantage.

Besides, their manager was a renowned figure who had lifted numerous trophies in the past.

Their players were better than ours in every way.

In the short period we had to prepare for today's game,

we did what we could.

We also filled in the gaps from the match against Como.

The opponent would have already prepared for us.

But strangely, it didn't feel like we would lose.

"How do you feel about being the underdog?"

Everyone's attention was drawn to Alain Lavagne's words.

Yes, this is what it feels like to be the underdog.

"Next season, we will have to approach every game with this feeling."

"We, who are the overwhelming top dogs in Serie B... will be a relegation-threatened team in Serie A."

"So, go out there with confidence. If we show our football, the opponent will crumble."

After the coach's speech, it was time to step onto the field.

I thought about my new matchup.

The left-back was not Castos Vinha, who was physically inferior to me.

It was a 186 cm tall left-back, Costanza Spinazzola.

The opponent had prepared as well.

They knew where we would target.

Though not great at defending, he wouldn't lose to me in aerial battles.

But it wasn't a big problem.

We had also prepared Plan B.

As we stepped onto the field,

we shook hands with the Roma players.

Honestly, it was a bit surreal.

Some of the players were those I had seen in past videos.

Especially Henrikh Mkhitaryan, I occasionally watched videos of him when he was at Manchester United.

Our deputy commander was a Man U fan.

He really liked it when I showed similar plays to this guy and would buy me frozen food and instant noodles.

I wonder if he's a sergeant now.

"Mino. Did you see?"

"Yeah, he's 5 cm taller than me."

"Then... Plan B?"

"Coach said if it's not Castos Vinha, then switch to Plan B immediately."

Santiago nodded.

When I turned my head, Coach Martinho looked puzzled while watching the starting lineup.

Dennis Man was at the center.

It was the first time a player other than Gennaro Tatis or Gianluca was placed at the forefront.

It was bound to feel strange.

Just as they seemed to read our thoughts,

we read theirs.

Beep!

As the referee blew the whistle to signal the start of the match,

the players placed in the second line began to move.

Just as we had discussed beforehand.

* * *

"Se foda!"

A rough curse burst from Coach Martinho's mouth.

Parma had prepared for them, placing Costanza on the left instead of Castos Vinha.

But Parma's movements were different.

"Mino is in the center?"

Parma, who quickly switched to a 3-4-3 formation as soon as the game began, used Park Minho as the center forward.

A center forward?

I had heard that he played as a forward for the national team.

But for Parma, he mostly played in the second line.

I couldn't understand.

Suddenly placing him as the main striker.

"Whatever reason they had for placing that player in the center, we just need to stop him."

The pressure between the first and second lines is different.

Coach Martinho believed that Park Minho would be stifled by Roma's defense.

But something felt ominous. If they changed it like that, there must be a reason.

"I can't understand..."

Just as Coach Martinho was about to criticize the opposing coach's ignorance and point out Park Minho's weaknesses,

Wooaaaaaah!

Mino! Mino! Mino!

Go, Minooooo!

A loud cheer erupted from the away section at Stadio Olimpico.

It was a cheer that came just five minutes into the first half.

When Coach Martinho hurriedly turned his eyes, Park Minho was already shaking the net between two defenders.

Mino! Mino! Park Mino!

Mino! Mino! Park Mino!

Mino! Mino! Park Mino!

Parma's away fans chanted his name.

Park Minho, who scored the goal, clenched his fist.

Coach Martinho was dumbfounded as he watched the scene.

In just five minutes, Roma had conceded the first goal.

* * *

When I stood in the center,

I thought about the type of defenders I would be facing.

Chris Smalling.

Over 190 cm tall, excellent in aerial duels, and fast, making him a tough defender for attackers.

Of course, his weaknesses are his poor foot skills,

and he tends to make crucial mistakes due to lapses in concentration.

Arunsh Kumbulla.

This guy is similar in height to Chris.

Additionally, he is very forward-thinking,

and he is good at reading the game and has excellent football intelligence, often intercepting dribbles or passes with his strong physique and defensive skills.

His weakness is also his below-average foot skills.

In other words, he is not skilled at passing build-ups.

He also lacks experience and often makes silly fouls or leaves spaces behind.

They are not easy opponents,

but not impossible to deal with.

When I moved to the center, both defenders looked at me with bewildered eyes.

I guess they were taken aback by a skinny guy who usually played in the second line suddenly moving between them.

AS Roma's initial attack was interrupted.

A somewhat disappointing flow for a strong team.

On the contrary, this situation was an opportunity for us.

The ball that was intercepted in the middle was connected to Franco, who had moved down to the third line. Seeing that, I immediately moved down and asked Franco for a pass.

"Franco!"

Tuk!

And as soon as I received the ball, I shielded it from the pressing opposing midfielder, returned it to Franco, and turned away.

Tat!

At the same time, the ball was passed back to me.

With a 2-on-1 pass, I quickly bypassed one player.

Holding the ball, I sprinted forward like a bullet.

I saw an opening in their defense.

These guys were underestimating us.

How do I know?

The space is more generous than I expected.

-Mino! Mino is rapidly advancing! With a 2-on-1 pass, he has bypassed one player and increased his speed!

-Too much space for Roma! Maybe it's because the game just started, but their defense looks a bit disorganized!

As I moved deeper,

Roma's midfielder Jordan Veretout quickly ran towards me and stretched out his leg.

But what can you do?

I've recently gained some muscle, so I'm slightly faster now.

Of course, it doesn't show much,

but in the actual game, this small difference makes a big difference.

Yes, just like this.

-Mino! Minoooo! He bypassed with speed!

-He's very fast! He was always fast, but... he wasn't this fast, right?

I ran to the targeted spot.

Chris Smalling.

This guy... well, he's older than me, so I should call him sir.

I aimed for the left side of Sir Smalling.

As I darted between Roma's left-back Costanza and Chris Smalling,

both players marked me closely and pressed from both sides.

But Dennis Man cut into the empty space on the flank created by Costanza marking me.

Seeing that, I immediately passed.

At the same time, I moved back to the center.

Dennis had 'promised' to cross immediately.

A low, fast, whip-like cross was sent in.

Between Chris Smalling and Arunsh Kumbulla.

I didn't jump high.

The two defenders, about 10 cm taller than me, left a gap.

If I didn't score from this, I'd be a fool.

I timed my shot and instinctively hit a half-volley with the curling cross.

Wham!

Splash!

-Goal! Mino! Parma's Mino scores the opening goal against AS Roma just five minutes into the first half! With organic movements, he completely disrupts AS Roma's defense!

-As a center forward, Mino is definitely different! Roma's central defenders couldn't predict his movements!

-Was this player always like this? It's truly impressive! He continuously moved to positions the defenders couldn't anticipate and finally scored!

Phew.

I was lucky.

I rashly attempted a half-volley.

It slightly mis-hit my foot, honestly making me nervous.

Pretending it wasn't a mistake, I tried to smile through it.

Bbanjiri stared at my face for a while, then asked with suspicious eyes,

"Did you mis-hit that volley?"

“...”

This guy is surprisingly perceptive at times like these.
