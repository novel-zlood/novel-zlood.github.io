## 48. Another Victory! (3)

Monica recently had a dream.

It was about the time when Arsenal was competing for the 4th place in the league during the 2021-22 season and suffered a 3-0 defeat to Palace.

She thought it was a bad dream.

To be precise, she thought it was just a "silly dream."

Coincidentally, a few players were injured right before the FA Cup final, just like in her dream.

But her worries were short-lived.

Arsenal started leading the game in the first minute with a goal from Park Minho.

"Kyaaa! Yes!"

Ignoring her recent silly dream, Monica clenched her fist and let out a loud pterodactyl scream.

Watching Arsenal dominate the game after scoring the first goal, Monica predicted Arsenal's victory.

Of course, Bournemouth wasn't a team to go down without a fight.

- Payne Scarlett! Equalizer! In the 12th minute, Bournemouth's striker Payne Scarlett levels the match again!

- Kasper Nielsen lost his mark momentarily, and the cross came in, leading to a goal.

- The movement to turn around and get in position was impressive.

"Ah..."

Monica stared blankly at the screen.

She had never expected them to concede a goal here.

At the same time, her silly dream started creeping back into her mind.

While Monica was feeling down for a brief moment, Arsenal took the lead again.

This time, it was a long-range shot from Bruno Campos.

- Goooooooal!

- Bruuuuno Campos!

- Arsenal leads again, 2-1! Bruno Campos scores with a brilliant long-range shot!

- Goalkeeper Juan Zurinho followed it well, but the trajectory of Bruno Campos's shot was too good.

As soon as Arsenal took the lead again, Monica, who had switched her mood, clenched her fist and cheered.

Arsenal leading 2-1.

Monica, smiling brightly, forgot her silly dream once again.

Yeah, a silly dream is just a silly dream.

Thinking that, she continued to watch the broadcast.

Bournemouth scored again.

- In the 35th minute, Bournemouth levels the match again! What an intense game!

- Again, from the left side! Arsenal must really miss Kieran Tierney's presence!

- Payne Scarlett's second goal! Bournemouth levels the match again, 2-2!

"Ah..."

Monica, whose mood had been fluctuating for just 35 minutes, looked at the TV with a hollow expression.

If anyone had been beside her, they might have looked at her with a worried expression, fearing she might turn into the protagonist from the movie 'Joker.'

Nevertheless, Arsenal was still Arsenal.

Despite Bournemouth's fierce counterattacks, Arsenal took the lead again in the 44th minute, making it 3-2.

- Amaaaaaani Richards!

- He scores! Amani Richards scores!

- What a thrilling game! Arsenal leads Bournemouth again, 3-2 with a classic scoreline!

- Five goals in the first half! It's a goal fest at Wembley Stadium!

Laughing and crying like someone with bipolar disorder, Monica sank into the sofa, exhausted, and let out a long sigh.

Mumbling that she might really collapse from exhaustion, she drank a glass of cold water.

Beep!

In added time of the first half, Bournemouth earned a penalty.

Seeing this, Monica screamed.

"Kyaaa!"

Monica's pterodactyl scream filled the house.

She couldn't help but frown, recalling the moment Arsenal lost 3-0 to Palace.

* * *

Facing a 3-3 score as the first half ended, we didn't look too happy.

Honestly, contrary to our thoughts of giving them a good beating, Bournemouth's attack was quite fierce.

Especially Casper Nielsen, who was being relentlessly attacked from the left, came into the locker room with a dazed expression, chewing half a banana.

Honestly, we expected this.

The left flank would be relentlessly attacked.

And our attackers thought they would tear apart Bournemouth's defense just as much.

Although we weren't happy with the scoreline, the overall performance was not bad.

As I thought, our coach didn't criticize the performance.

He said there were no issues with our performance and told us to carefully navigate the second half while focusing on Casper's mental state.

Since Casper needed a lot of experience and time, none of the players showed any dissatisfaction towards him.

Only a few players are nearly perfect from their youth.

After halftime, the second half resumed.

Bournemouth, confident with the 3-3 scoreline, started the second half much more aggressively.

- Bournemouth! Pushing hard against Arsenal from the start of the second half.

- They keep targeting Arsenal's left side, don't they?

Bournemouth's approach hadn't changed.

They seemed to believe that attacking the left side repeatedly would create openings like in the first half.

It's not a bad strategy.

But it seemed like Bournemouth underestimated Arsenal.

"Ah!"

Arsenal was not a team to repeat first-half mistakes in the second half.

- Jake Francis intercepts the ball!

- Jake Francis covers for Casper Nielsen's lack of defensive skills.

- Jake takes the ball and sends it long.

It felt similar to the situation in the first minute of the first half.

Jake Francis's intercepted ball headed towards Lorenzo Lupo.

Thump!

Lorenzo Lupo lightly received the ball with his head, then turned to protect the ball and, seeing me running towards the flank, sent a strong pass to the opposite side.

- Minhooo! Minho!

- The ball connects to Minho! Minho has the ball in a free space!

- Bournemouth! In danger!

- Allen Ducky's tackle! But Minho! Easily evades and charges forward for a shoooot!

Thwack!

With the sound of the ball hitting leather, the ball left my foot and went past Bournemouth's goalkeeper Juan Zurinho, shaking the net.

Splat!

Bournemouth, conceding a goal from a sudden counterattack.

As soon as my goal went in, my teammates ran towards me, clenching their fists and shouting.

"Hahaha! Minhooo!"

"This is it!"

"Nice! Niceeee!"

"Come oooon!"

The score widened to 4-3.

Despite conceding, Bournemouth's players didn't look too disheartened.

They encouraged each other, confident they could catch up again like in the first half.

But this wasn't the first half anymore.

Arsenal, fully prepared, started actively countering Bournemouth's attacks.

Especially on the left side, where they reinforced the defense asymmetrically, pushing Casper Nielsen up as a winger and focusing on defense with defensive midfielder Jake Francis acting as a wing-back.

Casper Nielsen, a type of fullback who doesn't drop back when he goes up, showed performances comparable to Kieran Tierney when attacking.

Such talent was the reason he continued to get opportunities despite being heavily targeted.

Splat!

Casper Nielsen's goal ended Bournemouth's pursuit.

Seeing Casper score from my heel kick pass, the Gooners roared with joy.

Wooooooaaaaaaah!

The score was now 5-3.

With the score now 5-3, Bournemouth's players' expressions hardened.

Indeed, the Championship League champions were different.

They managed to score 3 goals against us.

But, of course, it wasn't a problem for us.

We just needed to score more than them.

* * *

Beep! Beep! Beep!

Payne Scarlett sat down in his spot.

The young prospect, who had envisioned a chance at victory by scoring three goals in the first half, felt the difference between the two teams in the second half and couldn't help but collapse.

"Why can't we win even though we keep scoring?"

In a normal match, Bournemouth's 3 goals would have secured a victory, but Arsenal was different from the teams he had faced before.

Whenever Bournemouth managed to score a hard-earned goal, Arsenal would easily equalize and catch up.

Moreover, in the second half, they completely nullified the pattern of targeting Casper Nielsen and secured a 5-3 victory without conceding any more goals.

Even the 2 goals they conceded in the second half were quickly nullified by Arsenal's easy goals, leaving Payne Scarlett feeling empty.

Although the scoreline was close, it wasn't a satisfying match in terms of performance.

Ronnie Mowbray, with a blank expression.

And goalkeeper Juan Zurinho, sitting on the field and crying, came into view.

Watching his teammates, Payne Scarlett felt a mix of guilt and a small dilemma.

'If it's this tough against Bournemouth, which invested heavily for a Championship League team... Can Tottenham, losing many key players this season, beat this Arsenal?'

Thinking of the trophy-less history of his respected striker Harriet Kane, Payne Scarlett recalled a recent message from his agent.

"Was it Inter?"

Payne Scarlett's face was full of contemplation.

In his eyes, the spark of a transfer began to grow.

Then, the FA Cup trophy ceremony began.

With Tierney in the hospital, vice-captain Magalhaes took a deep breath and lifted the trophy high.

At that moment, the Gooners at Wembley Stadium erupted in joyous cheers.

[Arsenal! FA Cup Champions!]

[Arsenal dominates the League Cup, FA Cup, and EPL! Only the Europa League remains!]

[2023-24 Europa League final will be held at Armenia's Razdan Stadium!]

[Arsenal vs. Lazio! Who will be the winner?]

And.

As soon as the FA Cup ended, football fans turned their eyes towards the Europa League final and the Champions League final.

The Europa League final featured Arsenal and Lazio.

The Champions League final featured Liverpool and Real Madrid.

Thus, the final matchups were set.

[Salah vs. Mbappe! Minho vs. Fabio Immobile! The showdown of the top strikers from each team!]

* * *

Who is the top scorer in the Europa League?

Korean football fans who only watch Korean player broadcasts might naturally assume Park Minho is the top scorer.

But that information is completely different.

Currently, the top scorer in the Europa League is, ironically, Fabio Immobile, the key striker for Lazio, Arsenal's opponent.

[Fabio Immobile! 19 goals in the Europa League! Leading Lazio to the final with an incredible scoring pace!]

Fabio Immobile, with only 6 goals in the league, led Lazio to the final with an impressive goal tally in the Europa League, rivaling Messi or Ronaldo.

Naturally, this incredible scoring pace drew media attention.

[Fabio Immobile, with 19 goals and 1 assist in the Europa League vs. Minho with 16 goals and 7 assists! The showdown of two monstrous strikers!]

[Who is the best striker in the Europa League?]

[Fabio Immobile: "I will score more goals than Arsenal's Minho to lead my team to the Europa League victory."]

With Fabio's interview adding fuel to the fire, fans of both teams showed great interest, making it one of the most anticipated Europa League finals ever.

Of course, Park Minho didn't hold back from making bold statements.

[Minho: "Fabio? Isn't he the player with just 6 league goals? I scored 46 goals... I don't understand why people compare him to me."]
