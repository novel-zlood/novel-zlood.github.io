## Chapter 13. Hat Trick? I'll Do It! (1)

“It's one mountain after another.”

“It's Inter, after all.”

“I feel like our coach's career has been jinxed.”

“Our coach? Why?”

On the flight back to Parma.

Everyone's attention turned to Gianluca's words.

Even our coach Alain seemed curious, stealing glances in our direction.

“When our coach was in France, he always faced strong teams like PSG, Marseille, Monaco, and Lyon in the lower rounds of the cup competitions.”

“Oh! During his first career?”

“Does that mean we'll get promoted just like Bastia did during his first career?”

“So, what was our coach's record in the French League Cup back then? He must have reached the finals, right?”

Contrary to everyone's hopeful gazes.

Gianluca scratched his chin awkwardly.

“We met PSG in the third round and got knocked out 7-0.”

Everyone burst into laughter at that.

Some players even praised, “At least our coach has grown! Parma made it to the quarterfinals!”

To me, it seemed like a jinx...

But since it was a compliment, I had nothing more to say.

Fortunately, our coach also laughed and shook his head.

However, I had a feeling that those who laughed would experience some intense training with the coach tomorrow.

Since I didn't laugh, I'm off the hook.

But Santiago, who laughed, would have to run more, right?

Just as we were noisy after beating AS Roma, our group chat became lively when we learned our next opponent was Inter.

- RealMilan: Minho, I'm sorry, but... the world of victory is a harsh one.

- RealMilan: I'll show you the strength of the world's best, Inter!

- LoveMilan: The world's best?

- RealMilan: Laugh^^

- LoveMilan: Yes! ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ

A man who lives under his wife's thumb and a confident woman.

It didn't sit well with me.

Should I tease him a bit?

- Park Minho: If Inter is the world's best, I guess I have to play like crazy against them.

- RealMilan: ?

- Park Minho: I'll make a hat trick against Inter. My first professional hat trick will be against Inter!

- RealMilan: What? Minho?

- RealMilan: Excuse me? Mister! Mr. Park Minho! What do you mean a hat trick all of a sudden? Huh?

- RealMilan: Mister?

- LoveMilan: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

- KingWangJangJuve: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

- Roberto: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I felt relieved.

But I really wanted to score a hat trick against Inter.

Like what Van Persie said.

The little kid inside me whispered.

Let's score a lot against Inter.

- Monica: Minho! Did you curse Arsenal again?

What's this?

As soon as I had a disrespectful thought about Arsenal, Monica immediately noticed and texted me.

Do Arsenal fans have some kind of superpower?

It's getting a bit scary now.

* * *

January 23rd.

Serie B Round 21 against Vicenza.

- It's different! The quality of the team is different!

- Was Parma Calcio always this strong? Vicenza is completely disoriented.

- The number of shots is already 20 times different!

- Parma! They're aggressively attacking Vicenza!

After our victory against AS Roma.

We seemed to have grown a step further.

Although we are in the relegation zone.

We are having a blast against a relatively strong Vicenza.

I recorded 1 goal and 2 assists.

The current score is 7-0, with us dominating.

Honestly, I wondered if this team was always this easy to play against.

It was somewhat expected.

We faced AS Roma, known for their defensive quality in Serie A.

The defense of a Serie B relegation zone team felt too easy.

Yes, it's relative.

Isn't there a saying?

A player celebrated for their flashy dribbles in another league would be criticized for the same dribbles in the top 4 leagues.

We were feeling that relative difference.

Just like now.

- Minho! As soon as Vicenza's attack fizzles out, they start a counterattack!

- Starting on the right in the first half and now playing centrally in the middle of the game!

- He's fast! Recently, there's been talk that Parma's most confident attack route is Minho's breakthrough, highlighting his speed and dribbling as powerful weapons recognized by everyone!

Recently, my speed had slightly increased.

I could feel the difference, and it felt good.

Normally, I would stop here.

Thud!

- Minhoooooo! He runs even faster! He just crushes the opponent with his speed!

- He quickly penetrates the danger zone! He's overwhelming the opponent with pure physicality!

There was no need to stop now.

Seeing Vicenza's defenders trying to pressure me, I passed the ball forward to Santiago, who was moving to the side.

Santiago displayed some fancy footwork, bypassing the defender and comfortably crossing the ball.

- Santiagooooooo!

- Gennaro Tatis receives the ball and drops it!

- And Minho's shooooot!

- Gooooooaaaaaaal!

Santiago's cross.

Gennaro Tatis receives the ball with his back to the goal.

And I finish it.

Despite this being a pattern Vicenza allowed several times today, they couldn't stop it.

It was a matter of weight class.

- Minhoooooo! He records 2 goals and 2 assists, marking his 25th goal of the season!

- Fantastic combination! Fantastic goal!

- The score is now 8-0!

The Vicenza players, plunged into despair.

I felt sorry for them for a moment, seeing them with their heads down.

But I didn't send them any sympathy.

Because we are professionals.

Yes, because we are professionals.

* * *

“It feels complete.”

Coach Alain Levagne felt it.

Minho Park's unstable elements had disappeared.

Of course, there were still many parts to improve.

But the major weaknesses had mostly disappeared.

He felt that the moment of parting with Minho Park was approaching.

Of course, the season was only halfway through.

And there was still a small hope for Parma, so he hadn't given up hope.

But parting was inevitable.

Look at those scouts.

“Man Utd, Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City, Real Madrid, Barca, Bayern... I recognize all their faces.”

Who do you think they came to see?

All of them came to see Minho Park.

The monster who recorded 25 goals and 23 assists this season.

But what about Minho Park's value?

Because of a damn buyout clause, he was on the market for a meager price.

Since the transfer window hadn't closed yet, some clubs offered to let Minho Park play on loan at Parma for a year if they bought him now.

That impatient board was breathing heavily, wondering when they could sell Minho Park.

It was frustrating.

Stupid board.

A player who could bring in money just by being on the team...

And they were obsessed with that measly transfer fee...

Whistle! Whistle! Whistle!

Just as the game ended.

The score was 8-0, Parma's complete victory.

With this, we reached 20 wins.

The unbeaten streak continued.

Minho Park, who recorded 2 goals and 2 assists today, naturally approached the reporter and started an interview.

Seriously... Whose son is he? He's really handsome.

Seeing that handsome face made me even more frustrated.

Coach Alain Levagne, feeling frustrated, dumped an innocent sports drink into the trash, calling it lukewarm.

* * *

Recently, many forces have been trying to undermine me.

Oh, it's not serious, though.

[Title: So, has Minho ever scored a hat trick?]

- Content: I know Minho is good... but I think he lacks the ability to score in bursts.

- The real top player is someone like Lorenzo Lupo. He quickly rose to 3rd place in scoring after scoring in a burst.

- In my opinion, Minho is a level below Lorenzo Lupo as a forward.

[Comments]

- Is a player with 21 league goals and 19 assists a joke to you?

- Is this a Pisa fan?

- No, Pisa fans have too much conscience to say that. Probably Alfredo from Ternana or his fan.

- Wow, Lorenzo Lupo is really good; he already has 14 goals? It feels like just yesterday he had 4...

- Minho lacks the ability to score in bursts? A player who records almost 2 attacking points per game?

They said I lacked the ability to score in bursts.

Even though I create almost 2 attacking points per game.

Is that not enough?

Then I have to prove it.

A pro must speak with their skills.

Since Gennaro will miss the next game due to accumulated yellow cards, the coach will likely put me in the front line.

I have to show it in this game.

How well I can score goals.

To do that, I need to learn from a player who scores well...

I've already found a good teacher.

The internet is a sea of information.

“Let's see...”

The best player who scores goals like crazy!

A player whose goal-scoring ability is second to none, even Messi!

The sexiest man!

A man who fits perfectly in a big club!

Messi's eternal rival!

Yes, the man everyone knows.

“Yeah, it's Lewandowski.”

* * *

[Minho! In the interview, say, ‘A fan said I lacked the ability to score in bursts. So, I'll prove my skills in the next game.’]

My aspirations revealed in the interview became an article.

Many people were puzzled by my interview.

Who provoked me?

And who said a player with 21 league goals and 19 assists lacked the ability to score in bursts?

There was a lot of interest in that.

And the culprit was revealed.

- Ternana, you bastards!

- Isn't the current top scorer Alfredo? Did he or his fan say that to keep Minho in check since he's only 2 goals behind?

- Stupid Ternana guys! Saying that will only make Minho more obsessed with scoring! Bastards!

The person who posted that was a Ternana fan.

I understood.

Their league top scorer was a Ternana player.

I was in 2nd place, 2 goals behind.

But why am I getting so much flak?

My friend is really happy, though.

- RealMilan: Thank you! Ternana!

- RealMilan: Minho's first hat trick target was Cremonese, not Inter!

- RealMilan: It's such a pity! Inter could have been the legendary victim... We were too kind and yielded to Cremonese!

Unlike Hyerin, an Inter die-hard fan, the fans of our next opponent, Cremonese, were in total despair.

- Damn... We became the target of that monster!

- Damn you, Ternana... Why did you provoke the monster right before we face him?

- Minho! We did nothing wrong! Please score against another team! We didn't say anything!

- Damn Ternana, just wait. We'll get our revenge.

Am I that scary?

I have more confidence in my skills now.

But I don't think I'm exceptionally good.

I mean, just looking at MiTube, there are countless highlights of players better than me.

Honestly, I can't be complacent.

More than that, Lewandowski is truly amazing.

He's exceptional in the air.

His goal-scoring ability is consistent.

Work rate, technique, decision-making, vision.

He lacks nothing.

The term "Complete Forward" fits him perfectly.

That's Lewandowski.

Even watching his videos, I kept gasping in awe.

Especially the video of him scoring 5 goals in 9 minutes caught my eye.

Seriously, he's not human.

How could such a player not have a Ballon d'Or?

His performance last season was also phenomenal.

Well, given the situation, some say he might win the Ballon d'Or that was canceled in 2020.

I agree with that.

A player like him should win the Ballon d'Or.

Who else could deserve it?

What? There's a player from Portugal?

“Sure, Quaresma is really good.”

Maybe it's because I've only seen him on MiTube, but to me, the best player from Portugal is Quaresma.

Seriously.

If you watch Quaresma's highlights, he's like a football god.
