## 36. The Ant and the Grasshopper (2)

- Goooooal!

- Minhoooooo! Hat trick! It's a hat trick!

- The score difference widens to 6-2! Minho successfully completes a hat trick at the end of the match!

- Amazing. Now I understand why Arsenal put so much effort into signing Minho!

The last goal scored in the 45th minute of the second half.

With Park Minho's hat trick, Arsenal secured a 6-2 victory over Newcastle.

- The match ends!

- Arsenal secures a big win at home against Newcastle and maintains their top position in the league!

- This season is really different!

Everyone enjoyed Arsenal's victory.

It was an overwhelming win, and even after the match ended, both the Gooners and Arsenal players savored the victory.

There was nothing wrong with that.

This victory was special and overwhelming.

However.

One player sitting on Arsenal's bench couldn't be happy about today's victory.

He quietly sighed as he looked at the Gooners filling Emirates Stadium.

"Craig! Why are you sighing like that?"

"It's nothing."

Craig Martin shook his head.

Beside him, Amani Richards, who scored the opening goal today, was enjoying the victory with a triumphant expression.

‘Lucky guy.’

He couldn't understand how someone like that could step into such a competitive professional world.

"Sigh..."

But soon, Craig Martin had a look of despair and shook his head.

He knew the truth.

He knew better than anyone that in this world, 'talent' is everything, no matter how reckless one might be.

It didn't mean that effort was useless.

But it was true that someone without talent would have a lower efficiency of effort compared to someone overflowing with talent.

Craig Martin felt that fact deeply.

Of course, he was also a player with excellent talent.

If not, there would be no reason for him to be playing at Arsenal.

But even in talent, there are levels.

Craig Martin could confirm that at Arsenal.

He was a young prospect turning 21, while the main players of Arsenal were in their prime, around 25-26 years old, so the difference was inevitable.

Even considering that, the difference was significant.

Anyway, Craig Martin wasn't particularly upset about the difference in talent.

The talents given to people vary, and their magnitude is diverse.

Players with overwhelming talent trained as much as he did, and there was no way he could keep up with that.

So he could understand the difference in talent.

He didn't think it was particularly unfair.

He had seen with his own eyes how those talented players worked as hard as, or harder than, he did in training.

Craig Martin wasn't foolish enough to complain after seeing that.

However.

His thoughts had recently changed.

To be precise, his thoughts changed while watching Amani Richards.

He began to wonder if effort was a futile action.

That thought came to him the day he first saw Amani Richards.

Amani was clearly like a thunderstorm without anything but dribbling.

He was a player with immense talent.

But honestly, he was a player with nothing else.

A foolish player trapped in arrogance.

That was Craig Martin's first impression of Amani.

After being properly scolded by Park Minho during the preseason, Amani started showing up at the training ground more often.

But Amani's behavior didn't change much.

He still slacked off.

He didn't seem to put much passion into training.

Craig initially thought, 'Would anything change if he continued like that?'

But things did change.

Despite slacking off in training.

Leaving work earlier than anyone else.

Arriving the latest.

Neglecting self-management.

That was the identity of the player 'Amani Richards.'

Yet, a few days later, Amani Richards showed a completely different side in training.

Craig Martin couldn't understand.

Yes, he felt it then.

- Ah, in the professional world, talent is everything.

- The value of effort is less than I thought.

From the moment he realized those two facts, Craig Martin's turmoil began.

Naturally, his turmoil showed in his performance.

Of course, he didn't neglect his training.

He maintained his focus in matches.

However.

If asked who the most unstable player in Arsenal's defense was, most Gooners would point to Craig Martin, as he was visibly shaken.

And today, watching Amani Richards' opening goal in the match against Newcastle, Craig Martin felt even more lost.

What is effort really?

Is football truly all about talent?

Even after the match ended, Craig Martin couldn't easily fall asleep as the image of Amani Richards' performance in the Newcastle match lingered in his mind.

* * *

There are various types of football players.

Among them, two types are the most contrasting.

The ant and the grasshopper.

Ant-type players are very diligent.

They have sufficient talent and consistently work harder than others to improve themselves.

They survive in the football world for a long time.

They are consistent and continue to develop their skills well into their thirties.

They leave a lasting mark in the football world and retire after a long career.

Some ant-type players may not leave a significant impact and might be underappreciated after retirement.

Still, the players who stay in people's memories for a long time are mostly these 'ant' type players.

On the other hand.

There are grasshopper-type players.

These players are free spirits.

They shine with an immense talent incomparable to other types of players.

If they consistently worked hard, they could become legendary players in football history, but strangely, grasshopper-type players tend to be lazy or overly arrogant.

And their laziness or arrogance is not easily overcome.

They enjoy their talents, live passionately for a short period, and burn out quickly.

Their football careers are like fireworks.

Blazing brightly and then turning to ash.

Just like the story of the ant and the grasshopper.

They are truly contrasting types of players.

And now, at Arsenal, these two contrasting types of players were training together.

Slacking off.

Amani Richards, dragging his feet like a squid on land, glanced at the coach's eyes and slowed down.

But the coach, sharp as a ghost, forced him to pick up the pace and complete the final lap.

Amani was indeed like a grasshopper.

He was undoubtedly a player with dazzling talent.

Especially, his dribbling ability was so destructively straightforward that it was rare in world football history.

I guarantee that even the greatest legends would allow him a breakthrough at least once.

That's how overwhelming Amani's talent was.

Yet, he slacked off in training and looked for the easy way out.

Meanwhile, Santiago at Parma was much more diligent and earnest than Amani.

At least he focused properly during training.

Anyway.

If Amani was a grasshopper-type player, then Craig Martin, who was sweating profusely, was an ant-type player.

A player with excellent talent, consistency, and diligence.

The type of player loved by coaches the most.

Craig Martin, who didn't get intoxicated by his talent and focused on his growth, was leaving a positive impression on Arsenal players.

He still had many areas to improve.

But his diligence and consistency would eventually lead him to blossom as a defender named Craig Martin.

"But... he seems out of it lately."

I could roughly understand.

There were friends like that in high school too.

Friends who compared their talent with others and crawled into a pit of self-doubt.

Craig Martin must be comparing himself with someone and having complex thoughts.

And judging by Craig's gaze, I could tell exactly who that someone was.

"Comparing himself with a grasshopper-type guy like that."

Ants can't understand grasshoppers.

Grasshoppers can't understand ants.

I had recently felt that Craig's play seemed a bit off, and now I knew why.

I wanted to give him some advice.

But I felt it would be unclear since I couldn't empathize with Craig if I spoke.

The best way would be for him to resolve it himself.

But that seemed difficult, so I had many concerns.

When I asked Monica, she gave me an unexpectedly good answer that left me impressed.

- Maybe keeping him busy so he doesn't have idle thoughts would be good?

As expected.

My woman is different.

Monica is a genius.

Keeping him busy so he doesn't have idle thoughts.

Isn't that the best method?

Today, I felt like I learned something from Monica again.

* * *

Craig Martin felt something was off.

Today, Park Minho seemed to be following him around unusually closely during training.

Moreover, the training intensity felt higher.

It wasn't to the point of overexertion, but it felt like he was being pushed to the edge, leaving no room for other thoughts.

Of course, it was manageable for Craig Martin.

He always trained this way.

Still, it was undeniably comforting.

"Sigh..."

He wondered if Park Minho had sensed his struggles.

By focusing on training, the troubling thoughts that had been tormenting him seemed to fade.

‘Indeed... A player of a different caliber.’

In the era of Messi and Ronaldo.

As soon as that era ended, evaluations quickly shifted to a three-way battle between Haaland, Mbappe, and Minho.

Craig Martin was deeply impressed by Park Minho's exceptional talent and character.

At the same time, he felt ready to pour his efforts again.

And on October 5th, in the Europa League Group F match against Basel.

Craig Martin showcased an overwhelming performance for the first time since joining Arsenal, leading the team to victory.

The opening goal in the early stages of the match.

He headed in a cross from Park Minho, shaking Basel's net.

That wasn't all.

Craig Martin quickly identified what he could and couldn't do, focusing on those areas while maintaining his defensive concentration.

'Football is a sport played by 11 people.'

Even with a few shortcomings.

The remaining 10 players would cover them, as it was a team sport.

Yes, football was a team sport.

Craig Martin realized that.

At the same time, he let go of his worries about talent and effort.

Instead of wasting time thinking about such things, it was more important to block one more shot from the opponent for the team.

- Craig Martin! He seems to be on fire today! It's like he's leveled up!

- He's running a lot. He's also doing a great job covering for Ricardo Magalhães' lapses.

- Despite being relatively short for a center-back, Craig Martin is consistently thwarting Basel's counter-attacks, rendering them ineffective.

- He reminds me of Cannavaro. He seems to be a similar type of player.

Craig Martin's movements were dynamic.

Like Cannavaro, despite his short stature, he had an excellent jump and a flair for delivering precise clearances.

While he still had many areas to improve compared to the legendary Cannavaro, with consistent effort, he could potentially be compared to Cannavaro in his prime.

Anyway.

Craig Martin's mistakes significantly decreased.

Although a small mistake in the second half almost led to a goal, maintaining concentration for the entire 90 minutes is challenging for even the greatest defenders.

Thankfully, Ramsdale's saves kept the clean sheet, and Craig was named the 'Man of the Match.'

He mentioned the help he received during training in his interview.

- Minho is an amazing player.

- Thanks to his advice, I was able to correct many aspects, especially mentally.

- He is the best player in the world, but he never gets complacent and puts his passion into training.

- I respect him. I'm glad to be able to grow a lot at Arsenal.

It was just to keep him busy so he wouldn't have idle thoughts.

Park Minho mumbled with a bewildered expression as several interview articles painted him as a mentor who changed a player's life.

"I was a great help? Me? I didn't even give any advice?"

He shook his head, thinking something was weird about this team.
