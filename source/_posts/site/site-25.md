## 10. What Does It Mean to Lose? Does Such a Thing Even Exist? (2)

Lorenzo Lupo.

This 21-year-old young striker is leading Pisa as the team's key attacker.

Some might look at the disappointing record of 4 goals in 11 appearances and question whether this player is truly the young striker that Italy is paying attention to.

But if you look at Pisa's secondary pass success rate and the set-piece involvement of the attack line excluding Lorenzo Lupo, you'd praise him as a striker that even Zlatan would envy.

That's how much Pisa relied on Lorenzo Lupo, yet they weren't able to utilize him well.

And of course, that was the case even now.

Lorenzo Lupo was isolated.

All the passes and crosses aimed at him were inaccurate, forcing him to constantly struggle with the opposing defenders and jump high.

Even if he managed to win a header, the probability of beating a well-positioned goalkeeper was very low.

Moreover, the opponent had already scored 3 goals.

The moment the first goal was scored.

The game heavily tilted.

As the first half was coming to an end.

The score was heavily against them at 3 to 0.

Lorenzo Lupo was calm.

Because he knew well that Pisa, at its level, could never beat this team.

Halftime arrived after the first half ended.

Entering the locker room, Lorenzo Lupo just quietly shook his head, seeing the coach who looked frustrated and kept urging the players.

* * *

Finally, that charging giant scored a goal.

Of course, it happened in the 41st minute of the second half.

Since we had already scored 4 goals, it was easier to think that the possibility of a comeback was slim.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The game ended.

My record for today's match was 1 goal and 1 assist.

Overall, it felt like a smooth match.

We dominated the game as if we were never swayed by Pisa at the beginning of the first half.

In the end, we secured the victory.

"Hey."

Right after the game ended, Lorenzo Lupo came to me holding his uniform.

"Want to swap jerseys?"

"Yeah."

"Here."

The uniform is bigger than I thought.

"You played really well."

"Yeah, you too."

He's a more reserved guy than I expected.

But does he want something?

His eyes look like those of a golden retriever.

"Which league do you like the most?"

"What do you mean?"

Suddenly, he's talking about leagues?

This guy's conversation feels oddly out of sync.

Lorenzo rubbed his chin and muttered to himself.

"Serie A? Or EPL?"

Now I roughly understand what he's getting at.

He's asking which league I'll go to next when I transfer?

Is he trying to avoid the league I'm going to?

Or does he have another purpose?

Hmm... I do want to experience another league.

The league that attracts me the most is definitely the EPL.

I speak some English in addition to Italian.

I won't have any trouble adapting.

When I conveyed my thoughts, Lorenzo nodded vigorously as if he had received a clear answer and left.

Why did he ask that?

I don't understand.

At that moment, Santiago called me from afar.

"Minho! Hurry up! You're the MVP!"

Am I Man of the Match again?

I saw a reporter waiting for me from a distance.

Thinking about how news about me would be quietly reported to Korea after today's game made me feel strangely good.

A strangely exhilarating feeling.

No matter how scared I am, it's impossible to stop feeling overly proud after continuing an unbeaten streak for 12 matches.

Looking at the expressions of some Parma players watching me do the interview with the reporter, I could tell.

These guys were truly intoxicated with victory.

At the same time, I was oddly worried.

If this atmosphere continues and we lose once, will Parma be able to overcome that defeat?

And will they be able to rise again?

I don't know.

I've been a pro for just over three months, so there's no way I can predict that.

I just.

If I work hard, things will work out somehow.

Yeah, if a football player is good at football, that's all that matters.

Isn't that right?

* * *

After securing a victory in our first match in November, we continued to show good performances back-to-back.

We won 3 to 0 against Alessandria.

We won 6 to 0 against Frosinone, continuing our unbeaten streak until mid-November.

Some media cautiously started predicting that Parma might achieve an unbeaten championship this season and get promoted.

Other media crazily praised Parma, saying it might be the team most likely to show a giant killing in the Coppa Italia.

Because of this, some players were seriously considering visiting a proctologist.

Oh, of course, that's a joke.

Our opponent for the third round of the Coppa Italia was decided.

If we win against Ascoli in the second round, our next opponent is 'AS Roma.'

Yeah.

It's 'José Mourinho,' the familiar coach known as 'Father Mourinho' in Korea, who has lifted many trophies with several big clubs in the past.

Of course, since the third round of the Coppa Italia is still far off, we didn't need to be conscious of it.

But our boss Alain Lavin, who was in the final stages of his 'first-rate coach syndrome,' was already aware of Coach Mourinho and often worked late.

Seeing him leave later than me, I could tell he was seriously preparing and sharpening his skills.

Our next match is against Cosenza.

Ranked 20th in the league, Cosenza has shown much poorer performance than in our friendly match.

20th in the league.

1 win, 3 draws, 10 losses in 14 matches.

Since they were a good opponent to rest our key players, Coach Alain Lavin rotated the squad fully.

When Assistant Coach Matteo asked, 'What if our unbeaten streak ends?' our great coach Alain Lavin coolly replied.

"A team that can't rotate fully against the 20th in the league has a problem."

And we smoothly won 4 to 0.

I wasn't even on the bench for the match against Cosenza and rested at home, watching the game on TV.

Then I recorded 1 goal and 1 assist in the last match of November against Monza.

I recorded 4 goals and 5 assists in 5 matches in November alone.

We won all the matches.

Since the draw against Brescia on September 21, we had exactly 10 consecutive wins.

Thanks to this, the atmosphere in the squad was completely intoxicated with victory.

Yeah, I can understand that.

I also couldn't stop myself from feeling strangely excited.

But somehow, the players were oddly off.

The atmosphere had become very strange.

Especially young players led by Santiago were the problem.

"What does it mean to lose?"

"Terrifying... So terrifying... Is this a 10-win streak?"

"The word 'lose' cannot exist. Because it hasn't appeared before my eyes yet."

Like something out of high school.

They were acting like kids going through their teenage angst.

When I shared my worries with Buffon.

He replied.

"I'm the original."

It was strange hearing that from the original.

"Am I the original?"

Did I say such disgusting words?

I wasn't that bad.

* * *

As December began, the weather suddenly became cold.

A few days ago, there was even hail.

It definitely feels like we're seeing more frequent weather anomalies.

This past summer, I thought I was going to die from the sweltering heat exceeding 40 degrees, and this time I almost died from being hit by hail.

But now is much better than summer.

Sometimes it drops below zero...

But mostly, it's a mild winter where the temperature hovers around freezing, so it wasn't very cold.

These days, our group chat is filled with serious discussions about how to organize the Christmas party.

Especially Monica was very enthusiastic.

I was happy because it seemed like we'd get to eat delicious food made by Monica this Christmas.

The only person indifferent to the party in this group chat was, of course, Roberto.

[Parma! Park Minho refuses to participate in all friendly A matches. Decision made after talking with Coach Pedro.]

[Parma getting closer to an unbeaten championship! They even refuse to let their key ace play in friendly A matches to maintain performance!]

[Park Minho, carrying Parma with 17 goals and 15 assists this season!]

[9 times Man of the Match! Who is this Park Minho that Parma is so enthusiastic about?]

[Many clubs observing Park Minho! Even a giant from the EPL shows interest!]

Roberto diligently sent me articles and comments from Korea about Parma, appealing to me to play for another year at Parma.

But there was one piece of bad news for Roberto.

-Minho, currently Newcastle, West Ham, Sevilla, and Sampdoria have inquired about your transfer fee with Parma.

-Though these bids feel like a light probe, more concrete and detailed offers might come in January.

-For now, I'll use this to negotiate a renewal or look for better conditions.

-If you have any requests for the club, please contact me by phone or text. I'll do my best to include them in the contract.

It was the news that my market value had significantly increased.

So, I might actually be sold to another club after this season.

But I don't intend to get carried away by the current interest.

I still have a lot to learn.

There's a lot more for me to learn.

Moreover, the next match, the 17th round of Serie B against Ternana, is just around the corner.

"Santiago!"

At my call, the lazy guy flinched and shivered.

"Another 2 hours, right?"

"Ah! Minho! Please! It's already December! Only 3 more matches until Christmas?"

"That's why we need to work harder now."

At my words, the lazy guy pouted but eventually stayed and ran next to me.

More than that, the mental state of the young players, excluding the veterans, had become a mess.

There were no problems until the end of November.

But now that it's December, problems have erupted.

The players' hearts, intoxicated with the sweetness of victory, began to grow arrogant.

In just a few days, the players had changed a lot.

"Having confidence is good."

Confidence that won't lose to anyone.

That's a good feeling.

You don't want to lose even if you want to?

That kind of confidence... yeah, that's good.

The confidence built up from continuous wins brings many changes to a player's play.

But when that turns into arrogance, the story changes.

Confidence turning into arrogance...

That just becomes an insignificant feeling.

We might get a proper scolding soon.

It seems likely that it will happen during the away game against Ternana a few days later.

* * *

Words become reality.

It's a really good saying.

[21st minute of the second half]

<Ternana 2 vs 0 Parma>

The worst match.

Especially the young players, who had recently grown arrogant, finally caused trouble, and the game had completely slipped away.

The two mistakes made by the defense, which was mostly composed of young players, created the current score.

You could see they were completely frozen.

Maybe because nothing had changed after halftime?

Coach Alain Lavin's face had turned purple like a sweet potato, and Assistant Coach Matteo's biceps and triceps twitched excessively, looking like they were craving a sacrifice.

If it hadn't been for Giovanni Buffon, who had channeled his prime and made 6 super saves, the score might have been 5 to 0 instead of 2 to 0.

"When they showed such confidence after easily handling the first round of the Coppa Italia..."

The moment the second goal was conceded.

Lautaro Valentia clenched his fist and criticized the two young defenders.

Giovanni hurriedly covered Lautaro's mouth, but...

The best iron wall, which had allowed only 12 goals in the league, had now become mere scrap iron.

At least the midfield and attack, mostly composed of veterans, didn't waver like the defense.

I thought that was fortunate.

If the veterans had wavered too, we wouldn't even dream of a comeback.

-Minho is pushing forward with the ball!

-For the first time in a while, Parma is starting a counterattack!

-It's fast!

In such a match.

I painfully realized that if I wanted to change the flow, I had to become the crack.

-Minho is facing Bruno!

-Minho is up against Bruno Martella!

After dodging Ternana's Bruno with a sharp change of direction, I broke through to the center.

-Minho! He dodged Bruno!

-It's fast! He changes direction with a scoop turn and digs deeper!

-Minho! Minho! Minho!

Here, a one-two pass.

The ball connected to Franco came back to me.

Here, I dodged one more player with a back shot.

-Minho! Minho! Minooooo!

After confirming the goalkeeper rushing out of the goal, I gently lifted the ball.

A lob shot that went over the goalkeeper's head.

Thud!

-Goooooooooooal! Minooooooooo! An incredible goal!

-Minho broke through 20 meters alone to create a goal! He announces Parma's chase with a goal!

-This makes the score 2 to 1! Parma shows that the game isn't over yet!

Leaving the stunned goalkeeper behind, I picked up the ball and ran back to the center line.

Turning my head, I saw Ternana's players glaring at me and Parma's players with eyes like wild beasts.

Yeah, they must have been planning to pay us back properly for their loss in the first round of the Coppa Italia.

But.

I didn't want to lose either.

‘What does it mean to lose?’

‘Does such a thing even exist?’

I wanted to keep joking like this.

Once spoken, words are hard to take back.

So, to keep my word.

I intend to win this time too.
