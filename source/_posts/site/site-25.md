## 10. What Does It Mean to Lose? Does Such a Thing Even Exist? (2)

Lorenzo Lupo.

This 21-year-old young striker is leading Pisa as the team's key attacker.

Some might question if Lorenzo, with his somewhat disappointing record of 4 goals in 11 appearances, is truly the young striker that Italy is paying attention to.

But if you look at Pisa's second-line pass success rate and the set-piece involvement rate of the attacking squad excluding Lorenzo Lupo, you'd praise him as a striker who could rival Zlatan.

That's how much Pisa relied on Lorenzo Lupo yet failed to utilize him properly.

Of course, the same was true now.

Lorenzo Lupo was isolated.

Every pass or cross aimed at him was inaccurate, forcing him to constantly compete with defenders and jump high.

Even if he managed a header, the chances of beating the well-positioned goalkeeper were very low.

Moreover, the opponent had already scored three goals.

The moment the first goal was scored,

The game heavily tilted.

As the first half was ending,

The score was 3-0, and Pisa was significantly behind.

Lorenzo Lupo remained calm.

He knew very well that Pisa could never beat this team with their current level.

At halftime, Lorenzo Lupo entered the locker room and, seeing the coach silently shaking his head in frustration, just quietly shook his head from side to side.

* * *

In the end, that unstoppable giant scored a goal.

Of course, it was a goal in the 41st minute of the second half.

We had already scored four goals, so the possibility of a comeback was slim.

Beep! Beeeep! Beeeeeep!

The match ended.

My record for today's game was 1 goal and 1 assist.

Overall, it felt like a steady game.

As if the early part of the game where we were dominated by Pisa never happened, we controlled the game.

And eventually, we won.

"Hey."

As soon as the game ended, Lorenzo Lupo came looking for me with his jersey.

"Want to exchange jerseys?"

"Yeah."

"Here."

The jersey is bigger than I thought.

"You played really well."

"Yeah, you too."

He's more stoic than I expected.

But it seems like he wants something?

His eyes look like those of a golden retriever.

"Which league do you like the most?"

"What do you mean by that?"

A league, out of nowhere?

This guy's conversation is quite disjointed.

Lorenzo stroked his chin and muttered to himself.

"Serie A? Or EPL?"

I think I get what he's trying to say now.

So, he's asking which league I'll go to next if I transfer?

Is he trying to avoid the league I'm going to?

Or does he have another purpose?

Hmm... I do want to experience another league.

The league that attracts me the most is definitely the EPL.

I speak a bit of English besides Italian.

So, I wouldn't worry about adapting.

When I conveyed my thoughts, Lorenzo nodded vigorously as if he had found a clear answer and left.

Why did he ask that?

I don't get it.

At that moment, Santiago called me from afar.

"Minho! Come quickly! You're the MVP!"

Man of the Match again?

A reporter was waiting for me from afar.

Thinking about how my news will be modestly reported in Korea after today's game weirdly made me feel good.

A strangely excited feeling.

Even a scaredy-cat like me can't help but get overly proud when continuing an unbeaten streak for 12 games.

Looking at the expressions of some Parma players watching me interview with the reporter, I can tell.

These guys are truly drunk on victory.

At the same time, I was oddly worried.

If this atmosphere continues and gets disrupted once, can Parma overcome that defeat?

And can they rise again?

I don't know.

It's only been a little over three months since I debuted as a pro, so I can't predict that.

Just...

If I work hard, it'll work out somehow.

Yes, as a football player, just playing football well is enough.

Isn't that right?

* * *

We won our first game in November and continued to show good performance.

We won 3-0 against Alessandria.

We continued our unbeaten streak until mid-November with a 6-0 victory against Frosinone.

Some media started cautiously predicting that Parma might record an unbeaten championship this season and get promoted.

Other media praised Parma like crazy, saying they might show the highest probability of giant-killing in the Italian Cup.

Thanks to that, some players seriously considered getting treatment at a proctology clinic.

Ah, of course, it's a joke.

The opponent for the 3rd round of the Italian Cup has been decided.

If we win against Ascoli in the 2nd round, our next opponent is 'AS Roma.'

Right.

In Korea, there's a familiar coach affectionately called 'Father Ma,' who has lifted many trophies with several big clubs in the past, 'Jos√© Mourinho.'

Of course, the 3rd round of the Italian Cup is still a long way off, so there's no need to be aware of it.

But our legendary coach Alain Levagne is already conscious of Coach Mourinho and often works late.

Seeing him leave later than me, I could feel he was really sharpening his skills and preparing.

The next match is against Cosenza.

Cosenza, ranked 20th in the league, is showing much worse performance than they did in our friendly match.

20th in the league.

1 win, 3 draws, and 10 losses in 14 games.

Since it was a good opponent to conserve the stamina of our key players, Coach Alain Levagne went for a full rotation.

Assistant Coach Matteo asked, "What if our unbeaten streak gets broken?"

Our great coach Alain Levagne coolly replied,

"If we can't even rotate fully against the 20th-ranked team, there's a problem."

And with that, we won a clean 4-0 victory.

I watched the game on TV, resting at home, not even on the bench for the match against Cosenza.

And in the last match of November against Monza, I recorded 1 goal and 1 assist.

In November alone, I recorded 4 goals and 5 assists in 5 games.

All wins.

Since the draw against Brescia on September 21st, we have recorded exactly 10 consecutive wins.

Thanks to that, the team atmosphere is completely drunk on victory.

Yes, I can understand that.

I can't help but feel strangely excited too.

But the players seem to have gone a bit off.

The atmosphere has become very strange.

Especially young players led by Santiago were the problem.

"What does it mean to lose?"

"It's scary... So scary... Is this a 10-game winning streak?"

"The word 'lose' cannot exist. Because it hasn't appeared before my eyes yet."

It's like high school.

They're acting like they're going through a stormy adolescence.

When I shared this concern with Buffon,

He replied,

"I'm the original."

It sounds weird when the original says that.

"I'm the original?"

Did I say such disgusting things?

I wasn't that bad.

* * *

December has begun, and the weather has gotten sharply colder.

A few days ago, there was even hail.

It definitely feels like we're seeing more weather anomalies.

This summer, I thought I was going to die suffering from a heatwave over 40 degrees, and now I almost got killed by hail.

Still, I prefer this over the summer.

Sometimes it drops below freezing...

But generally, it's a mild winter with temperatures around the positive range, so it's not that cold.

These days, our group chat is filled with serious discussions about how to organize the Christmas party.

Especially Monica was very enthusiastic.

I was happy thinking I could eat delicious food made by Monica this Christmas.

The only person in the group chat who was indifferent to the party was, of course, Roberto.

[Parma! Park Minho rejects all friendly match call-ups. A decision made after discussing with Coach Pedro.]

[Parma getting closer to an unbeaten championship! Putting effort into maintaining performance by rejecting the key ace's friendly match call-ups!]

[Park Minho, carrying Parma with 17 goals and 15 assists this season!]

[Man of the Match 9 times! Who is this player Park Minho that Parma is so enthusiastic about?]

[Many clubs observing Park Minho! Even EPL giants showing interest!]

These days, Roberto has been diligently sending me articles and comments from Korea about Parma, appealing to me to play for just one more year at Parma.

But there was some bad news for Roberto.

-Minho, currently Newcastle, West Ham, Sevilla, and Sampdoria have inquired about your transfer fee to Parma.

-It feels like a light bid, but in January, they might present a more detailed and concrete amount.

-I'll use this to see if we can negotiate a better contract or find better terms.

-If you have any requests for the club, call or text me. I'll try to include them in the contract.

My value has significantly increased.

It seems I might actually be sold to another club after this season.

But I don't plan to get carried away with the current interest.

I still lack a lot and have much to learn.

Moreover, the next match, the 17th round of Serie B against Ternana, is just around the corner.

"Santiago!"

At my call, the slacker flinched and trembled.

"You have to stay two more hours, right?"

"Ah! Minho! Please! It's December now! Just three more games, and it's Christmas?"

"That's why we need to train harder now."

At my words, the slacker pouted but eventually stayed and ran up next to me.

More than that, the mental state of the young players, excluding the veterans, was in a worse state.

There was no problem until the end of November.

But now, in December, problems have erupted.

The arrogance born from the sweetness of victory began to sprout in the players' hearts.

In just a few days, the players changed a lot.

"Confidence is good."

Confidence to not lose to anyone.

That's a good feeling.

But saying you can't lose even if you want to?

That kind of confidence... well, it's good.

The confidence built from a winning streak brings many changes to a player's play.

But when that confidence turns into arrogance, the story changes.

Confidence turning into arrogance...

It just becomes a meaningless feeling.

I have a feeling we'll get a proper scolding soon.

It seems highly likely that it will happen in the upcoming away game against Ternana, which worries me more.

* * *

Words become reality.

It's such a good saying.

[21st minute of the second half]

<Ternana 2 vs 0 Parma>

The worst game.

Especially the young players, recently caught in arrogance, caused problems, and the game completely slipped away.

Two mistakes from the defense filled with young players created the current score.

They were completely frozen.

Maybe because nothing changed after halftime?

Coach Alain Levagne's face turned as purple as a sweet potato, and Assistant Coach Matteo's biceps and triceps twitched excessively as if they were demanding a sacrifice.

If it weren't for Giovanni Buffon showing six super saves as if he was in his prime, the score could have been 5-0 instead of 2-0.

"In the 1st round of the Italian Cup, they were so confident after an easy win..."

The moment the second goal was conceded,

Lautaro Valentia clenched his fist and criticized the two young defenders.

Giovanni hurriedly covered Lautaro's mouth, but...

The best iron wall that allowed only 12 goals in the league now turned into scrap metal.

Fortunately, the midfield and attack, mostly composed of veterans, didn't waver like the defense.

I thought that was lucky.

If the veterans had wavered, we couldn't even dream of a comeback.

-Minho is dribbling up the field!

-It's been a while since Parma started a counterattack!

-He's fast!

In such a game...

I painfully realized that if I wanted to change the flow, I had to be the crack.

-Minho faces Bruno!

-Minho against Bruno Martella!

After dodging Ternana's Bruno with a sharp change of direction, I broke through to the center.

-Minho dodged Bruno!

-He's fast! With a scoop turn, he changes direction and digs deeper!

-Minho! Minho! Minho!

Here, a 2-on-1 pass.

The ball connected to Franco reached me again.

Here, with a back shot, I dodged one more player.

-Minho! Minho! Minooooo!

After spotting the goalkeeper rushing out of the goal, I lightly lifted the ball.

A lob shot that goes over the goalkeeper's head.

Thud!

-Goooooal! Minhooo! An incredible goal is scored!

-Minho, who dribbled 20 meters alone to create a goal! He scores to signal Parma's chase!

-This makes the score 2-1! Parma signals that the game is not over yet!

Leaving the bewildered goalkeeper behind, I picked up the ball and ran back to the center line.

Turning my head, I saw Ternana's players glaring at me and the Parma players with fierce eyes like predators.

Yeah, they must have intended to repay us properly for losing in the 1st round of the Italian Cup this time.

But...

I didn't want to lose either.

'What does it mean to lose?'

'Does such a thing even exist?'

I wanted to continue making such jokes.

Once you say something, it's hard to take it back.

So, to keep my words,

I'm thinking of winning this time too.
