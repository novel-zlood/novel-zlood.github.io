## 2. Isn't this basic? (2)

I heard from Leo.

The players who participated in this tryout as free agents were once highly sought after by many clubs.

One player used to play for Ajax.

There was even a friend who learned football at Barcelona's La Masia, and another who caught the eye of the famous Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola.

I felt a bit nervous about proving my skills among such players.

Still, I think I managed to surpass that defensive midfielder from Ajax, so that's a relief, right?

Leo did say this stage was meant for me from the start... It's strange to even think about it.

Eleven players faced another eleven.

Both formations were 4-4-2.

I stood in the striker's position.

Well, I say striker, but I thought I could move like a slightly withdrawn forward.

Leo described it as playing like a number 9.5.

Like Totti from AS Roma.

The friend I got to work with was a black friend, and when I asked him how he preferred to move during attacks, he said he couldn't speak Chinese.

For reference, I spoke in Italian.

This friend casually made a racist remark towards me.

He seems to have a rotten personality.

I can't expect much from this striker.

I had no choice but to talk to the wingers on both sides. The friend on the left said he liked to cut inside.

On the other hand, the friend on the right said he enjoyed moving like a classic winger.

I had no idea about the central players.

These friends couldn't speak Italian or English, so we couldn't communicate.

Just.

I'd have to figure it out on my own.

By the time I roughly understood the players' tendencies,

It was time for the test match to begin.

Soon, the referee came in.

Our team, Team A, got the first kick.

*Whistle*

And with that, the referee blew the whistle.

* * *

Team A moved to the flanks while Team B moved to the center.

The attacking flows of both teams in the first half naturally matched their strengths.

However, despite both teams using a 4-4-2 formation, their attack formations differed slightly. Team A used a 4-2-3-1 formation during attacks, utilizing both wingers extensively.

Conversely, Team B used a modified three-back, moving like a 3-4-1-2 to pressure Team A heavily from the center.

Watching the two teams with completely different feels despite the same formation, Leo Carpenter thought,

"So, this is how you can use Mino."

Why did I think Park Minho could only play in the center?

Especially with Park Minho frequently switching with the left winger, he showed a surprisingly formidable performance.

As the left winger fearlessly cut inside, Park Minho widened his position to the flank, creating space in the half-space.

Team A efficiently utilized this space.

The full-back penetrated into that space.

*Boom!*

Naturally, Team A's first shot also came from the half-space.

The same pattern followed.

Park Minho, who received the pass connected from the left winger cutting inside to the outside, dragged the opposing full-back to the outside, allowing the full-back to enter the half-space.

Another shot followed.

*Thud!*

This time, the ball hit the goalpost and went out.

It was clearly a simple pattern.

"But it's a pattern that's hard to counter."

Though simple, its power was tremendous.

B Team's defensive spacing kept getting disrupted.

Moreover, there was a noticeable difference in the level of the wing players.

Team A's left side was superior to Team B's right-side defenders, and B Team's central players couldn't control Park Minho, who actively moved to the flanks.

"This is a new side of him."

He's more active than usual.

Leo, realizing Park Minho's different play, smiled brightly more than anyone else.

Just from that one play, his client's value had increased.

Parma's scout must be deeply contemplating.

They thought he had a clear weakness, but Park Minho on the field showed that with enough time, even that weakness could be filled.

"No matter how inexperienced Mino is as a player..."

He should at least get close to the team's average wage, right?

As if to prove that, Park Minho, who created opportunities by switching positions with the full-back, received the ball in the half-space and curled it in perfectly.

*Splat!*

Of course, his shot shook the net.

So easily too.

* * *

"You bastard! Why didn't you pass to me?"

Team A crushed the first half with a 2-0 lead.

And during halftime.

The black striker from Team A grabbed me by the collar and growled.

"Why are you angry? Thanks to your excellent decoy role, our team scored two clean goals."

"I don't need that. From the second half, you be the decoy! I need goals."

"Sorry, I don't understand Italian well. I don't know what you're saying."

"Damn Chinese bastard."

At my response, the black friend's face turned red.

Oh! That's fascinating.

Ah, enough joking.

If I cross the line further, I'll be no different from him.

"Well, if you insist, I'll feed you the ball in the second half."

"Damn chink... Just don't be surprised when you see my thunderous shot!"

Leaving the grumbling black friend, I approached the flank players I worked with in the first half.

"How were the passes?"

"They were good. Especially when you moved outside to receive the ball, it made it much easier to break through."

The left winger laughed, satisfied.

"Sorry to ask... but could you also send deep passes from the center to the flank in the second half?"

The right winger asked for deep passes into the space behind the flank from the center.

"Could you briefly help with defense when I overlap? My speed is a bit slow."

The full-back friend asked for help with defense.

That might be a bit tough...

Honestly, just playing the first half made me feel like throwing up.

I barely managed to survive the first half by only moving between the flanks and the center.

"I'll do my best to help."

Though I said this, helping with defense might be a bit much.

Honestly, if I played dropping down, I wouldn't last more than 10 minutes into the second half.

That's how poor my stamina is.

Still, I showed the scouts that I'm not just a turtle, so the evaluation shouldn't be bad.

More importantly, I need to feed the black striker friend the ball in the second half.

He's so confident...

If I feed him the ball, will he score about three goals?

Well, I don't like his personality.

But for now, he's part of my team.

Alright, let's feed him the ball properly in the second half.

"Get ready for the second half."

Seeing the players rise at the instructor's call, I also got up.

Let's do well in the second half too.

* * *

"My... shot was definitely... as fast as lightning..."

The "racist black striker" sat on the field with despair written all over his face.

He was quite something.

Despite the perfect passes I fed into open spaces, he didn't score a single goal.

Honestly, this isn't my fault.

Yeah, it's the fault of that friend who couldn't score.

All the "as fast as lightning!" shots he bragged about were blocked by the opposing goalkeeper.

Naturally, the scouts' evaluations wouldn't be good.

Who would look favorably on a striker who missed eight one-on-one chances?

Even I wouldn't use such a striker.

"It's amazing. Was he really a pro?"

Can anyone really become a pro?

As I thought this, the plays of the many geniuses I had seen flashed before my eyes.

"That friend is just unusual."

Yeah, that must be it.

It's not like all pros are good, right?

That black friend probably just wasn't in good condition.

That's what I thought.

The result wasn't bad.

Despite his blunders, thanks to our team's solid defense, the game ended with Team A's 2-1 victory.

And so,

The tryout ended.

Though it was a tryout meant for me, some of the friends who made a strong impression were having brief conversations with a few scouts.

Leo explained that those who were taken would undergo another two weeks of entry tests, and only those who passed would barely join the second team.

"But how about me?"

"Ah! Don't worry about it, Mino. This test was excellent."

"Really?"

It didn't feel like I did that well...

But Leo kept showering me with praise.

He said things like I was the next Kaká.

Or the post-Totti.

Or that Messi was reincarnated in me.

He used all sorts of flattering expressions.

Honestly, I was afraid of getting sued.

Leo asked me,

"By the way, have you decided to sign with me?"

I had promised Leo that I would sign with him if I received offers from at least two professional teams in this test.

But seeing how confident he looked, it seemed like I really got offers from that many teams.

"Looks like two teams made offers."

Leo gave me a peculiar look at my words.

What? Not two teams?

"It's not two teams."

"Then is it three?"

"Hahaha! It seems Mino doesn't know his own value well."

What's my value that he’s acting like this?

Honestly, through this test, I confirmed that I was quite good at football.

But I still thought I was lacking.

"Mino."

"Yes?"

"It's a total of 11 teams."

"Yes?"

"Eleven teams want you. And among them is Juventus."

"What?"

My tongue seemed to fail me.

"Where did you say?"

"Juventus. Hahaha!"

Leo laughed brightly, giving a thumbs-up.

Of course, Leo told me that Juventus didn't make a serious offer.

Of course.

Would they seriously recruit me after just two days?

But the fact that they made an offer meant that my value was higher than expected.

Leo emphasized that point too.

"With this, you now have the title of 'A talent that Juventus tried to recruit.'"

"Does that make a big difference?"

"It means your weekly wage can now be doubled."

Oh, I like that.

Just like how no one dislikes money,

I, too, am someone who doesn't refuse money.

"Then... Shall we start with the agency contract?"

Leo's eyes sparkled.

Like a lion with prey before it.

I carefully reviewed the contract.

I searched for a lawyer familiar with such contracts and asked if there were any loopholes, and surprisingly, it was a contract with many favorable terms for me.

The lawyer explained that a single comma could completely change the contract's content.

And there are many agencies that play such tricks.

Of course, Leo seemed not to play such tricks.

Honestly, to me, the contract looked pretty much the same... The law is too complicated.

After signing the contract and sending it via fax, Leo contacted me within 30 seconds.

"Mino! Thank you for signing with me. I'll deliver good news soon."

He said that and ended the call.

"Good news, huh..."

Well, I don't know about that.

First, I should contact home after a long time.

To say that their son might become a pro.
