## 13. Hat-trick? I'll Do It! (2)

It's noisy.

When I said I would focus on scoring goals, Cremonese's fans were visibly upset.

Some fans didn't like my interview and said all sorts of unpleasant things.

Eventually, things crossed the line.

There were even racist remarks directed at me, which really got my teammates riled up.

Italy is a great country, but...

This aspect is really disappointing.

Just as passionate as they are, they can be equally racist.

"Rwakkeun."

"What does that even mean?"

"It means fiery."

"Oh! Really? Rwakkeun? Roakkeun? That's how you say 'fiery' in Korean?"

"Yeah, Rwakkeun."

"Rwakkeun!"

"Good. Your pronunciation is like a native Korean."

At my compliment, Santiago gave a goofy smile.

Lately, our slacker has been training really hard.

I heard he's doing it to get back at Cremonese fans who made racist remarks about me.

I was a bit touched.

[Cremonese! 6 points behind league 2nd place Benevento! Still a chance for promotion!]

[7 teams fighting fiercely for the 2nd spot, excluding the solid 1st place Parma!]

[League's top scorer 'Cremonese' vs. League's 21-goal scorer 'Park Minho' - team and individual scoring battle!]

[Can Mino deliver on his bold claim and score multiple goals against Cremonese?]

[Mino! Confidently stated he would unleash a tornado shot against Cremonese!]

[Asian player claims he will score with his butt against Cremonese, causing a stir?]

[Is Mino actually an alien?]

After the morning training, during a short break.

After having lunch.

While resting, I browsed through the news articles.

There were some accurate articles, but...

The more I scrolled, the more I saw all sorts of fake news just to grab attention.

Is this why Monica hates The Sun so much?

I think I understand.

Of course, some of those media outlets will delete the articles after receiving the lawsuit from Leo.

Honestly, the photo of me photoshopped as an alien was so ambiguous that I decided to let it be.

-Monica: You look cute even photoshopped as an alien.

-Monica: Mino! Don't you have any other pictures like this?

Because Monica liked it.

Yeah, that's why I'm tolerating it.

If it weren't for that, I would've sued this media outlet too.

-Park Minho: If you send me your swimsuit photo, I'll send you one.

-Monica: You pervert!

Anyway.

Having experienced the despicable behavior of the media firsthand, I could understand Cremonese's rough interview.

In the interview, it sounded like they were going to break my leg.

Honestly, how many players would say such things without a filter in front of a journalist?

Probably not many.

They must have just said they would defend fiercely.

And the journalists interpreted it as they wished.

But what if the interview wasn't false?

That's a bit scary.

Yeah.

Let's trust people.

Didn't that famous entrepreneur say it?

People are the future.

But there's something strange in one article.

What's this?

[Santiago: 'Mino is the god of football! I'm sure he will score like crazy against Cremonese!']

Now I understand.

"......"

That slacker provoked them.

And I became the target.

People are the future?

Trusting people is making me feel like my leg will get broken.

"Santiago!"

When I shouted loudly, that slacker quickly ran away, realizing his mistake.

How can a teammate do this to me?

Maybe he's not actually an idiot but a genius?

* * *

Serie B, Round 22.

Away match against Cremonese.

"Rwakkeun!"

"Rwakkeun!"

Strange sounds were coming out from the locker room.

The word I jokingly taught Santiago had now become a huge wave engulfing the team.

Honestly, I felt a bit sorry.

It's just a meme from sports journalists in Korea who often make typos...

These guys actually think it's a real word.

So I kept my mouth shut.

I didn't want to point it out and make them feel embarrassed.

Although we're all saying "Rwakkeun" among ourselves...

The loud cheers from the home fans, echoing all the way to the away locker room, were shaking the stadium.

Maybe that's why they're acting like this.

They don't want to be overwhelmed by the opponent's momentum.

I left the locker room and headed down the hallway towards the field for the kickoff.

I saw the Cremonese players standing next to us.

Their eyes weren't particularly sharp.

I expected murderous looks.

But the atmosphere wasn't as bad as I thought.

As I looked ahead calmly,

Santiago, standing behind me, tapped my back and asked,

"Aren't you nervous?"

"I'm not meeting Messi, so why should I be nervous?"

"You're really fearless."

Santiago kept admiring me like it was something amazing.

But I think Santiago is more amazing.

Even after being scolded by the coach, he can't give up soda. I think he's more tenacious than me.

But recently, he's reduced his intake to one can every two days, so I wonder if I should praise him.

"You may enter."

At the club official's words, both our team and Cremonese entered the field at a moderate pace.

Waaaaaaaah!

A huge cheer erupted.

I moved as usual.

And as I headed to my position, I heard boos.

Booooooo!

Damn Asian! Die!

What's that? You said you'd score against us?

You're still 10 years too early!

Judging by how the boos reached the center circle, it seemed like the Cremonese stands were packed.

Even without looking, I could tell from the cheers.

In today's match, I was positioned at the forefront again.

Gennaro Tatis was out due to accumulated yellow cards.

Gianluca had a slight back injury.

I heard he got hurt while moving something heavy.

In the second line, we had Santiago-Franco-Denis.

Our best lineup was out.

Actually, with Jan Karamo transferring to Fiorentina yesterday, a young player who just turned 18 joined the first team, so we had no choice but to use this second line combination.

Given the atmosphere, how could we field a young player?

Die, you Chinese! Damn virus!

Booooooo!

Japanese! Chinese! Vietnamese!

Come on, you know Japan.

You know China, and you know Vietnam.

But you don't know Korea?

This is a bit insulting, you know?

We're the VTS holders.

Without VTS, you're nothing!

Die, damn Asian!

Suddenly hitting with facts?

I'm so insulted I want to score a hat-trick.

Really.

* * *

As I said earlier.

Racism in Italy is quite severe.

It's so bad that you can see people with the same skin color belittling each other based on hair color.

Honestly, to me, they all look like the same white folks.

But they say no.

It's quite strange.

So, even though I have good feelings about Italy, I couldn't recommend it to others.

Because if they experience racism, it'd be sad.

Honestly, there's not a single Korean friend in our group chat who hasn't faced racist remarks.

But today, it's mild.

This is quite gentlemanly.

From the fact that they didn't call me 'Ching' or 'Chong,' the opponent is quite gentlemanly.

So I'm also moving gentlemanly.

"Block him!"

"He's through again!"

As soon as the ball touched my foot, I took a shot.

Of course, this shot went slightly high and flew straight to the goalkeeper.

The Cremonese home fans, who had been booing, were now showing all sorts of anxious reactions.

This is quite thrilling to watch.

-Mino! Already breaking through twice and shaking up Cremonese's defense!

-Really threatening movements. His central penetration is very sharp.

-Cremonese! You need to stay focused. The opponent is a monster with 21 league goals!

Maybe because the opponent was sitting deep,

It was tricky to penetrate.

They were definitely wary of me at the forefront.

I was trying to shake up their well-organized defense, but it wasn't easy to find a good angle.

"Just one goal and they'll crumble..."

It's definitely not easy.

Moreover, their play was quite rough, perhaps influenced by the boos from the home fans.

It's only been a little over 5 minutes,

But Santiago and I already had green grass stains all over our faces and uniforms.

I even had some on my face.

I licked it slightly, and it tasted a bit bitter.

"Crazy bastard."

The contemptuous look from the opponent was a bonus.

Come on, hasn't everyone tasted grass at least once in their life?

My uncle even ate a whole plate of grass at university.

So, it's fair for me to taste a bit of grass juice, right?

Don't you think?

But the opposing defender looked at me as if I were insane.

Why doesn't anyone understand?

Sigh! So lonely!

What do you do when you're lonely?

You break through.

Tuk!

As I came down to receive the ball, a pass came right to me.

That's why a forward has to be diligent.

As soon as the ball touched my foot, I pushed forward.

I could see the opponent panicking.

My hold-up play is stronger than they expected.

-Mino breaks through, winning the physical battle!

-Nicolo seems flustered as Mino pushes through. He's hastily grabbing Mino's jersey!

Before falling, I connected the ball to the side.

Santiago received it and sprinted down the flank.

I quickly got up and ran towards the center.

I felt a bit late.

So maybe that's why my marker was more focused on the other two players penetrating the center.

Should I take a long shot?

I raised my hand.

The space in front of me was open.

Our slackers, sensing an assist opportunity, sent a sharp pass to the center.

The ball rolled towards me.

Seeing the Cremonese players in panic, I smirked.

First, let's get the opening goal.

Thump!

Swoosh!

-Goal!

-Mino's long-range shot scores! No one was marking him!

-They were too focused on the other players' movements, leaving a large space in front of Mino!

Swoosh!

I slid on my knees towards the away fans and raised one finger.

Waaaaaaaah!

Mino! Mino! Park Mino!

It's always Mino! It's really only Mino!

Finally, the away fans' cheers resounded loudly.

Conversely, the Cremonese home fans looked as dejected as a 7-year-old scolded by a librarian.

But... what should I do?

This is just the beginning.

* * *

The opening goal came in the 7th minute of the first half.

After scoring that, the boos intensified.

Whenever I touched the ball, they booed.

If I score another goal, they might even storm the field.

If I score a hat-trick, they'll set off flares.

If I score 4 goals, lighters will fly at me.

If I score 5 goals, they'll leave the stands crying?

I'm really curious, though.

More than that, after the opening goal, the game started to flow smoothly.

As I said before, once we score one goal, the opponent seems to crumble.

They really looked like they were falling apart.

The opponent's defense was in disarray.

-They're too shaky! Cremonese!

-They need to regain focus! They're too unsettled!

We already have strong offensive power.

Now, with the momentum on our side,

The opponent must be feeling terrible.

More than that, Lewandowski was truly amazing.

How did he score 5 goals in 9 minutes?

After scoring the opening goal, I've had no chances for the past 10 minutes.

I mean, the guys are just hammering away on their own?

-Santiago's sharp cross! And Franco's header! Ah! Marco the goalkeeper with a fantastic save! That was really close!

There are games like this.

Where you feel good,

But for some reason, the ball doesn't come to you well.

Today's game felt like that.

In that case, there's only one solution.

A simple one.

"I need to run more."

Yeah, if the brain fails, the body suffers.

There's no other way.

I really want to score a lot today.

As I ran around searching for space, the Cremonese defense became even more confused.

-Denis's through pass! To Mino!

-Mino! Mino! Receives the ball and passes to Franco! And a return pass! Mino has the ball again! He's going for it!

-He dribbles past one more player! Mino! He's fast!

Swoosh!

-Mino! Multi-goal! A fantastic goal! That was perfect harmony from Parma!

-Cremonese's defense is in shambles. They're really shaken.

-Coach Alberto Peccia is urgently trying to rally the players, but... it seems like the players are mentally feeling some pressure.

-This is really not good.

Finally, I scored.

The second goal came in the 20th minute of the first half.

I ran like crazy just to score another goal.

Still, I'm a bit happy.

I've already scored 2 goals.

But it's not over yet.

We continued to press and exploited Cremonese's gaps before they could regain their composure.

Santiago's form today is extraordinary.

Thanks to that, the opponent's right side was obliterated.

The right winger couldn't advance properly, making him frustrated to death.

Thanks to that, I'm happy.

-Santiago's cross! The ball goes to the center! Mino! Mino!

Look at this cross.

It's big and beautiful.

It flew perfectly to my position.

I was confident I could make the home fans cry by scoring a hat-trick, or even 5 goals.

-Mino! Going for an overhead kick! Ah! Goal! Mino with a stunning shot scores! Mino! Records his first hat-trick as a pro!

The third goal came in the 35th minute of the first half.

I finally recorded my first professional hat-trick.

As soon as I saw my record, Santiago ran over with a bright smile to share the joy.

"Mino! That was really 'Rwakkeun'!"

"Yeah! Rwakkeun!"

"Rwakkeun! Rwakkeun! Rwakkeun!"

Grown men saying 'Rwakkeun'.

It's a bit scary.

* * *

3 goals in the first half.

And 2 more in the second half.

The moment I scored my fifth goal in the 33rd minute of the second half,

I could really see young fans leaving the stadium in tears.

The flares had already been lit.

Lighters and trash were flying.

Really.

They did everything they could.

And I saw everything there was to see.

So maybe that's why I felt a bit calm.

Soon, the scoreboard showing 5 to 0 stopped.

It meant the game was over.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

Even before the game ended, fans had already started leaving, but the remaining half of the audience was truly expressing their rage and going wild.

Some even shouted they would kill us.

When Coach Matteo glared at them, they shut their mouths.

As expected, the monster who lifts 3 times his body weight!

[Mino's Miracle Show! Records his first hat-trick and his highest goals in a single game!]

[Shocking result! Cremonese's panic!]

[Season's first big defeat! Cremonese club officials to refund tickets to fans hurt by the shocking loss.]

[Mino reaches 30 goals this season!]

[Mino! Alberto's hat-trick leaves the top scorer spot for the next game!]

[Comments]

-So who said Mino can't score in bursts? Damn community post made Mino angry and he exploded against us!

-Who else? Damn Ternana guys.

-Damn it. We got caught up in this mess because of them.

-Damn Ternana bastards! And some stupid racists provoked Mino and made him explode even more!

-Damn them! I heard it too! Why provoke Mino and make him angry?

After quickly showering, I rushed out of the stadium.

Sitting on the bus, reading the articles, I could feel the anger from Cremonese fans in the comments.

Fortunately, their anger wasn't directed at me but at Ternana.

Some fans even cursed the hardcore fans who made racist remarks to me during the game.

Anyway.

Leaving the away match, this was the first time we left quickly before things could fly at the bus.

And soon after the game ended,

Our die-hard Inter fan took over the chatroom.

-RealMilan: Wow! This is Park Minho? He's a complete football god!

-RealMilan: Thank you, Cremonese! Thanks to you, Inter escaped being the victim of a record!

-RealMilan: Now Minho will return to the second line, right?

-RealMilan: It's a pity. We wanted to see Minho's hat-trick in person... We have to be patient.

That seems too smug.

The expression for this is 'King-receiving.' It's really annoying.

I suddenly wanted to tease him.

-Park Minho: What are you talking about? I'll keep playing forward until the Inter match?

-RealMilan: ?

-Park Minho: Our Hyerin wants to see it that much... How can I go back to the second line?

-RealMilan: No... there's no need for that.

-Park Minho: No, don't be modest! I'll make sure to run like a dog and score a hat-trick against Inter!

Three minutes after my reply,

The die-hard Inter fan let out a short sigh.

-RealMilan: Damn.

-MilanoLove: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-KingUve: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-Roberto: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-Monica: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Feeling satisfied, I closed my eyes.

I think I'll finally get a good night's sleep.

Only then did I feel the fatigue, and soon I fell asleep on the bus.
