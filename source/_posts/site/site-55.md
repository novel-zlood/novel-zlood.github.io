## 20. The New Season (1)

Amazing.

Really amazing.

He chases after the pass I send like a ghost and shoots it directly.

What’s truly amazing is his overwhelming ability to convert every shot into a goal.

“His movement is one thing, but that monstrous goal-scoring ability seems to be his real weapon.”

“He’s not a modern striker.”

“But he seems to have good stamina. Considering he doesn’t slow down even after running like a dog.”

As others mentioned, he's a type of striker with obvious weaknesses to survive in modern football.

But I was convinced.

I think I can record many assists this season, just like last year.

However, excluding me, is there no one in our attacking line who can be called a 'technician'?

Kenneth isn’t either, and Gennaro is quite rough too.

This guy is also very rough, except for his goal-scoring ability.

Still, I liked him.

Anyway, to compete in the Europa League this season, we needed the contributions of backup players.

With someone like Yoan, I think he can seamlessly move between being a starter and a backup.

After morning training, we had lunch, did some light training in the afternoon, and then went home.

For once, I didn’t do extra training and joined Gianluca in a party to welcome the young players.

Of course, the slacker was the first to arrive at the pub, downing beer.

I was surprised to see that the guy who loves drinking and eating so much came back at his normal weight this preseason.

Thanks to that, I was the only fool who bet 300 euros that Santiago would come back 10kg heavier.

Still, I was somewhat proud that he controlled his habits and prepared well for this season.

More than that, Yoan Bochani, who I practiced with today, looked at me with bright eyes.

There was someone who looked at me with those eyes once.

Lorenzo Lupo, who has now moved to Arsenal.

He gave off a very similar vibe.

Ah, personality-wise, I mean.

When I greeted him lightly, he came and talked about pass timing for ten minutes.

Honestly, it was overwhelming.

Still, I was glad I came, as I could lightly converse with the new teammates.

But.

Why did Monica text me?

Did I forget something?

My back feels oddly chilly.

What is it? What did I forget?

-Monica: Minho! I’m at the airport, where are you?

-Monica: Minho? You said you’d pick me up?

-Monica: Minhooooooooo?

-Monica: Never mind! See you at home :)

Ah.

The chilling sensation down my back.

I instinctively felt I was screwed.

* * *

Before a new season starts, many experts and fans try to predict the season’s flow.

Especially this season, with the World Cup in winter, discussions about the league’s flow were inevitable.

Otherwise, honestly, there wouldn’t be much to watch.

[Atalanta signs Kalde Arunic from AC Milan! Can they achieve decent results this season too?]

[AC Milan! Will they sell Bruno Campos?]

[Lazio shows great interest in Tottenham’s 21-year-old backup striker!]

[This year is different! Juventus prepares for a big signing!]

Even though the preseason had started, the chaotic transfer market news continued.

[Coach Gino Inzaghi, ‘Inter wants to win again this year!’]

[Inter, aiming for three consecutive league titles, now needs the Champions League!]

[Coach Alain Levagne, ‘Parma deserves good results this season!’]

Confident provocations and statements from team officials were also making headlines.

And fans waiting for the season to start spent their time savoring the information spread by journalists.

-This year’s going to be tough, right?

-Half of the starting lineup is gone… The league might be tough.

-But the Coppa Italia is different! I believe in Minho!

-Rossoneri for the championship… Please!

-Inter, let’s go for three consecutive league titles!

-This is the Parma board… Why are there so many Rossoneri and Nerazzurri fans here?

-Why do you think? They all want Minho on their team.

-Damn them!

“Minho! What do you think of this?”

I looked up from browsing the Parma community on my smartphone at Monica’s voice calling me.

“It’s pretty.”

“Really? How is it pretty?”

“Um… It’s a bit brighter.”

“Then how about this one?”

To me, they all looked the same.

But Monica seemed to think differently.

At least she wasn’t angry anymore.

Buying a necklace and a bouquet before coming home seems to have saved my life.

On the way home, I asked my father, and he said he often calmed my mother down like this.

That means my father had these experiences too… How did he marry my mother?

Anyway.

It’s been a long time since I’ve gone shopping.

Today is a day off from training, so I have nothing to do.

Monica suggested we go shopping, so we came to the city.

Honestly, I’m a bit tired.

But I managed to endure it because we bought a new console and some games at a game store in the corner of the ‘Cento Torri’ mall.

She even waited while I picked out games.

I should wait for her shopping too.

“Um… Minho? You’re Minho, right?”

“Yes, would you like an autograph?”

“Yes! It’s really Minho! Aaah!”

I signed a few autographs here and there.

On the way home, I played with some kids at a soccer field and then had a light meal at a restaurant.

Monica seemed very satisfied with the shopping, and after dinner, she happily went to sleep.

Finally, I could take out the console I’d been eagerly anticipating and enjoy the game.

“Ah…”

I mean, I tried to enjoy it.

I never imagined this game would be so terrible.

Thanks to that, I turned off the game after 30 minutes and quietly crawled into bed with Monica.

“Was the game you bought today not good?”

I could only nod sadly at Monica’s question as she woke up.

I really had high expectations for this game.

“Do you want to try another game?”

Another game?

I only bought one game this time.

Looking at Monica with a puzzled expression, I realized something and quietly covered my face with the blanket.

As expected, Monica is an Italian woman.

She usually looks like she doesn’t know anything, but sometimes she comes out so boldly.

Ah, my face is burning.

This Confucian youth feels dizzy.

Confucius!

Please bless this weak Confucian youth.

What? Because it’s Chinese, the blessing is fake?

That’s a bit too much.

* * *

Parma is a good club.

Well, the facilities are the most outdated among Serie A clubs.

And honestly, the finances are bleak.

But the youth coaching staff is quite high-level.

At least the ‘meals’ are as tasty and nutritious as those of other big clubs.

Some players who played in Ligue 1 or Serie A struggled to adapt when they moved to the Premier League.

One reason was the lower quality of meals compared to France or Italy.

Of course, it’s relative.

I’m not saying the Premier League is a mess.

Just imagine eating French or Italian food and then settling in England.

You’ll miss France or Italy.

Anyway.

Today’s meal was also excellent.

I had a light breakfast before morning training and then headed to the training ground.

I noticed a new face.

A guy about my size.

Shaved head and lots of tattoos.

He really looks like he’s killed someone.

“Uh, hi?”

Contrary to his appearance, he spoke gently.

I felt like I’d been tricked.

After talking, I found out he was a striker who joined the team yesterday.

His name is Filippo Asnelli.

He’s Italian.

He made his professional debut in the French 3rd division, La Berrichonne.

I heard our coach raised him directly in the youth system during his time in France.

Things didn’t go well, so he ended up in the French 3rd division.

And our coach called him back to Italy when he became a free agent.

He’s not an immediate asset.

He’s the 6th option in our attacking line.

But despite his tough appearance, he speaks very politely and gently, which feels a bit awkward.

The skinheads I know aren’t like this.

I’m really disappointed.

Soon, other players came into the training ground and saw Filippo.

At first, they were quite scared.

Santiago kept his distance.

Yoan Bochani’s pupils were shaking.

Later, I asked why he covered his body with tattoos.

There was a story behind it.

He had jumped into a burning house to save his younger brother when he was young and got burned all over his body.

He got tattoos to cover the scars.

If you look closely, you can see the burned scars covered by tattoos on his arms and back.

Ah, he’s a guy with a story.

While training, I checked his play style.

He had a unique style like Yoan.

Back-to-back.

His post play was much better than Kenneth’s.

And his link-up play was excellent.

His physicality wasn’t the best.

But he didn’t get pushed around when fighting with Kenneth.

He felt like a resilient target man.

Ah, the rest wasn’t particularly good.

But as a substitute, he was a valuable asset, so the staff had high expectations.

I was really curious where our coach found such players.

I overheard analyst Federico saying, ‘Our coach could have had a great career as a scout,’ so he must have a good eye for players.

“Alright, the friendly match schedule is set.”

“On July 2nd, we play Bologna. On the 7th, Sassuolo. On the 13th, De Graafschap.”

Two Serie A teams and one Dutch 2nd division team. Not a bad lineup.

But that wasn’t all.

“And lastly, on July 19th, we play Ajax.”

The coach’s words made the players’ eyes widen.

The team that reached the Champions League quarterfinals in the 21-22 season and pushed PSG to the brink.

A strong Dutch team known for its excellent youth system and numerous superstars.

That ‘Ajax’ was our last friendly match.

* * *

Bad news came.

Our main goalkeeper, Michele Sepe, was almost certain to transfer to Sassuolo.

Although we quickly signed a decent goalkeeper to avoid major issues,

With two veteran goalkeepers leaving the team at once, there were concerns that our goal might be shaky.

Well, we have to trust the young goalkeeper Juan.

Watching him in training, he seems quite reliable.

He has a beastly sense and can organize the defense quite well.

His ball distribution is a bit lacking.

But that’s a minor flaw.

Anyway.

Our first real match was against ‘Bologna,’ who finished 8th in Serie A last season.

Honestly, I was a bit worried.

Except for four players, everyone on the field was playing together for the first time, and the squad was quite young and inexperienced.

I was worried about poor performance,

But.

-Goal!

-The first goal of the friendly match is scored by Yoan Bochani! Yoan Bochani, back from loan, impresses Coach Alain Levagne with his presence!

It’s not as bad as I thought?

Bologna fielded 1.5 of their main squad.

Our teamwork is much better now.

My role also changed a lot.

The coach asked me to play like a second striker, scoring and linking up.

Well, with Kenneth providing solid pressure and post play up front,

And the poacher Yoan Bochani expertly finishing the passes I deliver,

It would be foolish not to utilize this.

Our attacking prowess is indeed stronger than last season.

Gennaro on the bench feels the tension.

The new attacking line is sharp.

After recording 1 goal and 1 assist in the first half,

In the second half, I played with Filippo Asnelli and Gennaro Tatis.

This combination was also quite interesting.

Filippo, a different type of target man than Kenneth, cleanly headed my cross to Gennaro.

-Goal!

-Gennaro Tatis scores his first goal in today’s match!

-Parma’s attacking line is fierce!

“Isn’t that totally ‘Big Head Xavi’?”

Filippo’s post play was very impressive.

Moreover, his ability to break through despite seeming like he would lose the ball was striking.

This match showed why our coach brought in this gentle skinhead.

Thanks to that, by the 15th minute of the second half,

The score widened to 4-0.

By the 20th minute, I was substituted and came back to the bench, where the slacker was watching our new recruits with a strange expression.

“Why are you looking like that?”

“Just amazed.”

“At what?”

“Our team… Can’t we do it this season too?”

I understood what Santiago meant.

So I quietly nodded.

I didn’t want to be disappointed later by drinking kimchi soup* too early.

But one thing I can say for sure.

We really have potential.

We can truly challenge for the title in any competition.

I shouldn't be doing this.

But I’m really looking forward to the new season.
