## 45. King Henry, King Salah, and God Minho (2)

As Park Minho had predicted, Monica was crying.

Of course, it wasn't because she was sad.

She was moved to tears by seeing Arsenal rise again and Park Minho leading the way.

The funniest part was that despite crying, Monica's hands moved with the precision and consistency of an automated machine.

She had already edited videos from the moment Park Minho surpassed "King Henry's" great record, starting with his first goal of the season to the goals from today's match.

And that wasn't the end.

If he scored just one more goal in the league, he would tie with "King Salah," the player the Kop fans called king, for the most goals in the league.

If he scored two more goals, Park Minho would become the top scorer in the EPL.

And further, he was nearing the record from the past when the EPL had 42 rounds.

She was quickly editing videos about that record as well.

Meanwhile, Monica's eyes kept darting between the monitor and the broadcast screen.

- The match ends!

- Arsenal continues their undefeated streak with a 2-0 victory against Leeds, thanks to Minho's stellar performance, surpassing the great record of their former king, Henry!

The match ended with a 2-0 victory for Arsenal.

At the same time, Monica uploaded the video she had created to commemorate Park Minho breaking Henry's record on social media and various communities, smiling happily.

"They say if Minho cries and then laughs, horns will grow on her butt."

But what could she do?

Lately, she had been so happy it brought her to tears.

The last time Arsenal showed this kind of strength was the 03-04 season.

No Gooner could hold back their tears watching Arsenal's overwhelming performance.

If they didn't shed tears?

Monica was certain.

They either didn't enjoy football much.

Or they were just pretending to be Gooners, "fashion Gooners."

In the group chat, Monica's edited video was posted.

Park Minho's friends saw the video Monica had posted and shouted, "Finally, Monica has gone crazy!"

- Monica: Quickly, click 'like' on this link. You know what happens if you don't, right?

- MilanLove: Boohoo! We want freedom!

- RealMilan: Don't infringe our right to 'like!'

- Roberto: I already clicked 'like.'

- RealMilan: Traitor!

- KingAwesomeJuve: Wow... But the video is really well made! Still, I won't click 'like!'

Monica snickered at the four people's words.

- Monica: Really? You know Arsenal will make it to the Champions League next season, right?

- MilanLove: So what?

- Monica: I'll tell Minho to show Inter, AC Milan, and Juventus hell as punishment for not clicking 'like.'

- KingAwesomeJuve: Boohoo! This is favoritism!

- Monica: If you don't like it, become Minho's girlfriend.

- RealMilan: Monica has changed... What on earth is Arsenal to change a person like this?

- MilanLove: I just clicked 'like.'

- RealMilan: Traitor!

- KingAwesomeJuve: Hehe... I clicked 'like' too!

- RealMilan: ...

- Monica: Only Inter left?

Yes, no one could beat Monica.

A die-hard Inter fan, with tears in his eyes, surrendered.

- RealMilan: As expected! Arsenal's best striker, Park Minho! I even clicked 'like' with my alternate account!

* * *

After the match, when I got home, Monica greeted me wearing Henry's jersey.

"Did you buy that?"

"No, I got it directly from him. It's a match-worn jersey."

Upon closer inspection, I could see it was from his New York Red Bulls days in MLS.

"It's not an Arsenal jersey?"

"How could I wear that? It's framed, and I'd never wear it. Oh! That's also a match-worn jersey! I got it for quite a bit in an auction!"

Monica's expression seemed to say, "Didn't I do well?" which made me chuckle.

Just as Monica was rejoicing, the Arsenal fan community was abuzz with talks about my record.

Moreover, even Arsenal legends were praising me... It felt like the slogan "Park Minho Arsenal Forever!" was getting closer to reality.

[Arsenal Legend Henry Praises Minho!]

[Henry: 'Minho is a sensational player. Arsenal has secured a forward for the next 10 years!']

[Dennis Bergkamp: 'The club records Henry and I set will now be replaced by Minho's records.']

[Ian Wright: 'Whenever I see Minho, I recall various legends. He can be world-class, but no one can replace Minho.']

There were so many people praising me that I was worried my butt would get sore.

Anyway.

We won 2-0 against Leeds.

In the following match against Sheffield United, I recorded 1 goal and 1 assist, leading the team to victory.

Lorenzo's hat-trick was a bonus.

Simultaneously, by scoring 1 goal against Sheffield United, I succeeded in scoring 32 goals in the league.

[Minho! Ties King Salah's Single-Season League Goal Record! Historic Achievement in Sight!]

[Arsenal's Acquisition of Minho is a Masterstroke!]

All EPL football fans congratulated Arsenal.

No matter how jealous or infuriated they were, no football fan would refuse to congratulate a player who achieved a historic record.

Ah, except for one team.

[With just 1 goal left to break the single-season league goal record, Arsenal's next opponent is Tottenham!]

[Will history be made in the North London Derby?]

The rival of the North London Derby.

Tottenham, who are practically Arsenal's nemesis.

The team destined to be the victim of my record.

- Just get injured and stop the record right there!

Only Spurs fans hurled curses at me.

* * *

All sorts of trash flew towards the bus.

Even though it was a short trip to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Arsenal's team bus arrived at the stadium in a near-ruined state.

"Damn it! Why do we have to be treated like this?"

Amani Richards shouted in anger at the cold fury of the Spurs fans, but seeing a video of the Tottenham bus being attacked by Gooners on captain Tyrone Tierney's smartphone, he nodded in satisfaction.

"Next time, when we meet, our Gooners will instill fear in those guys, right? Then I can bear it!"

Thanks to that, the players were able to relieve the tension before the North London Derby.

The hostility was already considerable.

The away locker room was particularly nasty to us.

"Spurs are really nasty."

"Damn bastards."

Listening to some of the players' comments, I thought.

Wouldn't the Tottenham squad think the same when they come to Arsenal for an away game?

Even before stepping onto the field, we could feel the hostility from the Spurs fans, and we calmly received instructions from the coach on how to play the game.

There was nothing special.

Just to show the 14th-placed Tottenham what hell is like and step onto the field.

It was time to show our struggling rival the spicy taste of being first in the league.

As expected, as soon as we stepped onto the field, an enormous amount of boos poured towards the Arsenal squad.

Boooo!

Die! Damn Gooners!

Don't even think about leaving here alive today!

Juan! Make sure to score today!

Even if you lose to other teams, if you lose to the damn Gooners, don't think you'll leave the stadium unharmed today!

Seeing the Spurs fans' faces filled with anger due to the team's slump, I understood...

Well, the 14th place in the league was indeed an unfamiliar position for Tottenham.

"Their players aren't bad either."

"It's the manager."

Lorenzo chuckled at my response.

On the flank, Gabriel Artinelli, who had returned from injury, was eagerly waiting for the game to start with a face full of anticipation.

Since it had been a while since we had a near full-strength squad on the field, there shouldn't be any problems with our performance.

As I predicted, as soon as the referee blew the whistle, Arsenal pressed down on Tottenham from the early stages of the first half.

- Arsenal is very aggressive.

- Of course. Given the special nature of the North London Derby and the fact that if Minho scores in today's game, he will surpass Liverpool's Abraham Salah's record.

That said, Tottenham wasn't a team to just sit back and take it.

As rivals in the North London Derby, Tottenham slowly began to build their attack around Harriet Kane.

To me, it seemed like Tottenham couldn't mount an attack without Harriet Kane.

If Kane were to leave?

I guarantee that Tottenham would suffer an even worse slump than now.

Well, what does that matter to me...

Anyway, seeing him as a forward coming down to midfield to receive the ball and link up play was impressive.

Had he been playing for Manchester United or Manchester City instead of Tottenham, he might have tasted victory once.

Come to think of it, I remember him looking at me with strange eyes during the match at Emirates Stadium.

Maybe he envied the championship trophy I lifted with Parma.

The game was intense.

Why else would it be called the North London Derby?

Thanks to that, from the early stages, Arsenal and Tottenham players were rolling on the grass in midfield.

Whistle!

Of course, the busiest person was the referee.

Blowing the whistle, giving cards, and issuing warnings, he was running the game busily.

Well... I also rolled on the grass quite often.

Knowing that many Gooners wanted me to break Salah's record in today's game, it felt like Tottenham's defense was especially sticking to me.

Their blatant play showed their determination not to allow me to break the record against them.

Thanks to that, I had the bitter experience of tasting grass on my tongue after a long time.

"Isn't this too much?"

At my jest, Tottenham's defender, Vigo Kjaer, shrugged and replied.

"What wouldn't I do if it means going home safely today?"

Damn bastards.

This makes me want to score even more.

- Intense marking continues on Minho.

- For Tottenham, Minho is probably the most feared attacker. Hence, the strong pressure and marking from Tottenham continue.

- The game is surprisingly balanced. You wouldn't think it's a match between first-placed Arsenal and mid-low table Tottenham, given the quality of play from both teams.

- That's the North London Derby for you.

With half of the first half gone.

Tottenham's resistance was stronger than expected, so we couldn't get a proper chance, but finally, Arsenal managed to string together a decent attack.

Running swiftly across the field, dodging Tottenham players one by one, I could hear the home fans booing.

Boooo!

Break his leg!

Well, this was their home, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, so such boos were expected.

That's why I love playing away games.

The boos from home fans sound like a cheer song to me.

- Minho! He swiftly dodges two!

- Tottenham is finally in danger! Minho! He exchanges a 1-2 pass with Gabriel and moves into the danger area!

- Ohhh! A rainbow flick! Minho uses a rainbow flick to dodge Vigo Kjaer!

Three players were swiftly dodged.

Tottenham's defense was greatly shaken.

Although there were still some defenders left, I didn't see it as a problem.

Considering how many defenders had fallen for my upper body feints, the number was tremendous.

I felt my jersey being pulled from behind.

Usually, this would be a good opportunity to draw a penalty, but no matter how much I wanted to break the record, I wasn't a striker who would give up on a shot.

I took the shot.

It was a crucial chance, but the angle was difficult, so I didn't expect much.

However, the ball left my foot and traveled in an unpredictable direction, fooling Tottenham's goalkeeper, Jack Stefan.

Jack Stefan, caught off guard, stretched out his long arm, but the ball had already hit the net.

Thud!

- Goooooooal!

- Minhooooooo! He scores his 33rd league goal, surpassing Abraham Salah's record!

- Minho sets a new record for the most goals in an EPL season!

Booooooo!

As soon as my goal went in, boos poured down.

Whoosh!

Sliding like Henry for a celebration and quickly getting up, I saw some enraged Spurs fans throwing drink bottles at me.

Come to think of it, I remember Harriet Kane doing a similar celebration before.

Whoosh! Thud!

"Take this!"

I shouted as I volleyed a half-full bottle back into the stands.

"It's not over yet! Today, I'll score a hat-trick and break Alan Shearer's record too!"

How dare these Spurs fans throw trash at me.

I'll teach them a lesson on behalf of Monica.
