## 49. New Plan (1)

“If you’re a striker, you should score this!”

“Come ooooon!”

“Minhoooo! Go for the hat-trick!”

Hearing the fans’ cheers after swiftly dodging Pico Lazzari made my steps feel lighter.

Tap-tap!

As I kept dribbling the ball forward, Lazio’s defense panicked and scattered, leaving gaps that Lorenzo didn’t miss.

Tap!

It was natural for my pass to slip through those gaps, and it was only natural that Lazio’s defense couldn’t stop Lorenzo’s return pass to me.

-Minhooo! Minho! Get the ball!

-Shooooooot! Goooooooal!

-Hat-trick! Minho! Minho scores a hat-trick in the Europa League final!

I struck Lorenzo’s pass in a non-stop motion.

The ball shook Lazio’s net.

Without hesitation, I ran towards the fans and pounded the Arsenal emblem.

“Great! It’s 4 to 1 now!”

“Let’s keep it this way! Just like this!”

“Stay focused! The game isn’t over yet!”

Lazio players’ expressions darkened, perhaps sensing the game slipping away.

Although Fabio Immobile tried to motivate his teammates, it seemed many things were favoring us.

As time passed, the situation continued to favor Arsenal.

In such a situation, Fabio rekindled hopes of a comeback with a chase goal.

Thump!

-Gooooal! Lazio scores, making it 4 to 2! Fabio runs back to the half-line with the ball!

-There are 15 minutes left! Including added time, Lazio has about 20 minutes left.

Fabio Immobile’s second goal.

He’s certainly an exceptional player.

Even in unfavorable situations, he consistently scores goals.

But.

Dreaming of a comeback with just 2 goals was insufficient.

Moreover, I couldn’t be satisfied with just 3 goals.

A sharp pass lightly coming up from the midfield.

Lorenzo guarded the ball, and I broke through to score, a simple yet destructive attacking pattern.

As I ran quickly following the ball that hit Lorenzo’s head, I naturally broke through the opponent’s offside trap.

With acceleration, I decided to kick the ball long and run, making Lazio’s goalkeeper James Strakosha rush forward.

There was no problem.

I moved as I always did.

-Minho! He breaks through quickly and chips it over!

-The ball goes over the goalkeeper’s head!

-Gooooooal! Minhooo! He shows an incredible performance with 4 goals and 1 assist in today’s match!

-The god of Arsenal dominates the Europa League! Lazio concedes again, making the score 5 to 2!

A clean chip shot to finish the game.

After scoring, I ran again.

This time, I ran to the broadcast camera and pointed like a magician to where my name and affiliation appeared on the screen.

[Arsenal]

[10, Park Minho]

<FW 180cm 72kg 27 years old>

Will I be called the wizard of the EPL like manager Benitez?

* * *

Beep! Beeep! Beeeeeep!

I waited long.

Honestly, the game was already decided, so we just defended and let the time pass.

Conversely, Lazio tried hard to overturn the 3-goal difference, but the only opportunities they had were Fabio’s two goals.

With the whistle signaling the end of the game, the Rasdan Stadium was filled with the cheers of the Gooners.

Waaaaaah!

Arsenal’s 23-24 season Europa League victory.

How many trophies have we lifted this season?

The Gooners couldn’t help but be delighted.

In addition to qualifying for next season’s Champions League, we won the League Cup, FA Cup, EPL, and Europa League.

There was some regret.

Compared to the Champions League, the Europa League is naturally a less prestigious competition.

But the results of this season were too remarkable to be just a closing chapter for Arsenal's different image from the past.

Yes, it meant that next season was highly anticipated.

Many Gooners rushed onto the field to hug the players.

Naturally, their attention was on Minho, who recorded 4 goals and 1 assist in today’s match.

“Waaah!”

Park Minho, surprised.

And the fans lifting him up high, tossing him in the air.

After being thrown into the air several times, Park Minho seemed to adapt a bit and shouted with open arms.

“Waaah! Arsenal is what team?”

The Gooners shouted loudly in response to that question.

“The best teaaaaam in the world!”

“Waaah! Minho! Minhooo!”

“Do well next season too!”

“Waaah! It’s a mini treble! Arsenal achieved a mini treble!”

“No, it’s a mini quadruple!”

Yes, this incredible season of Arsenal ended with a clean finish of winning the Europa League.

[Arsenal! Europa League Champions! The club’s second Europa League win since 1970!]

[Park Minho makes history! Records 4 goals and 1 assist in the Europa League final!]

[Highly anticipated Arsenal for next season! Will they show an incredible performance in the Champions League as well?]

[Leo Carpentieri, ‘Just renewed the contract. Minho is now the highest-paid player at Arsenal.’]

[Arsenal! Immediately after the Europa League final, they signed a 5-year contract renewal with Park Minho!]

[The god of Arsenal promises an enormous amount of around 8.5 billion KRW per week!]

[Former manager Wenger, ‘Minho is a great player. Congratulations to Minho and Arsenal on their success.’]

-Waaah! For the next 5 years with Minho!

-Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!

-Ooooooooh! Arsenal! Forever!

-How long has it been since a continental cup victory? First time since 1970! Fiiirst! I hope we can lift the Champions League trophy next season!

-Stupid Gooners……. Without Minho, you guys would barely make it to 5th place in the league this season.

-Stupid Man United guys.

-Man United with Ronaldo finishing 5th in the league……. It’s really not funny.

-???: I didn’t come to this club to finish 5th or 6th.

-Honestly, Ronaldo and Minho are on a similar level.

-Don’t compare our Minho with an idiotic striker who vents his anger by smashing phones.

-I think Southampton, with more tradition than Man United, is more suitable for the Champions League.

-I agree.

-Damn Gooners.

The end of Arsenal’s 23-24 season was the conquest of the EPL.

And the next day, in the Champions League final, Liverpool surprised everyone by defeating Real Madrid 2-1, achieving an incredible feat of winning 2 out of the last 3 finals.

[Liverpool Champions League Winners!]

[The club’s 8th Champions League win in history!]

[Disappointing performance by Mbappe! Real Madrid ends the Champions League as runners-up.]

Thus, the season ended.

Park Minho’s record in his EPL debut season.

56 matches, 76 goals, 42 assists.

His overwhelming attacking points made many people think of Messi in his prime, drawing much attention.

Simultaneously, Arsenal’s swift contract renewal with Park Minho right after the Europa League final drew praise.

In a situation where many clubs suffer from a shortage of strikers, having a forward who can score at least 50 goals each season for 5 more years was a huge advantage.

At the same time, the transfer market became bustling.

Within a week of the season ending, many clubs reached out to Arsenal’s players.

Yes, unlike other mega clubs, Arsenal was an active selling team.

Knowing this, many clubs reached out, and the first transfer rumor targeted the right fullback, Kamiya Takehiro.

* * *

After finishing the Europa League final, I returned home and had a well-deserved rest with Monica.

This season was excellent.

I achieved many personal records and showed much improvement compared to my time at Parma. As a team, we won all the competitions we participated in.

Monica was eager to buy a special jersey for next season’s Champions League final, and I received congratulations from my family back in Korea.

Of course, Monica slyly took my phone and scored points with my parents, and we promised to spend a few days together in Korea before the preseason.

Honestly, April was a tough period.

The team was significantly shaken when a few key players were out, which was mentally exhausting.

This is inevitable.

As humans, we can’t help but worry.

But I’m glad we overcame it and achieved good results.

Moreover, the interest from various clubs in Arsenal’s players is intense as soon as the season ends.

Indeed, Arsenal has many young and talented players, which I have to acknowledge.

And the first target was Japan’s right fullback, Kamiya Takehiro.

[Juventus and Atletico Madrid reach out to Kamiya!]

[Kamiya is an excellent fullback who consistently shows above-average performances despite frequent injuries!]

[Juventus offers 68 billion KRW for Kamiya!]

With sufficient finances, there’s no problem if we don’t sell, but our manager didn’t particularly try to keep Kamiya.

Our manager seemed to prefer a physically robust fullback over Kamiya, even if the skill level was a bit lower.

Well……. Both Kamiya and Tierney are somewhat fragile, and there weren’t many matches where both played together.

Moreover, if both were out……. That day was nothing short of a disaster for Arsenal.

We weren’t even hoping for offensive capabilities.

It seemed our manager just wanted a physically strong fullback who could consistently defend.

Well……. Tierney, an offensive fullback, was sufficient, and this season, our main attacking route started from the left side with Tierney.

It was enough to have solid defense on the right side.

The next player targeted by other clubs was Axel Odegaard.

Odegaard, this season, showed outstanding performances, fitting the role of ‘Arsenal’s lubricant’ by moving back and forth between the second and third lines.

Yes, he really worked hard.

Therefore, Arsenal also started contract renewal negotiations with Odegaard after me……

“Why doesn’t Odegaard want to renew his contract?”

“I don’t know either. Maybe something didn’t sit right with him?”

Even others seemed puzzled by Odegaard’s lukewarm response to Arsenal’s contract offer.

Odegaard, who would be a free agent after the 24-25 season, didn’t seem to be in a hurry.

Anyways.

In early June, buzzing with transfer rumors.

I headed to Korea with Monica.

I had to move a bit early to join the World Cup Asia second qualifying round.

Europe was buzzing with Euro 2024.

Thanks to Euro 2024, transfer rumors about Arsenal subsided again.

After arriving in Korea, I spent a few days traveling domestically with my parents and Monica.

My mother was very pleased with me being in a relationship and smiled brightly.

My parents didn’t care much about how much money I made or how crazy I performed in football.

They just worried about whether I could get married and sighed constantly.

Hey, what’s wrong with me?

I’m quite good-looking.

Anyway.

After enjoying my vacation, I headed to Paju on time.

“Oooh! The god of Arsenal!”

“Minho! Long time no see!”

“Wow……. I can’t believe I get to be on the national team with a player like this……. It’s unbelievable.”

The national team seniors and juniors welcomed me warmly.

Junseo hyung looked at me with envious eyes.

Hey……. Be satisfied that you escaped Tottenham.

That place is a complete mess right now?

The atmosphere in the national team wasn’t bad after a long time.

Though the new manager shifted from build-up football to a more direct style……. It had a different flavor compared to Arsenal or possession football.

In the World Cup second qualifying match against Tajikistan at Jeonju World Cup Stadium, I realized the fun of this more direct style of football.

When Baek Seungjae sent a long pass, I would run to it and pass it neatly to Junseo hyung, who would finish it off.

Even though Tajikistan lowered their line, they couldn’t cope with Korea’s long and high football and collapsed.

[Park Minho 1 goal 4 assists! MoM in the match against Tajikistan!]

[The fearsome Shin Junseo-Park Minho duo! Taeguk Warriors crush Tajikistan 6-0!]

-Waaaah! Minhooo!

-Wow! This is why I watch football!

-Whether it’s possession or long balls……. The quality of the game changes with Park Minho!

-Is it true that Jeonju Castle was packed? I heard tourists from China and Japan came to see Park Minho.

-Hey; why did the Chinese and Japanese come to our national team game?

-I dunno

-Chinese and Japanese keep whining in their communities about being jealous of Shin Junseo and Park Minho lol

-lol If they’re so jealous, they should have Shin Junseo, Park Minho in their teams lol

-Proud to have Shin Junseo and Park Minho……. Wow, feeling patriotic!

South Korea’s 6-0 victory.

With a pleasant win in the national team.

Good news from Arsenal came this time.

[Arsenal! Signs ‘Fabian Pavone’ from Parma for 30 billion KRW!]

It was the news of Fabian Pavone’s transfer to Arsenal, who used to manage the right side during my time at Parma.
