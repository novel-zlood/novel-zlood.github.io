## 2. Isn't this basic? (3)

[Congratulations! The pride of Wonjong-dong, Bucheon, Park Minho! Scores 1 goal and 1 assist in his debut match in a friendly for the Italian Serie B!]

"......"

When I contacted my parents, my father told me to wait a moment, and then he sent me a picture along with his text.

In the picture, there was a banner, and all the relatives who could gather were there, smiling brightly.

"Unbelievable."

Why do they do this?

I feel like I'm going to die of embarrassment.

Once this little mishap was over,

I explained to my parents about what had happened recently.

My father, who listened to my story without interruption, said he would support me no matter what I did.

My mother told me to buy her a nice luxury bag later and told me that she understood how hard it must be living abroad.

At the same time, I started tidying up my surroundings.

Of course, I took a leave of absence from college.

Since I didn't have many close friends anyway, I ended my college life by having a few drinks with the few friends I met often.

Roberto, drunk, said, "You must promote Parma to Serie A! No! Win the Serie A title!"

Another guy beside him teased, "Yeah, right. In the winter transfer window, Juventus will take Minho."

Well, Roberto and his friend's heated argument lasted for about 2-3 minutes.

But, why is Roberto so sure about me joining Parma 100%?

I could go somewhere else, couldn't I?

After tidying up my surroundings, I met with Leo.

"I have one piece of good news and one piece of even better news. Which one do you want to hear first?"

"Let's start with the good news."

"The good news is that Juventus offered a higher weekly wage than expected."

"How much are we talking about?"

Leo made a number with his fingers.

Weren't those guys bluffing?

It's more than I thought.

Seeing my puzzled look, Leo smiled broadly.

"To them, it's probably just pocket change."

"So, what's the even better news?"

"Upon hearing that news, Parma panicked and made a counteroffer. Congratulations. You've secured a weekly wage equivalent to the average in Parma."

Oh, that's pretty impressive.

Seeing my surprised expression, Leo chuckled happily.

"If Minho hadn't shown such an amazing performance in the test, it would have been really difficult to get this kind of wage."

"Really?"

"Yes, it was truly like seeing Kaka's reincarnation."

He's really flattering me now.

Seeing my reluctant expression, Leo pulled out a contract.

"My goal is to renegotiate within six months to raise Minho's wages even more and add a buyout clause, aiming for Minho to transfer to an upper-tier team within a year."

Leo's face was brimming with confidence.

"Well, let's do our best."

I answered as I looked over the other contracts.

But none of them were as good as Parma's.

After quickly signing Parma's contract, I shook hands with Leo once again.

"Minho, congratulations. You've finally become a pro."

It was only after hearing Leo's words that I realized I had become a professional.

* * *

"Welcome to Parma."

As I entered the office of Parma Calcio, a rather high-ranking staff member welcomed me.

I heard that he was part of the negotiation team for this deal...

Given that his face was covered in fatigue, it didn't seem like an easy job.

The staff member slowly guided me around the club.

He soon took me to the training ground.

"You know this place well, don't you?"

"Of course. He's a famous person."

"Giovanni. Please take good care of Minho."

"As the captain, it's a given."

Giovanni Buffon smiled broadly.

For someone as great as him to take time for me...

Maybe I'm quite something?

"Nice to meet you, I'm Giovanni Buffon."

"Nice to meet you! I'm Park Minho. If it's hard to pronounce, you can call me 'Minho.' My Italian friends also call me Minho."

"Alright, Minho."

Following Giovanni's guidance around the training ground, I changed into my gear and headed to the main training ground.

There, the first-team players of Parma were waiting.

I also saw the French coach Alain Lavin, who looked like he had a bad temper.

"Welcome. I'm Alain Lavin."

"I'm Minho. I’m sorry for that incident last time."

"Hahaha! Well... It's understandable when watching football. Don't take it too personally."

I remember Alain Lavin's face turning quite red back then.

I feel really bad about it.

After some light small talk,

the training soon began.

The first professional training.

I was really looking forward to it.

Would I see some cutting-edge scientific methods?

Or perhaps some unimaginable intense training?

But no.

Apart from the training being tougher and wearing a strange vest, there was nothing special.

That realization was quite disappointing.

But the training wasn't bad.

During the training, veterans Giovanni and Gianluca approached me, showing interest.

Through conversations with them and other players, I naturally blended into the team.

Of course, I couldn't become close in just one day.

But at least the awkwardness disappeared a lot.

It seemed like a really good team.

"Hey, Yellow Monkey."

Ah, of course, not everyone was nice.

There was also a 90 kg Latin pig.

Santiago, who looked like he was shouting, "I'm from Argentina!" approached me, picking a fight.

Giovanni tried to warn Santiago, but this time, I was quicker.

"Yeah, Argentine sausage."

"What?"

"Oh, you're not cosplaying as a sausage? With a footballer being so fat, I thought you were imitating a sausage with a high pork content."

For a moment, Santiago's face went blank at my words.

Kid.

This is the wit of an army sergeant.

Even a guy who wouldn't survive in the 'Bundesliga' is blabbering.

"If you keep blabbering, I'll grind you to a hamburger steak instead of a sausage. Got it?"

After saying this, he ran away on his own.

I wondered if he was more delicate than I thought since he didn't even say "Just you wait."

Italian guys usually throw punches first.

It seems South Americans are different from Italians.

Anyway,

After finishing the argument with the thoughtless guy, I started the real training.

Since I became a pro, I wanted to have my debut match as soon as possible.

* * *

Coach Alain Lavin carefully observed the players training with a satisfied expression.

"Franco's rehabilitation is going smoothly."

"Honestly, if it weren't for Franco's frequent injuries... we wouldn't need Santiago."

"That's true."

Franco Vázquez.

The attacking midfielder brought in from Sevilla last year was the only hope for Parma Calcio, who finished last in Serie A last season.

With excellent technique and dribbling skills,

wide vision and overwhelming passing ability,

he had everything an attacking midfielder should have.

But he had a big weakness.

He was fragile.

Moreover, at 32 years old this year, he was gradually declining, so a replacement was needed.

"Whew... We signed many players... but I'm still not satisfied."

"Still, we definitely reinforced our attack."

"That's true."

Newly joined Gennaro Tatis and Sergi Bernabe adapted to the team much faster than expected.

Existing forwards Yann Karamoh and Wálid Cheddira were also gradually reaching their potential.

And now, with Minho joining,

he thought that at least the attacking lineup was as strong as any top Serie A team and nodded in agreement.

"What about Santiago?"

"Well... He still hasn't sorted himself out."

"Tsk... A guy with such clear talent..."

"Let's give him some more time. But it seems like he was more focused on training today after seeing Minho join the training."

"That's good news."

He hoped Santiago would get his act together and turned his gaze elsewhere.

"What about Sergi?"

"He feels more comfortable in the third line than the second. And I think Sergi is better in the third line too. Since Minho has joined... I don't think there's a need to push Sergi up."

Coach Alain Lavin and the head coach.

Both of their gazes turned to Park Minho, the latest addition to the team.

"It feels like finding a diamond while walking."

"I feel the same."

He was excellent.

Minho Park was a much better player than what they had confirmed in the short test.

Moreover, the part they thought was his weakness, his stamina, wasn't as bad as they thought.

They thought that if they had delayed a bit more, Juventus might have snatched him away.

Well, they didn't know if Juventus would have offered more than what they did, though.

"He's fast and skilled."

His speed was exceptional.

It was truly surprising that such a player had wide vision and decent passing ability.

"His physicality isn't bad either."

"If his stamina improves a bit more, he could definitely play as a top striker."

"He's a smart player. I'm sure he'll adapt quickly as a top striker."

The more he looked, the more he saw only strengths in Park Minho.

How could a guy like this not be a pro?

Coach Alain Lavin couldn't understand.

"He's 24 years old?"

"Yes, that's what I heard."

"Should we put him in the next game?"

"It wouldn't be bad. As long as Santiago doesn't sort himself out, the attacking midfielder position will be vacant for a while."

"The game against Genoa, right?"

"Yes."

"Alright. Let's check how well he integrates with the team in the practice match first. If he integrates well, let's put him in the match against Genoa."

"Understood."

Coach Alain Lavin nodded as he watched Park Minho training harder than anyone else.

"This season feels really good."

* * *

"Minho! Get ready."

A few days after joining Parma,

I finally got my chance.

I tried to show as much as I could in training since joining the team...

It felt great to see my efforts paying off.

Knowing that the stamina part couldn't improve in a short time, I tried to show other strengths in training, which seemed to have worked.

In the team's practice match,

I was put into the B team right after the first half.

I was paired with Gennaro Tatis, who I had become close with during recent training.

This guy was easier to get along with since he received my passes well.

"Minho, just make 3 goals."

"I'll do my best."

Positioned centrally in the second line, Valentin Mihaila and Dennis Man took their spots next to me.

Both players were starting wingers and were almost certain to start in the season opener, barring any incidents.

But where's Franco?

I heard he was almost done with his rehab...

Honestly, he's so technically skilled that calling him the best technician in Parma wouldn't be an exaggeration.

From what I've seen in training, he looked like he could be called Messi without any shame.

With a player like that in Serie B,

I wondered what kind of player Messi, who was in Barcelona and currently in PSG, really was.

The phrase "God of Football" didn't seem like an exaggeration.

While I was momentarily lost in thought,

the second half of the practice match began.

I started as an attacking midfielder in a 3-3-1-3 formation.

The position I was most familiar with.

Simon Sorf, the defensive midfielder from the A team who I would often face, looked at me with intense eyes.

It seemed like he wanted to destroy me.

"Don't be too nervous. Simon may look fierce, but he's actually a softie."

"That face?"

"Yeah, that expression means he likes you. He's smiling."

I looked at Simon after hearing Gennaro's words.

How is that a smiling face?

Now that I think about it, Simon Sorf did say some friendly things to me...

"He did sit near me during lunch."

But his expression is too fierce.

Beep!

As soon as I finished my thoughts, the coach's whistle blew and the players started moving.

B-team players began passing the ball around.

With many rotational players in the B-team, they weren't that inferior to the A-team.

However, they couldn't easily move the ball forward.

Which meant the ball wasn't coming to me.

So I went down to receive it.

Tap!

My first touch of the match.

I don't know if it's because it's a training match, but the opposing midfielders watching me with a relaxed attitude slightly annoyed me.

Holding the ball leisurely, I quickly dribbled forward.

With a simple dribble, I easily bypassed one midfielder and soon after, with a light feint, bypassed the approaching Simon Sorf.

"Huh?"

"Stop him! Stop him!"

After quickly passing two players,

another defender approached me as I sped up.

But he couldn't stop me.

I was already accelerating.

Not getting farther away.

But not getting closer either.

Maintaining an appropriate distance, the A-team defender lunged in with a sliding tackle.

He probably thought he completely stopped me with this.

But I wasn't alone. Football is a team sport with 11 players moving as one.

Tap!

Lightly pushing the ball back with my heel, Gennaro, who was behind me, took it and advanced towards the center.

"Huh? Huh? Huh!"

Gennaro Tatis, facing a young surprised defender 1-on-1, took a light shot.

Bang!

Thud!

And the ball neatly hit the net.

Gennaro, who scored, ran towards me.

"Minho! That was fantastic! It was like receiving a pass from Zielinski!"

"Uh... Yeah."

Gennaro hugged me excitedly with a thrilled voice.

Honestly, I couldn't understand.

Why was he so happy?

Isn't this basic?

Everyone does this.

Right?
