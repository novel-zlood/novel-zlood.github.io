## 46. A Team That Doesn't Seem to Lose (3)

I can see the Leicester City players startled as I dribble the ball forward.

They seemed even more surprised because I hadn't shown such aggressive dribbling in this match, only distributing passes.

But what could they do?

Tactically, today I had to be the starting point of the counterattack.

Other players had to focus on defense.

The core of the counterattack was the speed of Jul Kaembe and the height of Lorenzo Lupo.

However, if I, the top scorer in the league, just pass the ball around without doing anything... Leicester City players would defend comfortably with happy smiles.

This is bait.

I threw the bait.

Leicester City took it.

"Stop him!"

Seeing me bypass one player in an instant, the Leicester City defense leaned towards my side.

This meant there was space on the opposite side, and the wild horse that would penetrate that wide space was free.

Boom!

As I connected the ball long to the other side, the Leicester City defense was startled and shouted.

"It's the opposite side! Stop him!"

As soon as Jul Kaembe caught the ball, the Leicester City defense moved frantically.

Leicester City was greatly shaken from side to side.

Jul Kaembe did not pass or cross but penetrated into the half space and took a shot.

Boom!

- Wow! Schmeichel with a fantastic save!

- Leicester City survives another crisis! That was a really dangerous moment!

- Although Leicester City seems to have the upper hand in the match, Arsenal is dominating the overall performance.

- They are boldly giving up possession but preventing Leicester City from easily taking shots.

Leicester City was indeed a formidable team.

The fact that they maintained 7th place in the league even as we approached early March spoke volumes about their ability.

Moreover, the veteran James Vardy was consistently doing his part.

This meant that Leicester City deserved to be in the League Cup final.

So, we brought tactics suitable for a team worthy of that qualification.

"You bastards! Stop falling back!"

"Boooo! And you call yourselves an undefeated team!"

"Damn it! Someone please score a goal!"

I could hear the anger from the Leicester City fans.

Looking at the flow of the game... it was strange that Leicester City couldn't score, but oddly enough, it was Arsenal that was creating the better chances.

- The ball is connected to Minho again!

- Arsenal's counterattack begins!

- Leicester City retreats quickly!

As soon as the ball touched my foot, I could see the Leicester City defense tense up.

This time, I dribbled directly, bypassed Jimmy Justin in front of me, and seized a shooting opportunity.

Schmeichel, the goalkeeper, threw himself in panic.

His reflexes were truly surprising.

I thought this shot was really going in.

- Schmeichel blocks Minho's shot! Today, Leicester City is being led by two veterans!

- Except for Vardy and Schmeichel, Leicester City is showing really disappointing performance.

Despite the veterans' efforts, Leicester City was having no fun until the end of the first half.

We also faced crises, and Schmeichel, the goalkeeper, was miraculously blocking my powerful shots.

Thanks to that, the Leicester City fans who were cursing nonstop were gradually regaining their composure and starting to mock.

"Haha! You fools!"

"Minho? That foolish striker who has already had 5 shots blocked can't get past our guardian!"

"Come on! Vardy! Just one goal, and Schmeichel will take care of the rest!"

Hmm... my pride is slightly hurt.

Leicester City fans' shouts slightly upset me.

So, I should repay them properly, right?

How will I repay them?

Of course, by scoring a goal.

A striker speaks with goals.

Isn't that right?

Anyway.

The first half passed in an instant.

The first half ended 0-0 with the referee's whistle.

If you look at the whole game, Leicester City had high possession and played decent football.

If you look at the highlights of the game, you could say that Arsenal calmly led the match.

Coach Rodgers went into the locker room with an excited expression and a torrent of curses, and the Leicester City players followed with expressions of frustration.

On the other hand, Arsenal... was just calm.

They were calmly preparing for the second half, feeling that things went according to their tactics in the first half.

"Good job."

There weren't many words.

Today's match would be decided by just one goal.

The coach and the players thought so.

There was no need to rush.

They even considered extra time if necessary.

Of course, that wouldn't happen.

Because I would definitely score a goal in the second half.

* * *

"Phew..."

The second half began.

Leicester City's Jimmy Justin swallowed hard and looked at Park Minho dribbling up the side.

'Crazy bastard.'

He hadn't scored in today's match, but his effective shots were more than the 17 shots recorded by Leicester City.

This meant that Arsenal's prepared defense was effective and Leicester City's shots were that inaccurate.

At the same time, it meant that despite fewer opportunities, that monster was consistently producing results.

If it weren't for the crazy saves by the core of the defense, Schmeichel, Leicester City would be trailing 2-0 and struggling to break through Arsenal's heavy defense.

'Still, 0-0 now is much better.'

Anyway.

Leicester City was playing a not-bad game and maintaining a 0-0 score into the second half.

Jimmy Justin, who was constantly on guard against Park Minho, took a deep breath.

He couldn't help but be nervous.

How many defenders in the EPL wouldn't be nervous marking the league's top scorer?

'He's coming!'

Finally, just as random thoughts evaporated from his mind like gasoline hitting the ground, Park Minho started to speed up, trying to break through Jimmy Justin.

His pure speed was top-tier in the EPL, but not as overwhelming as Jul Kaembe on the opposite side.

The problem was his overwhelming reflexes and balance that supported that speed.

Tap-! Tap-tap!

With just three touches, Jimmy Justin's body began to wobble.

"Fxxk!"

A curse slipped out involuntarily.

But it wasn't over.

Jimmy Justin, who stumbled and fell to Park Minho's signature step-over, tried to get up and stretch his leg.

As he fell, Louis Tielemans joined in to defend, but Park Minho smoothly evaded their pressure with a McGeady Spin.

- Minho! Minho! A fantastic McGeady Spin!

- He bypasses two players in an instant!

Seeing the Leicester City players' horrified expressions, the fallen Jimmy Justin shouted loudly.

"Stop him! Stop him!"

Park Minho penetrated into Leicester City's danger zone.

Simultaneously, a hole opened in Leicester City's defense.

Lorenzo Lupo naturally moved into the space created by the two defenders being bypassed.

Seeing Lorenzo Lupo pulling a defender and moving to the opposite side, Park Minho kept running without stopping.

Park Minho got closer to the goal.

After smoothly touching the ball to avoid the opponent's tackle, he connected the ball to Lorenzo, who was running on the opposite side.

Seeing Lorenzo lightly trap the ball with his chest, Schmeichel turned his body towards him, but Lorenzo's choice was not a shot but a pass.

Tap!

Park Minho, who penetrated into the open space after a return pass, took a shot.

A very light shot, that is.

Bang!

Thud!

"No!"

"Booooo!"

"You bastards!"

Leicester City fans' screams filled Wembley Stadium as they saw Park Minho's clean finish.

Park Minho smiled brightly, slid across the field, and nodded.

* * *

"You bastards."

James Vardy glared at us with a face full of anger.

Yeah, if you're upset, old man, score one and defend with ten men?

The reason they're angry is obviously because of our ten-man defense.

As soon as my goal went in, Lorenzo and I were taken off, and two midfielders filled the field.

The formation was 4-5-1.

Jul Kaembe, who moved to the front, also actively participated in defense, protecting the one goal I scored.

With the referee's whistle, we were able to lift the League Cup trophy.

Whistle! Whistle! Whistle!

Lifting the trophy after a long time.

Arsenal players had expressions of deep emotion.

Of course, so did the Gooners.

"How long has it been since we won the League Cup?"

"Minho is a god! Minho is a god! Minho is a god!"

"If we win the league undefeated, this season will be greater than the 03-04 season!"

"Hahahahaha! Long live Jade Kroenke!"

"Long live Minho too!"

"This is our first League Cup win since the 92-93 season! Aaaaaaahhhhh!"

As I watched the fans' happiness, the unusually small League Cup trophy appeared.

It felt strangely emotional, knowing that most players never get to win even a small trophy like this in their lifetime.

<The 23-24 season League Cup winner is Arsenal!>

Simultaneously, captain Tyrone Tierney lifted the trophy with a smile.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Confetti filled Wembley Stadium.

This season's League Cup belonged to us, Arsenal.

* * *

[Arsenal wins the League Cup 1-0!]

[First League Cup win in almost 30 years! The last League Cup win was in the 92-93 season!]

[Arsenal wins with Minho's decisive goal! Stifling defense tightly binds Leicester City!]

[Coach Rodgers: 'This is not football!']

[Alain Levagne: 'Ten-man defense isn't football? But this is football too.']

- Wooohoooo! We won! We won!

- Great! Absolutely great! I love the League Cup win and our current league standings!

- We're going for a double or mini-treble this year... and winning the Champions League next year!

- Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!

- Seriously... Minho is an amazing player!

The Gooners were delighted with the League Cup victory.

They couldn't help but be happy.

Apart from the early 90s, Arsenal hadn't won the League Cup for a long time.

The recent victory was the FA Cup win in the 19-20 season, which didn't cause much of a stir in London.

Still, no football fan would dislike a rare victory.

Especially for the Gooners, anything Arsenal achieved was welcome.

"Come to think of it, we haven't lost a game this season."

"We haven't. Mostly wins or draws."

"Just two draws and the rest are wins."

"Wow... we were really crazy."

"And we're still in a situation where we need to keep being crazy."

Despite winning the League Cup, Arsenal's training ground was the same as usual.

The players knew what was more important.

Coach Alain Levagne was willing to forgive lazy players, but he had no mercy for those who slacked off after winning the League Cup.

Of course, such players didn't exist at Arsenal.

Everyone was so focused on the goal of winning the league that there was no complacency.

In the subsequent FA Cup 5th round match against Liverpool.

Both teams fielded backup squads, and Arsenal narrowly won 4-3.

This time, Liverpool scored three goals in the first half, making victory seem certain, but Park Minho, who was substituted in the 15th minute of the second half, led the team to victory with 2 goals and 2 assists.

- It really looked like we were going to lose... but we didn't.

- It's getting scary. Is Arsenal really going to win the league undefeated?

EPL fans began to sense that an undefeated league victory, which hadn't been seen since the 03-04 season, was getting closer as they watched Arsenal, who seemed like they might lose but didn't.

And so, the Europa League Round of 16 first leg approached.

Arsenal was awaited by a trip to Besiktas.
