## 21. A Player Smiling Even When the Team is Losing! (1)

I was stunned.

I couldn’t regain my senses after the goal scored in the first minute of the first half.

“What the...?”

Coach Vittorio Gassman looked at Park Minho, Parma’s ace, with disbelief.

“No way.”

“Yeah, no way.”

“That was just luck.”

He dismissed it.

Yeah, that goal was just a stroke of luck.

That’s how Coach Vittorio Gassman rationalized it.

But.

As time went on, Genoa was completely overwhelmed by Parma’s pressing and lost control of the game.

-Parma! They are fierce! Is this really a team that got promoted this season?

-They are pushing Genoa as if they are one of the top teams in Serie A! Parma! Parma! Pass to Minho here!

-Minho! He’s got the ball!

It was him.

That damn ace of Parma.

After scoring the first goal in the opener, he was quiet for a bit, but then he started making his presence known again in the 15th minute of the first half.

This time, it was an assist.

A low pass that Kenneth connected with a near-perfect header to shake Genoa’s net.

-Gooooooooal! Kenneth Marseticoooo!

Coach Vittorio held his head in his hands.

Only now did he realize.

That the opponent was of a higher caliber than Genoa.

No matter how much luck he thought they had last season with an unbeaten league win and a Coppa Italia victory.

He thought it was a result of some luck.

But it wasn’t.

“Ah...”

Genoa’s central defender, Alice Criscito, collapsed as if hit by a tranquilizer dart.

During that moment, Park Minho made a sharp pass to Kenneth’s feet once again.

Splat!

The score started to widen quickly.

The Parma fans who followed the team to the away game were thrilled to see the score widen to 3-0.

“Mi-noooooo!”

“This is it! This is it!”

“Kennetthhhh! Nice one!”

Coach Vittorio thought.

This is a nightmare.

Yeah, it must be a dream.

But pinching the ball didn’t wake him.

The pain was real.

Just over 20 minutes into the first half.

Parma started leading significantly by 3-0.

* * *

“They’re scarier today.”

The slacker looked at me with a frustrated expression.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”

“I saw it all earlier.”

So, he saw it.

Earlier, while dodging Genoa’s central defender Alice Criscito with a feint, I provoked him with words.

In the end, Alice got so angry that he tackled me roughly in the danger zone, earning himself a yellow card and giving away a penalty kick.

Of course, I gave the PK to Kenneth.

If he scored this, it would be a hat-trick.

Naturally, Kenneth scored powerfully.

Kenneth recorded a hat-trick, and the score widened significantly to 4-0.

The referee blew the whistle to signal the end of the first half.

As we entered the locker room, our coach greeted us with an excited face.

Lately, I’ve noticed.

The person whose hair is gradually disappearing seems to have an increasingly red nose.

“How is it? Serie A is nothing, right?”

All the young players laughed loudly at the coach's question.

Right. It’s nothing.

But we didn’t let our guard down.

The players' eyes were filled with ambition.

“Great! Let’s carry this momentum into the second half and secure a perfect victory. Let’s return to Parma in high spirits.”

There were no other words.

Honestly, the atmosphere was so good, and with a 4-0 lead, the chances of a comeback were slim.

Thanks to that, I quietly peeled a banana and ate it to prepare for the second half.

The slacker was drinking a sports drink but didn’t look too pleased.

Well, during the off-season, he lived on that sweet and fizzy soda, so this bland sports drink wouldn’t suit his taste.

Second half.

Genoa used an early substitution card to try to turn the tide and reverse the 4-goal difference from the first half.

Gallardo Caicedo was taken out, and veteran striker Noe Destro was brought in to try to change the mood.

But it was still far from enough.

Those annoying bastards.

Professor Park’s lecture wasn’t over yet.

-Minho! He drops back to the second line to coordinate the attack. He’s playing a significant role in today’s match.

-Minho, who has recorded 1 goal and 2 assists in today’s game, slowly dribbles up the field.

-Genoa! They need to get their act together! If they leave such gaps between their defensive and midfield lines like in the first half, they will continue to concede goals!

According to the analysis team’s data, Genoa’s strength lies in their tight lines between the defense and midfield.

Strong central pressure that prevents the opponent's second line from making accurate passes.

Since that wasn’t working, Genoa was shaking, worse than a typical club in Serie B.

Swoosh!

A sharp pass that cut through the ground.

Kenneth took a strong shot, and Genoa’s goalkeeper, Gutieri Sarrigu, barely saved it by diving.

-Gutieri Sarrigu’s great save!

But.

They need to know.

A poorly punched-out shot becomes a delicious prey for the opposing striker.

-A second ball a bit far! Minho! Minho has it!

-Minho goes for a shot as is!

-Gooooooooal! Minho scores a multi-goal in today’s game! Parma sinks Genoa completely with a score of 5-0!

The score was now 5-0.

On my way back after finishing the celebration, I glanced at the Genoa players.

As expected, they were dazed.

Seeing them completely lose their will, I quietly cheered them on in my heart.

Genoa, get up!

My lecture isn’t over yet!

* * *

[Parma! Massive victory in the opener! 5-0 Win!]

[Is this a promoted team? Overwhelming Genoa with incredible attacking power!]

[Park Minho scores 2 goals and 2 assists! Showing the same performance in Serie A as in Serie B!]

[Coach Vittorio Gassman, ‘It was the worst match. We apologize to the fans who came to watch today’s game.’]

[Dumb Vittorio OUT! Genoa home fans shout in anger!]

[Sophomore jinx? No such word exists for Park Minho!]

[Comments]

-Park Minho! Park Minho!

-Worship the god of Parma!

-Amazing attacking power. Especially, the chemistry between Minho and Kenneth feels even stronger than last season.

-Yoan, who newly joined the team, also looked quite good. Although he didn’t score today, his movements were great.

The fans who watched Parma’s first match reacted positively.

Of course.

In their first Serie A match after promotion, they achieved a massive 5-0 victory.

Even though it was limited to the first round, Parma climbed to the top of the league with the goal difference.

Some fans even joked about ending the season right then and there.

The good atmosphere continued.

Fans started to wonder if Parma might actually win the league this season.

Some fans thought it was too early and wanted to wait and see more.

But after maintaining good performances until the third round, the typically impatient Italians turned into enthusiastic supporters of Parma.

[Parma, Round 2 ends in a 0-0 draw!]

[Parma thwarted by Torino’s bus parking! But steadily accumulating points!]

[Round 3, 7-0 victory! Minho’s hat-trick!]

[Park Minho records his first Serie A hat-trick! Shocking performance with 5 goals and 2 assists in 3 matches!]

[Minho! Second in Serie A scoring! First place is AS Roma’s Tammy Abraham with 8 goals!]

With 2 wins and 1 draw in the first three rounds, Parma showed a performance uncharacteristic of a promoted team.

Of course, it was uncertain if this momentum could continue.

[Parma’s opponent in Round 4 is Inter!]

In the early period of the league’s fourth round, Parma was set to face last season’s champion, Inter.

[Coach Gino Inzaghi, ‘I’m preparing to face Parma as a title contender.’]

It was Inter, who were still smarting from their defeat in the Coppa Italia last season.

* * *

Coach Gino Inzaghi thought.

Inter now is a team capable of aiming for the Champions League title.

They were just one perfect striker away from being complete.

However.

He couldn’t recruit the player he wanted.

It wasn’t a matter of money.

Nor was it because another team snatched him away.

The player renewed his contract with his current team, staying there for another year.

That part was fortunate.

Although the buyout clause went up significantly with the new contract, it was still considered a bargain.

“Not even 100 million euros... Just 52 million euros?”

Such a cheap price.

That’s why it was even more disappointing.

The player he really wanted was right in front of him.

He had plenty of money.

But he couldn’t bring that player in, which made Coach Gino Inzaghi very sad.

The new season began that way.

The player he was monitoring continued to prove his value with a monstrous performance from the opening match.

He played brilliantly in the following two matches as well.

Now, they were set to face each other in the fourth round.

He wanted to show it.

The value of the team called Inter and the kind of synergy that could be created if that player joined Inter.

So, he made a lot of preparations.

“The opponent is Parma, who embarrassed us in the Coppa Italia last season.”

At Coach Gino Inzaghi’s words, the players’ eyes gleamed fiercely.

Their eyes looked like those of seasoned warriors.

A solemn atmosphere filled the locker room.

Coach Gino Inzaghi watched those seasoned warriors, stoking their competitive spirit.

“We must win. No matter how great a performance Parma is showing, they are a newly promoted team this season, and we are last season’s champions.”

“Fight like champions.”

“Show them clearly who the champions of Serie A are. That’s what I expect from you.”

The timing was perfect.

Just as Coach Gino Inzaghi finished his speech.

The home fans’ chants could be heard in the locker room.

“Nerazzurri! Noi saremo qui!”

“Nerazzurri!”

“Pazzi come te!”

“Nerazzurri!”

The loud cheers of the home fans singing Inter’s anthem.

A strong sense of competitiveness flowed from the players' eyes.

“Combattere!”

“Let’s go! Let’s show those Parma guys who the Serie A champions are!”

“Come oooon!”

There was Italian.

And English.

A bit of French too.

But the meaning was the same.

Coach Gino Inzaghi nodded in satisfaction, watching the players enter the field with the mindset of soldiers going to war.

* * *

It’s Inter.

A tough opponent.

Listening to the interviews, it was clear they had prepared a lot to face us.

But I wasn’t worried.

Just as Inter prepared a lot to face us.

We also put in a lot of effort to gain points against Inter.

“But they are champions...”

They are the champions who dominated Serie A last season.

They have the skills of champions.

Their squad is filled with great pride.

That’s why I was a bit worried.

Whether the new young players who joined the team this year would perform well at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium.

But the young players didn’t look bad.

Farnow and Boston, who became core defenders of Parma in just three matches, were staring intently at a small piece of paper with the habits of Inter’s attackers written on it.

Midfielder Perrelle Canasini, making his first start today, quietly played the Heart Sutra in a language I couldn’t identify on his Chinese-made Walkman, even though he was Italian.

An Italian guy listening to a Korean version of the Heart Sutra made in China—truly confusing.

The slacker, who recently had a somewhat dazed expression, began emptying his mind in the locker room.

He mentioned that emptying his mind this way before entering the field made the game go much smoother.

Tsk tsk tsk...

Back in my day.

We didn’t believe in such superstitions.

Even in the Military League, we didn’t believe in such superstitions.

In the Military League, we only prayed for the number of sergeants playing and the field condition on that day.

In the Military League, the one who ate more army food is Messi, Zlatan, and Ronaldo.

Anyway.

While I was briefly lost in thought, the chants of the Nerazzurri started to reach the locker room.

Alright, it’s time to go out.

It’s Parma, who continued the good atmosphere from the opening match.

It’s still early in the season.

We grabbed the top spot in the league.

Of course, this ranking will likely drop.

But I wanted to stay at the top of the league as long as possible.

I wanted to continue this good atmosphere.

Yes, I wanted to beat Inter today and maintain our top spot in the league.

So, I was determined to win.

“It’s time to enter.”

At the stadium manager’s words, the players slowly stood up and left the locker room.

Serie A League Round 4.

To play against Inter.
