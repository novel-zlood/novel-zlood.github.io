## 23. The Villain Appears (2)

Alright, since I've decided to become a villain...

I resolved to play even more ruthlessly.

- Minho! He swiftly breaks through Rome's flank! His movement is incredibly quick and direct!

- Ferocious! He tears through Rome's flank without hesitation!

As I started to pick up speed with the ball, the boos from the home fans began to grow louder.

Seeing Castos Vigna, who had rushed to stop me, get taken down by a single back shot, someone shouted:

“You villain! Stop knocking down our players!”

The voice was soft.

It seemed to be a child's voice.

Of course, I couldn't check the face.

Because I was facing Rome's central defender, Aiba Cabanes, after getting past fullback Castos Vigna.

“Stop him!”

“Aiba! Please, stop him!”

The home fans' screams grew louder as I quickly tricked Aiba with light footwork.

This is why I love football.

- Minho! Step over!

“Grrrr!”

Aiba Cabanes slipped eventually.

Passing by him, I shot in a direction that Rome's goalkeeper, Joe Patricio, couldn't predict.

Thud—

- Goooooooal!

- Aaaaah! Minhoooooo! He scores the equalizer just 3 minutes after being substituted!

- The god of Parma is different! Truly different! Once again, Minho saves the team from a crisis!

“Aaaaah!”

“That damn guy again!”

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!”

The home fans clutched their heads and screamed.

Since I came in, the score was tied at 2-2, and they realized there was enough time left to turn the game around.

I ran with the ball to the center line.

On my way back, I scanned the stands to find the child who had told me to stop knocking down Rome players.

He looked like he was crying, and it made me sad.

But what can I do?

I have to play for Parma too.

It's only a tie right now, and we need one more goal to win.

And there wasn't much time left.

“Minho!”

Of course, my teammates passed the ball to me.

Isn't this a good example of ‘Do it for us’?

Alright, since they asked for it... I have to do it.

When I received the ball near the center line and started running, the boos from Rome's home fans began again.

It meant they wanted me to stop.

Booooo!

Now, two players were blocking me simultaneously.

I had no choice but to pass the ball to Gennaro and quickly sprint to the danger zone without looking back.

Gennaro, with whom I hadn't played in a while, knew exactly what I wanted.

That's why you need to play together for a long time, right?

- Gennaro Tatis with a long pass!

- Minho! Minho catches the ball with a beautiful touch!

The long pass connected perfectly.

As I lightly caught the slightly long pass, Aiba Cabanes, who was next to me, was startled.

I faked a shot to trick Aiba, who was quickly stretching his leg towards me.

Swish!

I lightly pushed the ball past the sliding Aiba Cabanes and took a shot with my left foot.

Boom!

As I watched the perfect shot shake Rome's net again, I clenched my fist tightly.

- Goooooooal!

- Minho! Minho! A fantastic goal! Minho scores the winning goal! Amazing! Amazing!

- Minho, who came in as a substitute and scored multiple goals in an instant! Aaaaah!

The home fans were screaming.

The little kid who was angry at me earlier was now crying loudly.

- Ah! A little fan who came to support Rome is crying.

- It shows how devastating this winning goal was, even to the little fan.

- With this, Minho achieves his 10th league goal.

- His scoring pace is truly impressive.

Seeing that little kid makes me feel a bit sorry again.

The score was reversed to 3-2 in an instant.

With not much time left, Rome had no choice but to push the line up urgently.

Thanks to that, both teams engaged in a fierce offensive and defensive battle for the remaining 20 minutes.

However, neither we nor Rome managed to produce any significant results in the remaining time.

Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!

The referee blew the whistle, signaling the end of the match.

After the match, I approached the little Rome fan who was crying with my uniform in my hand.

As I got closer to the stands, the Rome home fans watched me with cautious eyes.

But when they saw me taking off my uniform and giving it to the child, they seemed much less hostile than before.

“This is my uniform.”

“Sniff...”

“You seemed so sad, so I'm giving it to you as a gift.”

“Thank you.”

Seeing the child smile slightly as he received my uniform made me smile happily too.

Whether this scene was captured by the broadcast camera, the home fans suddenly started applauding me.

It makes me feel embarrassed.

* * *

[Once again, a winning goal! Minho shows his strength in big games without reserve!]

[Minho scores his 10th league goal! Showing an incredible scoring pace in Serie A!]

[Parma on a rampage! Can they challenge for an undefeated season in Serie A?]

[Minho gifts his uniform to a crying Rome fan! Receives applause from home fans!]

[Coach Martignu: ‘Minho is an extraordinary player. We lost to Minho, not Parma. I would love to coach him.’]

[AS Roma representative: ‘We are very interested in acquiring Minho. We are capable of paying a transfer fee of 52 million euros.’]

The day Parma won 3-2.

Watching the game on TV, Roberto clenched his fist and shouted loudly.

“Minhooooooo!”

Then, waking up his younger sibling, he was told, “Oppa, are you crazy?” and sat quietly back on the sofa.

But the excitement hadn't faded from his face.

“This makes it 9 matches in the league with 8 wins and 1 draw, undefeated!”

Who could have predicted this?

That Parma would continue to stay at the top of Serie A.

No one could have imagined it.

Even die-hard Parma fans like Roberto hadn't expected much from Parma this season.

Just staying in the league would have been considered a successful season.

That was Parma's goal for this season.

But now, as October approached, Parma had not come down from the top of the league.

This fact brought joy to Roberto.

Moreover, the potential of young players who were called up in large numbers or acquired from other clubs this season had exploded.

Thanks to that, the defense, which was pointed out as a weakness in the early season, turned into a strength.

Especially, the form of goalkeeper Jose Juan, who guarded the goal, was no joke.

He was an incredible goalkeeper who kept five clean sheets in nine league matches.

Some were extremely excited, saying that Parma had properly brought in the second De Gea.

But they didn’t rejoice too much.

The match against Sampdoria on October 5th.

And the match against Spezia on October 15th were followed by three consecutive matches against strong teams waiting for Parma.

However, Roberto couldn't suppress the swelling anticipation in his heart.

If it’s Parma, and if it’s Park Minho, he was sure they would achieve results beyond his expectations.

* * *

The recent trend is not very good.

The winning streak that had been going well was broken with a draw against the league's bottom team, Sampdoria.

However, we narrowly continued our winning streak with a 3-2 victory against Spezia in the league.

But we suffered our first defeat of the season with a 1-0 loss in the away match against Servette in the Europa League 4th round, where we rotated the full squad.

Watching Parma slightly falter before the match against Juventus, some experts expressed concerns.

They said the young players were starting to feel the pressure.

Of course, that statement is not true.

It was just a mistake in the process of rotating and raising the performance of the backups.

Anyway, amidst a slight dip in momentum.

On October 24th, we face Juventus, who are currently 2nd in the league.

To be honest, my expectations were high.

Because they are as strong as Inter.

Juventus currently holds the record for the fewest goals conceded in the league.

They've conceded 3 fewer goals than us and have only conceded 5 goals in the 11 league matches so far.

That’s how solid their defense is, steadily climbing the ranks and eventually catching up to us.

However, it wasn’t the Juventus that showed tremendous performance in Serie A in the past.

Juventus' league scoring rank is 10th.

They are stuck right in the middle.

Their attack has been largely disappointing, and naturally, Juventus fans were showing their frustration.

- KingWangJangYube: Ugh... Ugo! Please score some goals!

- KingWangJangYube: Finally, the league title is within reach... Why is our attack so quiet?

- KingWangJangYube: What’s wrong with Dybala again?

With Juventus' key player, Patricia Dybala, also being silent, Sungkyung, a hardcore Juventus fan, had a sulky face.

- RealMilan: Is it Juventus' turn this time?

- LoveMilan: They need to be properly disciplined by Minho to be called a strong team in Serie A.

- Roberto: Hey... Serie A’s strongest Juventus! Brace yourself! Parma’s weakest will sting a bit!

- KingWangJangYube: Who showed this guy Japanese cartoons? It’s really creepy.

- RealMilan: Yeah, it’s going to be more creepy when Minho scores a goal! Kukurubingbangbong!

Seeing my friends having fun made me feel a strange urge to seek attention.

My fingers were itching.

Ah, I can’t resist this.

- Park Minho: The villain of Serie A! Making a grand entrance!

- RealMilan: Wow... That’s cool! Juventus will be utterly destroyed!

- LoveMilan: Bianconeri jerks lol are you scared?

- Roberto: Wow! Juventus! Wait for it! The zebra killer Minho is coming!

My friends got excited after reading my chat.

Of course, Sungkyung was in despair.

- KingWangJangYube: No... Minho! Why are you doing this suddenly? You liked Juventus!

- Park Minho: Dunno

Who said I liked Juventus?

Where did they pick up such a strange article?

I don’t particularly have a favorite club.

- Monika: Minho likes Arsenal, doesn’t he?

- Park Minho: That’s even more wrong.

- Monika: ?

- RealMilan: ?

- LoveMilan: ?

Not Arsenal either.

Monika was frantically sending me personal messages, but I quietly turned it off.

Lately, teasing Monika has been quite enjoyable.

Aren't you scared?

Not at all.

Humans are adaptive creatures.

You get used to everything.

Anyway.

I want to mess with Juventus, who are on edge after missing out on the title for two consecutive years.

My other teammates probably feel the same way.

Being in the top spot in the league continuously brings pressure, but it also provides strong motivation as much as the pressure.

After finishing the new tactical training added to prepare for the Juventus match, I was slowly catching my breath when Bbanjili asked.

“Minho, are you not nervous?”

Not nervous?

Well, I do feel nervous.

“The reason you have those thoughts is because you haven’t moved your body enough.”

“What?”

“Shall we run together for another hour?”

“No! Absolutely not! I’m totally not nervous right now!”

Bbanjili freaked out and ran to the shower room.

Despite saying that, Santiago, who has been showing consistent form this season, was the one who had grown the most.

He was a player who showed inconsistency just last season, but now he had grown to this point, which felt quite emotional.

Time really flies.

* * *

Juventus' home.

The stadium, which has been called ‘Allianz Stadium’ since June 1, 2017, due to a naming rights contract until the 22-23 season, was filled with Juventus home fans.

For Parma, memories of this stadium and Juventus are not so good.

The first official match held at Allianz Stadium was the Serie A opening match against Parma in the 11-12 season, where Juventus' Stephan Lichtsteiner scored.

Parma lost 4-1 in that match.

So, the Parma fans who followed to Turin and filled the away stands of Allianz Stadium watched the game with a sense of unease.

No matter how well Parma was doing.

The opponent was Juventus.

A team with the strength of winning Serie A for 9 consecutive seasons from the 11-12 season to the 19-20 season.

Naturally, the worries of the Parma fans who followed to the away match were immense.

“Can we win?”

“We can. Recently, Juventus' form hasn't been great, and we have Minho.”

“Yeah, we have Minho.”

Parma has Minho.

This one fact allowed Parma's away fans to watch the field with a bit of relief.

Conversely, Juventus home fans were filled with confidence.

Even if the attack was sluggish, Juventus' defense this season was really solid and excellent.

“If it were an away match, it would be different, but this is our home.”

“Minho? Well, he's good... But not enough to break through our defense.”

“This season is the right time. Parma lacks depth, so they will inevitably collapse in the second half. If we win this match, we can finish the first half of the season as leaders.”

“We lost the league title to Nerazzurri for two consecutive seasons. We must reclaim it this season.”

Knowing that this match was crucial, Juventus home fans sang their cheers louder.

Soon, the players of both teams entered the field.

The enormous cheers of the Bianconeri filled Allianz Stadium.

“Show them what Juventus is made of!”

“Ugoooo! Score a goal today!”

“Show that dumb Asian what the best defense in the league looks like!”

Juventus, under coach Arrelliano Allegri, came out with a compact flat 4-4-2 formation for this match.

It felt a bit different from the usual diamond 4-4-2 with a central focus.

Of course, only the formation had changed.

The defensive style emphasizing organized play with a lowered line instead of loose pressing, and the attacking style utilizing players' characteristics rather than detailed tactics, remained largely unchanged.

Coach Allegri looked at the field with a confident expression, determined to win.

He was determined to win today's match no matter what.

He had completed his preparation to counter Parma's 3-4-3 formation perfectly.

But then.

Despite having prepared perfectly.

Despite having prepared a strategy tailored to the opponent's tactics.

Why was Parma's formation so different from what he had expected?

“What? Why is Minho in the third line?”

“A 5-4-1 formation? They’ve completely dropped back.”

“That’s completely... a ten-back?”

It wasn’t attacking football.

It was perfect ‘parking the bus’.

Parma had brought out ‘ten-back’ in front of Juventus, who desperately wanted to take all three points at home.

Like a formidable villain standing in front of heroes.
