## 6. National Team? Me? Why?(1)

World Best Agency.

In short, WB Agency is an agency founded by Leo Carpentieri, who is Park Minho's agent.

This place operates on a 'select elite' basis.

In other words, it is a mid-sized agency consisting of a few outstandingly talented players.

Because of this, there are no mid-tier players, which sometimes leads to financial difficulties. However, they have overcome these challenges and established themselves as a well-recognized agency.

Anyways.

They have a unique department that other agencies can hardly imitate.

The PR team.

That is, the 'Documentary Production Team' belonging to the PR team was a unique department that no other agency had.

In fact, it was Leo Carpentieri who instructed the creation of this department.

The moment he watched 'Sunderland 'Til I Die,' he thought they should make documentaries for players, not clubs.

It was, in some ways, a simple documentary that organized the player's life from childhood to the present.

Some employees asked, "How does that help the players?"

But Leo just showed an inscrutable smile.

And as 'Sunderland 'Til I Die' became a hit and various club documentaries gained popularity, the documentaries of players from his agency also began to spread by word of mouth.

It wasn’t the fans of the players spreading it.

It was the scouts from various clubs who spread the word.

When Leo produced a documentary of his first player, Bruno Campos, the current AC Milan midfielder, he included everything about Bruno.

His strengths, the life he lived, how others viewed his character, and even his weaknesses and bad traits.

In an industry where highlighting only the strengths is the norm, Leo's documentary was not a good packaging.

However, for clubs that had recently been burned by young players with poor mentality and character, this documentary that revealed both strengths and weaknesses was appealing.

They could understand who the player was and determine if he would fit into their team through the documentary.

Therefore, after watching Bruno Campos' documentary, AC Milan contacted him.

The result was immensely successful.

Last year, AC Milan securing second place in Serie A was largely thanks to Bruno Campos, who almost perfectly protected the team's defense from the third line.

"We are extremely satisfied with this signing."

"Especially, watching the documentary allowed us to understand how Bruno grew and the mindset he had."

"Thanks to that, we could predict the chemistry he would show when he joined our squad."

"Yes, this signing was successful as we expected."

The director of AC Milan was highly satisfied.

At the same time, other documentaries began to be produced.

Leo's other players also started to film these documentaries one by one, leading to more successful transfers.

Of course, it wasn’t always successful.

Revealing weaknesses significantly affected the player's market value.

This led to some disappointing results in negotiations.

Nevertheless, Leo did not stop producing these documentaries.

And this word of mouth spread so much that some OTT platforms contacted them first.

That renowned documentary production team was now in Korea.

To produce a documentary of the 10th player personally managed by Leo.

To make a documentary of Park Minho.

(What kind of player was Park Minho?)

"Minho?"

"Minho...he was fine. He consistently enjoyed football and was more sincere about it than anyone else."

"But...he wasn't a rapidly growing player."

Coach Lee In-tae calmly answered in front of the camera.

He was Park Minho's mentor during high school.

(Do you mean his talent was ambiguous?)

"Not that... How should I put it?"

"Players called geniuses grow in an upward curve like riding an escalator."

"But... Minho was different. He certainly grew, but it was like climbing a cliff?"

"He learns much faster than other kids. But his ability to apply what he learned is very lacking."

"So, it's like climbing a cliff. He’s certainly growing, but Minho struggles."

"To Minho, it looks like others are riding an escalator and going up comfortably."

"While he himself is struggling to climb a cliff."

Yes, Park Minho was such a player.

He learned quickly to be a late bloomer.

But he lacked the brilliance to be called a genius.

A somewhat ambiguous player.

(What was his personality like?)

"He says he is timid. But from my perspective, he is not timid but very cautious."

"That's probably why he quit football after graduating high school because he knew his chances of succeeding in football were not very high."

"Or... even if he succeeded, it would take a long time. Back then, Minho was in urgent need of money. I heard he worked at a factory while attending college to pay for his father's hospital bills. Because of that, his grades were terrible. He said it was because he enjoyed playing football while in college..."

But he knew that wasn't the case.

Thanks to Minho’s one-year struggle, his father recovered and now runs a restaurant successfully.

The restaurant did so well that Park Minho could go to Italy to study in Parma after completing his military service.

Yes, he was a filial son with a kind heart.

(You still keep in touch?)

"Of course. Among the students I raised, Minho still... I feel regretful. If only he had a bit more time, I had confidence I could have made him an outstanding football player."

"That's why I feel more regretful."

He deeply regretted not being able to see Park Minho's debut match with his own eyes.

(How did you feel when you heard that Park Minho debuted in Serie B?)

"I was surprised."

"I was really surprised when I suddenly heard such news from Italy."

Coach Lee In-tae was relieved nonetheless.

A talented player had returned to the football world.

So he could smile brightly more than anyone else.

(If you could coach Park Minho again, how would you like to train him?)

"I said this before. Park Minho learns incredibly fast but lacks the ability to apply it."

(Yes, you said that.)

"I would probably show him a bunch of Messi highlight videos and tell him to imitate them. Honestly, if he could imitate half of that, he would be the best in Korea."

"Haha... Just kidding."

"No matter how good Minho's learning ability is, would he be able to perfectly imitate something just by watching a video?"

Coach Lee In-tae laughed.

Even he thought it was nonsense.

If watching videos could make everyone imitate Messi, anyone could be Messi, he laughed heartily.

* * *

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The game ended.

"Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!"

Carlito angrily kicked the grass.

A 4 to 1 home defeat.

Home fans of S.P.A.L were hurling insults and boos at their team.

Boooooo!

Carlito, you bastard!

Can't you even block that? You bastard!

Carlito wasn't feeling good.

A player who was playing on the flank for the first time managed to dribble past him several times.

Thanks to that, he became the main culprit for today's defeat and was harshly criticized by the home fans.

Still, after the damn Asian kid was substituted in at the 18th minute of the second half, it was manageable.

But the 3-goal deficit didn't narrow any further.

At that moment, Park Minho approached from afar.

Carlito lightly shook hands with him, who was wearing a jacket.

The words Park Minho left shattered Carlito’s already broken mentality into pieces.

"Next time, I'll watch more Hazard videos."

Carlito thought.

I really don't like this guy.

So he responded with a sharp retort.

"Why don't you just watch Messi videos?"

Park Minho nodded seriously with a strangely serious expression and replied.

"That sounds good too."

"Sure, if you can even imitate half of Messi, I'll buy you a fancy sports car. Well... if it's even possible."

"Alright, I'll try to play like Messi next time."

Hearing that, Carlito thought.

This Asian guy's bluffing is on another level.

[Minho Shows His Presence Both in the Center and on the Left! Becomes a Reliable Option for Parma!]

[Coach Alain Levagne, ‘Minho? He looked like Hazard today. We might even use him at the forefront next time.’]

[Comments]

-Amazing! They beat S.P.A.L!

-Minho’s move to the flank was the best choice. As expected, Coach Alain Levagne is amazing!

-Can't believe such a player was free... It’s surreal.

-Now we can think about tactics with Franco in the center, Minho on the left, and Santiago on the right in important matches.

-Can we expect great things this season?

-Raise Juventus' player well. We need to take him later.

-Shut up. Idiots.

Out of 2 league games, I started one and substituted in the other, scoring 1 goal.

My performance was quite decent.

Considering the Italian Cup, it was enough to become a key player for the team.

[3 Consecutive Wins in the League! Parma Takes the Lead Alone!]

(Serie B Round 3)

-Parma Calcio 3 : 1 Vicenza

Of course, I started in the next game as well.

I played 61 minutes and recorded 1 assist.

-Park Minho-

3 games in the league, 1 goal, 1 assist.

1 game in the Italian Cup, 2 goals, 2 assists.

4 games in the season, 3 goals, 3 assists, 1 MVP.

I continued to perform excellently.

However, I wasn’t satisfied.

"So... this way, like this."

"I see, it can be solved like this too."

Watching Santiago dribble, I learned one thing at a time today as well.

Certainly, Santiago had more talent than me.

Unlike me, who could only do one thing after learning one, he could do two or three things.

"Amazing."

"Actually, I think you are more amazing, Minho."

"Really? I envy your talent more."

I just did exactly what Santiago showed.

Rather, I envied Santiago's talent.

Well, Santiago looked at me with a confused expression after hearing what I said.

"You're not mocking me, right?"

"No, I’m serious."

Yes, I was sincere.

"Anyway, you’ll rest well for two weeks then."

"Yeah, the A-match week is coming, right? Aren’t you going?"

"Think about who’s in my position."

Ah! Messi is in Santiago’s position.

Poor guy.

"Isn’t Minho called up for the national team? With this performance, they should call you at least once."

"No coach is crazy enough to call a late-blooming rookie who just debuted. And it's the national team... They would call much younger and more talented players than me."

"Well... that’s true."

Santiago nodded.

At that moment, a coach with a pale face ran towards me from afar.

"Minho! Minho!"

"Is something wrong?"

The coach nodded vigorously at my question.

"The national team called you! Minho!"

Hearing that, I was dumbfounded.

Wait, the national team?

It was so sudden that I hurriedly asked the coach.

"National team?"
