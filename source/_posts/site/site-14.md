## 6. National Team? Me? Why?(1)

World Best Agency.

Known as WB Agency, it was founded by Leo Carpentieri, Park Minho's agent.

This place prides itself on "elite few."

In other words, it’s a mid-sized agency comprising a small number of players with exceptional talent.

Because of this, they sometimes faced financial difficulties due to the lack of mid-tier players.

However, they overcame these challenges and established themselves as a reputable agency.

Anyway.

They have a unique department that no other agency has.

The PR Team.

More specifically, the 'Documentary Production Team' within the PR Team was unique to this agency.

In fact, it was Leo Carpentieri who instructed the creation of this department.

When he watched 'Sunderland 'Til I Die,' he thought that creating documentaries for players rather than clubs would be a great idea.

A simple documentary summarizing the player's life from childhood to the present.

Some employees questioned, "How would this benefit the players?"

Leo just responded with a mysterious smile.

As 'Sunderland 'Til I Die' succeeded and various club documentaries gained attention,

the documentaries of the agency's players also started to gain word-of-mouth popularity.

It wasn’t the fans of the players who spread the word.

It was the scouts of various clubs.

When Leo created a documentary for his first player,

Bruno Campos, the current midfielder of AC Milan,

he included everything about Bruno.

His strengths, his life journey,

how others viewed his personality, and even his weaknesses and bad traits.

In a field where only highlighting strengths is common, Leo's documentary was far from being a good wrapper.

But it appealed to clubs who had been burned by the poor mentality and character of promising players.

They could understand the player's character and assess if he would fit into their team.

As a result, AC Milan approached Bruno Campos after watching his documentary.

The outcome was incredibly successful.

Last year, AC Milan finishing second in Serie A was largely thanks to Bruno Campos, who almost perfectly protected the team's defense from the midfield.

"It was a very satisfying acquisition."

"Especially, by watching the player's documentary, we could understand how Bruno grew and what mindset he had."

"Thanks to this, we could predict what kind of chemistry he would bring to our team."

"Yes, this acquisition was successful as we expected."

The director of AC Milan was very satisfied.

Simultaneously, other documentaries began to be produced.

Leo's other players gradually filmed these documentaries, leading to successful transfers.

Of course, it wasn't always successful.

Revealing weaknesses significantly impacted the player's market value.

This sometimes resulted in disappointing negotiations.

However, Leo did not stop producing these documentaries.

And the word spread to the extent that some OTT platforms approached them first.

That renowned documentary production team was now in Korea.

To produce a documentary on Leo's 10th player,

Park Minho.

(What kind of player was Park Minho?)

"Minho?"

"Minho… he was alright. He consistently enjoyed soccer and was more passionate about it than anyone else."

"But… he wasn't a player who grew quickly."

This was the calm response of Coach Lee In-tae in front of the camera.

He was Park Minho's mentor during his high school days.

(Do you mean his talent was ambiguous?)

"Not that... How should I put it?"

“Players called geniuses grow on an upward curve like riding an escalator.”

“But… Minho was different. He definitely grew, but it was like climbing a cliff.”

“He learned faster than other kids. But his ability to apply what he learned was very lacking.”

“So, it was like he was growing but struggling as if climbing a cliff.”

“To Minho, it looked like others were comfortably riding an escalator while he was struggling up a cliff.”

Yes, Park Minho was such a player.

Too quick to learn to be called a late bloomer.

But lacking the brilliance to be called a genius.

An ambiguous player.

(What was his personality like?)

"He said he was very cautious. But from my perspective, he wasn't cautious; he was very prudent."

"That's why he quit soccer after graduating high school. He knew his chances of success in soccer weren't high."

"Or… even if he succeeded, it would take a long time. He needed money urgently back then. I heard he attended college and worked in a factory to pay for his father's hospital bills. Because of that, his grades plummeted. He said it was because he enjoyed soccer while attending college, but…"

Coach Lee knew that wasn't the truth.

Thanks to Minho’s year of hard work, his father recovered, and he now runs a successful restaurant.

That restaurant did so well that Park Minho could serve in the military and then study abroad in Parma, Italy.

Yes, he was a filial son and kind-hearted.

(Do you still keep in touch with him?)

"Yes. He's one of my students that I still feel… regretful about. I was confident I could have nurtured him into an exceptional soccer player if I had just a little more time."

"That's why it's more regretful."

It was a great regret that he couldn't witness Park Minho's debut match with his own eyes.

(How did you feel when you heard that Park Minho made his debut in Serie B?)

"I was surprised."

"To suddenly hear such news from Italy was really surprising."

Coach Lee was relieved.

A talented player had returned to the soccer world.

So he could smile more brightly than anyone.

(If you could coach Park Minho again… how would you want to train him?)

"I mentioned this before. Park Minho learns very quickly but lacks application skills."

(Yes, you did mention that.)

"I'd probably show him Messi's highlight videos and tell him to imitate them. Honestly, even if he imitates half of it, he could be the best in Korea."

"Hahaha… I'm just joking."

"No matter how good Minho's learning ability is, can he fully imitate something just by watching a video?"

Coach Lee laughed.

He knew it was unrealistic.

If someone could imitate everything by just watching, anyone could become Messi, he laughed heartily.

* * *

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The match ended.

"Shit! Shit! Shit!"

Carlito angrily kicked the grass.

A 4-1 home defeat.

The home fans hurled insults and jeers at the S.P.A.L team they supported.

Boo! Boo! Boo!

Carlito, you son of a bitch!

Can't even stop that? You son of a bitch!

Carlito was not in a good mood.

A newcomer playing on the flank had repeatedly broken through against him.

As a result, he became the scapegoat for today’s defeat and faced harsh criticism from home fans.

Nonetheless, he fared better after the damn Asian was substituted in the 63rd minute.

However, the three-goal deficit did not narrow any further.

Then, from a distance, Park Minho approached.

Carlito shook hands with him lightly, as he wore a jacket.

The words Minho left shattered Carlito’s already fragile mental state, grinding it into dust.

"I'll watch more Hazard videos next time."

Carlito thought.

I really don't like this guy.

So he shot back with a sharp retort.

"Why not watch Messi videos instead?"

Hearing this, Park Minho nodded seriously with a peculiar expression and replied.

"That might be a good idea."

"Sure, if you can emulate even half of Messi, I'll buy you an expensive sports car later. Though... I doubt you can."

"Alright, I'll try to play like Messi someday."

Carlito thought after hearing Minho's response.

This Asian guy has some serious swagger.

[Is it really a super team? S.P.A.L’s shocking defeat!]

[Parma's excellent tactics! Minho's movement on the flank is noteworthy!]

[Minho ranks 2nd in the team ratings! Second only to MVP Lautaro Valentia!]

[Minho stands out on both central and left positions! Becomes a definitive option for Parma!]

[Coach Alain Lavin: “Minho? He looked like Hazard today. Next time, we might position him at the forefront.”]

[Comments]

- Amazing! They beat S.P.A.L!

- Moving Minho to the flank was the best decision. Coach Alain Lavin is extraordinary!

- It's incredible that a player like this was a free transfer. So thrilled.

- We could deploy Franco in central, Minho on the left, and Santiago on the right for crucial games.

- Can we expect great things this season?

- Raise the player well, Juventus. We'll take him later.

- Shut up. Idiots.

Out of the two league games, I started one and came on as a substitute in the other, scoring one goal.

My performance was quite decent.

Considering the Italian Cup, I had performed well enough to become a key player for the team.

[Three consecutive wins in the league! Parma leads alone!]

(Serie B Round 3)

- Parma Calcio 3 : 1 Vicenza

Naturally, I started in the next match too.

I played for 61 minutes and recorded one assist.

- Park Minho -

League: 3 matches, 1 goal, 1 assist.

Italian Cup: 1 match, 2 goals, 2 assists.

Season: 4 matches, 3 goals, 3 assists, 1 MVP.

I continued to perform exceptionally.

But I wasn’t satisfied.

"So... like this, in this way."

"And you can also approach it this way."

Watching Santiago’s dribbling, I learned something new today.

Santiago was definitely more talented than me.

Unlike me, who could only do one thing after learning it, Santiago could do two or three things.

"That's impressive."

"Actually, I think you're more impressive, Minho."

"Really? I'm envious of your talent."

I just imitated what Santiago showed.

But I envied Santiago's talent.

Well, Santiago looked at me with a puzzled expression.

"You're not mocking me, are you?"

"No, I'm serious."

Yes, I was serious.

"Anyway, you’ll get to rest for two weeks."

"The international match period is coming up, right? Aren't you going?"

"Think about who plays in my position."

Ah! Messi plays in Santiago's position.

Poor guy.

"Won't the national team call you, Minho? With your performance, they should call you at least once."

"No coach would be crazy enough to call a late-blooming rookie who just debuted. Especially for the national team... They'd call much younger and more talented players."

"Well... true."

Santiago nodded in agreement.

Just then, a coach with a pale face ran towards me from afar.

"Minho! Minho!"

"What's the matter?"

I asked, and the coach nodded vigorously.

"The national team called you! Minho!"

Upon hearing that, I was stunned.

Wait, the national team suddenly?

I was so flustered that I hurriedly asked the coach.

"The national team?"
