## 39. Scoring Competition (2)

[How Has Arsenal Become Such a Strong Team?]

- Is it because they’re doing so well lately? Voodoo magic is rampant.
- Don’t jinx it! You bastard!
- Arsenal is doing so well these days that something feels off. Maybe this world is actually a simulation?

[Park Minho Competes with Ronaldo for EPL Top Scorer!]

- A top scorer from Arsenal...? Ugh! My head!
- Remember King Henry. Don’t think of that backstabber.
- Just thinking of that backstabber gives me a headache! Tsk tsk...
- The only top scorer from Arsenal is King Henry.

[Money Doesn’t Lie? The Reason for Arsenal’s Success, with 1.3 Times More Investment Than Last Season?]

- If that were the case, PSG would have lifted the big ears.
- That’s right. Not everything can be solved with money.
- In that sense, I like Jade Kroenke’s approach. Unlike his stingy father, he spends money efficiently, which I appreciate even more.

The day after Arsenal beat Everton.

Korean Gooners were in disbelief at Arsenal’s recent undefeated run.

It was so different from what they thought when they recruited me, wondering if I could bring back the glory of the past “4-senal.”

We were holding a solid first place in the league undefeated.

Of course, the older Gooners were different.

Having witnessed Arsenal's undefeated season in the past, they watched the current Arsenal’s progress with a face full of expectations, unlike the younger ones.

They didn’t make a fuss.

They were too afraid that this happiness might disappear at any moment.

In that sense, Monica was also checking Arsenal’s league standings every day with a happy smile.

Anyway.

Arsenal’s next opponent after the win against Everton was Basel, the opponent in the Europa League Group F.

For Arsenal, who had already secured the next stage, the next match was just for checking the condition of the rotation members.

But that didn’t mean they prepared poorly.

Winning even in low-value matches greatly boosts the players’ confidence.

- Gaaabriel Martinelli!
- Here comes a fantastic turning shot!
- Arsenal is showing overwhelming performance against Basel with a squad close to their second string.

In the match against Basel, I and a few other players were given a break, not even on the bench.

It meant that for the first time, I sat in the stands with Monica.

“Kyaaaaaa!”

But then, a pterosaur appeared next to me.

The pterosaur, appearing with an enormous cheer, left a significant scar on my eardrums before disappearing.

“Isn’t it... too loud?”

“No, it’s fine.”

She looked at me shyly, gauging my reaction.

Well, except for the ear pain, I thought it was a good date.

Arsenal won 3-0 against Basel at home, Monica and the Gooners smiled happily, and the main players could save their energy.

Thus, the last schedule of November ended well, and the first opponent of December was ‘Chelsea.’

The second London derby, a relatively uneventful derby without a large police presence, bus attacks on the team, or stadium damage, was upon us.

* * *

Recently, two teams enjoy Tottenham’s slump.

They are Chelsea, the protagonist of the fierce Northwest London Derby that has become more intense than the North London Derby after the Stamford Bridge battle, and Arsenal, the protagonist of the North London Derby.

And Chelsea and Arsenal, with a common enemy, had a surprisingly amicable derby relationship.

Of course, the situation could change if any incidents occurred, but so far, the relationship between the two teams was smooth.

Anyway.

The situation of the six teams once called the Big Six was quite different from each other.

Tottenham was flirting with relegation, facing the biggest crisis in the club’s history.

Manchester City and Chelsea, undergoing rebuilding, were positioned fifth and seventh in the league, respectively, focusing on reorganizing their teams.

With good managers in place, they would soon finish reorganizing their squads and challenge for the title again.

And Arsenal, Liverpool, and Manchester United, holding the top three spots in the league, were challenging for the title with more points than other teams.

Among them, Arsenal and Liverpool were battling for the first place in the league with just a one-point difference.

Although Arsenal was in a favorable situation with one less game played, the next opponent was Chelsea, so a win was crucial.

Conversely, Chelsea could rise to fourth place in the league with a win against Arsenal.

In a way, the match between Arsenal and Chelsea could be seen as a six-point game.

Moreover, with Park Minho and Ronaldo’s scoring competition heating up, the match would undoubtedly provide many spectacles for EPL fans.

Naturally, broadcasters focused on the match between the two teams.

Who would win, and could Park Minho catch up to Ronaldo by scoring in this match?

Ronaldo had scored in the previous match against West Ham, creating a two-goal gap with Park Minho, who was in second place.

If he didn’t score today, the gap with the top scorer Ronaldo would widen.

Of course, Park Minho, who was focusing on training ahead of the Chelsea match, didn’t pay much attention.

He believed that if he consistently showed good performance, he would catch up eventually.

Moreover, Ronaldo’s tremendous form was likely to drop significantly in the second half due to physical issues.

Last season, he showed explosive performance with 12 goals in the first half but only scored one goal in the second half, showing a disappointing performance.

While the player’s career longevity has increased, allowing them to play into their late thirties, it was still tough to maintain the stamina required for the tight EPL schedule.

And the day of the first match of December, the 13th round of the Premier League, finally arrived.

The Gooners, filling up the Emirates Stadium, were enthusiastically raising their voices.

“Score more goals than that dumbass Ronaldo!”

“Don’t lose to someone worse than Messi!”

“Minooooooo!”

“Show that arrogant Portuguese bastard the spicy taste of kimchi!”

Perhaps because of some strange remarks I heard?

Park Minho glanced back with a startled expression and then turned his head again.

Before the match against Chelsea.

The Gooners seemed to be quite upset by Ronaldo’s interview after Manchester United’s win over West Ham, in which he scored.

“Booooooo!”

“Send Manchester United to hell!”

“Minooooooo!”

Even though it was a match against Chelsea, some Gooners were shouting about killing Manchester United.

The Chelsea players, looking bewildered, asked the Arsenal players, "Why are those guys acting like that?"

The players soon spread out on the field.

After checking his watch, the referee saw that both teams’ players were in their positions and blew the whistle to start the match energetically.

* * *

[Ronaldo: This season, Manchester United is the overwhelming favorite to win. Arsenal’s success is just a flash in the pan. The title race will likely be between Manchester United and Liverpool.]

Contrary to the general trend of fiery-tempered players becoming calmer as they age, the legendary player from Portugal seemed to be turning into a child, which was sad.

Anyway.

After that interview, the Arsenal fans’ hostility towards Manchester United and Ronaldo grew significantly.

Thanks to that, even though today’s opponent was Chelsea, some Gooners expressed their hatred towards Manchester United.

As a football player, getting booed on away trips is natural, but seeing home fans cursing a completely different team on an away trip must be a first.

As the match started, Ricardo Bastoni, positioned next to me as a marker, asked quietly.

Having transferred from Serie A to EPL like me this season, he didn’t understand the current situation.

Of course, I didn’t understand it either.

“Is EPL always like this?”

“No, it’s just that our Gooners are unique.”

“Oh... I was surprised because it’s so different from Serie A.”

Anyway, he asked me to go easy on him, but hearing that from Ricardo Bastoni, who was the core defender of Inter, ignited my rebellious spirit.

When asked to go easy, I wanted to make it harder.

Isn’t that human nature?

What? Are you saying I’m just a nasty person?

Anyway.

As the match started, Chelsea moved in perfect harmony under coach Del Bas’s command.

Indeed, Chelsea had only fallen into a slight slump.

The players’ tactical movements and individual skills were excellent enough to challenge for the title.

Therefore, it was crucial to dominate in the first half to face them comfortably in the second half.

While Tyler Smith Rowe on the opposite side was moving around and troubling Chelsea’s defense, I smoothly received a pass from Bruno Campos.

I then moved diligently to create space, aiming to trouble Chelsea’s flanks.

As soon as I got the ball, Chelsea descended quickly, proving they were not an easy opponent to break through.

But if asked whether they were a difficult opponent, I could firmly shake my head.

- Mino! He catches the ball and runs quickly!
- It’s terrifying. He simply dribbles past Chelsea’s Ben Chilwell without any special footwork!

While I was breaking through the flank, our team’s target man, Lorenzo Lupo, moved deep into the center.

Passing shortly to him was undoubtedly a good option, but directly driving in and troubling Chelsea’s defense wasn’t a bad choice either.

- Mino! He penetrates even deeper!
- Mino approaches the empty space as Lorenzo Lupo takes the defender with him!

My keen sense told me.

This is a chance to score.

Though the angle was a bit tricky, I confidently took the shot, and Chelsea’s goalkeeper Edward Mendy dived.

- Mendy! He dives and blocks Mino’s shot!
- A fantastic save! Mendy saves Chelsea!

How did he block that?

My shot turned into a corner kick due to Chelsea’s goalkeeper Edward Mendy’s super save.

Regrettable, but there were still opportunities left.

I raised my hand to signal Tyler, moving to the opposite corner for the corner kick.

Let’s show the pattern we practiced in training.

Tyler nodded after confirming my signal.

I moved behind Lorenzo and drew the letter ‘B’ with my finger on his back.

Lorenzo, glancing back to check on me, nodded and moved to an appropriate position.

- It’s a corner kick situation.
- Lorenzo Lupo positions himself quite close.

- Just as I’m saying, here comes Tyler’s corner kick!

Tyler’s corner kick flew low and fast.

Positioning myself behind Lorenzo to take advantage of the Chelsea defense’s focus on him, I moved around.

Since the corner kick was low and whipped, trying to kick it was out of the question. I confidently put my head in the ball’s trajectory.

And the ball flew fast.

Thunk!

At least I felt the ball hit my head.

And that ball crossed the goal line cleanly, shaking the net.

- Goooooooal!
- Mino scores the opening goal! Arsenal takes the lead against Chelsea in the 9th minute of the first half!
- The Chelsea defense entirely missed Mino’s movement around Lorenzo Lupo!
- It’s a well-prepared corner kick tactic. Here, though Edward Mendy reacted to Mino’s header, he slightly slipped due to the reverse motion, leading to the goal.
- It must be quite disappointing for Mendy.

A clean opening goal.

As soon as the ball went in, I slid towards the fans, tapping Arsenal’s emblem with my right hand, causing the fans to shout my name loudly.

Minooooooo!

Yes, this is why I score goals.

As I spread my arms, the cheers grew louder.

I guess this is why strikers are so dedicated to scoring goals.

To hear these cheers.

Minooooo! Marry me!

Come ooooon! Mino!

Uwaaaa! You’re the best, Mino!

Though accepting the proposal from the chubby Gooner uncle who took off his shirt was a bit challenging, the cheers from the other fans were really delightful.

Yes, it really felt good.
