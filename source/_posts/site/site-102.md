## 38. The Value of a Name (2)

A goal was scored in an instant.

The players of Brighton were left dumbfounded.

Arsenal's players, who had been moving centrally, suddenly sent one pass each to the flanks, quickly connecting the ball to the danger zone and finishing it off.

They were surprised by the unexpected movement.

But they couldn't just sit back and take it.

This was their home, and they had no intention of being defeated helplessly in this match.

- Brighton! Yes! This is Brighton! Pushing Arsenal back in an instant!

- Centered around Ethan Blacksmith, Brighton is delaying Arsenal's offensive with strong pressure from the center! This is originally Coach Steven Gerrard's tactic, right?

Eventually, they went on the offensive.

They couldn't just hide like a turtle when they might not even get a single point.

Thanks to this, the tempo of the game began to rise quickly.

At the same time, the stamina consumption of the players positioned in the center of both teams began to increase.

- From the 20th minute of the first half, the tempo of the offense and defense exchanged by both teams has completely changed.

- They keep counterattacking, and counterattacking, and counterattacking again!

- As I speak, Ethan Blacksmith! Surviving Arsenal's pressure and sending a long pass forward!

- Karon Connelly! It's a good opportunity!

- He takes the ball and shoots!

- Ahhhhh! How could he miss this? How?

A crisis situation that emerged momentarily.

With a sharp pass from Ethan Blacksmith, Arsenal's defense was breached, and Brighton's forward Karon Connelly took a shot as he penetrated through the gap.

It was a perilous situation for Arsenal.

But Karon Connelly, who had a perfect opportunity, made a shot that missed the goal by a wide margin, leaving Brighton's home fans in despair.

“Ahhhhh!”

“Karon, no! What good is it if he penetrates so well? His finishing is a mess!”

“Two years ago, he used to score at least 10 goals in the league, why has he changed so much?”

Clearly, Brighton showed fatal moves in the stages leading to the finish.

Arsenal's midfield and defense fell completely apart due to Brighton's movements.

But.

The finishing was too weak.

Football fans could understand from this scene why the talk of changing the offensive line was emerging.

Conversely, despite Arsenal showing more struggle than expected against Brighton, they managed to score their second goal in the 31st minute of the first half.

Tyler Smith-Rowe's cross was neatly headed in by Lorenzo Lupo, making it 2-0.

- Gooooooooal!

- Arsenal easily pulls ahead! Brighton may be dominating the overall performance, but the score is 2-0 in Arsenal's favor!

- I think it’s a difference in finishing ability. Brighton’s class doesn’t seem significantly lower than Arsenal’s.

- Brighton’s 15 goals in the league are the same as Minho’s goals this season.

The difference between Brighton and Arsenal was so simple that even a seven-year-old could understand it, given that the team’s total goals matched Park Minho’s individual tally of 15 goals after scoring the opening goal.

It ultimately came down to finishing.

- Brighton has no choice but to rely on this player.

- That’s right. Ethan Blacksmith was the player who scored the second-most goals in the team last season.

Brighton fans’ attention inevitably turned to Ethan.

They believed he could change the current pattern.

And indeed, Ethan made the Gooners' hearts race with his performance, living up to their expectations.

- Ethan! Shoots!

- A surprise shot from a considerable distance by Ethan Blacksmith! Arsenal’s goalkeeper, Marlon Ramsdale, barely punches it away!

- Cleared to the side by Craig Martin! Brighton continues their offensive with a corner kick.

But even such offensives cannot defy time.

As soon as the referee signaled the end of the first half.

Just like the blazing flame that pushed Arsenal, Brighton’s players’ movements came to a halt.

Thus, the first half ended with a score of 2-0.

* * *

Coach Steven Gerrard had built the team well.

Brighton’s player composition and tactical movements were on par with other Big Six teams.

No wonder Tyler once said, ‘We could replace Tottenham with Brighton in the Big Six.’

Brighton’s organization and tactics were enough to challenge us, the league leaders.

However, the reason Brighton was in mid-table despite having such a formidable squad could also be seen in the first half.

“It wasn’t bad. It felt like the opponent had prepared a lot against us. Seeing that Brighton took 14 shots against us in the first half, it’s clear their coach prepared a lot against us.”

“But… only 4 out of those 14 shots were on target.”

Overall, Brighton’s metrics were better, but they lacked substance.

Thanks to this, despite having only 7 shots in the first half, we were leading 2-0.

“The number of shots is twice as much, but the number of shots on target is the same, 4. Coach Gerrard must be having a headache. I wish that stress would make him lose some hair, though…”

It seemed our coach felt a subtle jealousy towards Coach Gerrard’s abundant hair.

“What we need to do in the second half remains the same. The opponent will come at us with stronger pressure and a high defensive line.”

“We will match their movements until the 20th minute of the second half, then target Brighton’s back space as their stamina wanes. Minho will move to the front line, and Lorenzo will deliver the ball from the second line to make the most of counterattacks. Got it?”

The players nodded at Coach Alain’s words.

Thus began the second half.

As our coach predicted, Brighton maintained strong pressure and a high defensive line while continuing their offensive.

- Brighton doesn’t want to end it like this! They want to gain points at their home and prepare for the upcoming 4 away games.

- As I speak, Ethan Blacksmith! Connecting a long pass! Turning to the center, Luciano!

- Luciano’s shot! Ahhh! The ball flies high again! What is this, Brighton?

It was highly likely that Brighton’s forwards had triangle-shaped soccer shoes.

Otherwise, there was no reason for them to keep overshooting the goal.

“What do you think of my opinion?”

“It makes sense.”

During a corner kick situation.

A brief respite.

I shared my opinion with Lorenzo next to me, and he nodded in agreement.

In the ensuing corner kick situation, Ethan Blacksmith’s cleanly lifted corner kick landed precisely on the head of Brighton’s forward, Toby Madueke.

Everyone was confident it was a goal, but Toby Madueke’s header was inaccurate.

The ball went over the goal.

Watching this, Lorenzo spoke to me.

“That guy’s head must be triangular too.”

Indeed.

Seeing him miss something so easy, it might really be triangular.

* * *

- Brighton keeps shaking Arsenal’s defense, but there’s no clear result.

- As I speak, Minho’s counterattack!

- George Holding, who momentarily lost Minho, quickly catches up! But Minho! He’s fast! Minho! Minho! Minho! Minhooooo! Goooooooal!

- With a single counterattack in the second half, Arsenal extends the lead to 3-0!

As always.

In football, the team that scores wins.

No matter how incredible the performance, without scoring goals, victory cannot be achieved.

Brighton certainly had many good chances.

If I were Brighton’s forward, I would have scored at least 3 goals already; Brighton’s forwards were that serious.

- Brighton substitutes defensive midfielder Ian Rocca with Baizel Carbonik.

- This means… Ethan Blacksmith moves down in front of the central defenders.

- It seems they plan to use Ethan’s long passes to shake Arsenal’s flanks.

- That’s right. And Ethan Blacksmith, who has decent defensive skills, can help the defense.

Brighton added another forward.

Seeing Coach Gerrard loudly urging the team to step up showed that Brighton hadn’t given up yet.

It was clear that Brighton’s performance was better than ours.

But.

The score difference was now 3.

I was one goal away from a hat-trick.

What does that mean?

“One goal left.”

Yes, one goal left.

While lurking near Brighton’s defensive line, looking for an opportunity, I watched Ethan Blacksmith.

Positioned between the central defenders spread out for build-up, Ethan was leisurely moving the ball while delivering deadly passes to threaten Arsenal.

It was clear that whether in the second or third line, he was a significant threat to the opponent.

Even when I pressed hard several times, Ethan Blacksmith calmly held the ball and escaped the pressure.

A little over 30 minutes into the second half.

Brighton was showing signs of impatience.

Realizing time was slipping away, they moved more boldly to shake Arsenal.

After fierce resistance from Arsenal, Brighton passed the ball back to the defender George Holding.

And as the ball connected to the central Ethan Blacksmith, something happened.

For the first time in today’s game, he made a ball touch mistake.

Though it reminded me of past games, I didn’t hesitate and rushed forward to get the ball and ran.

Ethan Blacksmith, who had slipped, struggled to crawl back at me, but the ball had already left my foot and passed Brighton’s goalkeeper Miguel Sanchez.

As soon as I recorded a hat-trick, lying on the ground like Demba Ba, I could feel the booing from Brighton fans pouring down on me.

Boooooooooooooooooo!

The boos were intense enough to be a little frightening.

But there was nothing I could do.

Seeing such a mistake firsthand and not making such a provocation… Well, that wouldn’t be manly, I was sure of it.

* * *

- Brighton needs to stay focused on defense.

- That’s right. Offense isn’t everything… Ah! What is this!

- Minho intercepts and moves forward!

- Minho! One-on-one with the goalkeeper! Minho!

- Minhooooo! Goooooooal!

- Arsenal scores their fourth goal! Arsenal extends the lead to 4-0!

- Arsenal was slightly dragged throughout the second half, but here, Ethan made a fatal mistake.

- Ethan Blacksmith commits a critical error.

- Brighton’s rising star Ethan lost concentration at the end of the second half.

- Minho records a hat-trick at Amex Stadium!

- And the player who made the mistake was Brighton’s star and main character, Ethan Blacksmith.

- Ah! Reviewing this, he lost the ball and fell here.

- This is truly a critical error, right?

- That’s right. And Minho did not miss the one-on-one chance.

Park Minho scored a hat-trick.

And the scene was strikingly similar to a certain player’s dark past, drawing everyone’s attention.

Naturally, in Korea, the scene evoked memories, leading to a virtual explosion in overseas soccer communities.

Some communities were so overwhelmed with traffic that they became inaccessible.

[Comments]

- Humba Humba!

- Hahahahahahahaha

- It’s here! Haha, of all places, this scene replays right in front of Coach Steven Gerrard!

- Haha

- If Ethan Blacksmith’s name was really ‘Bongbufaka,’ he’d be rotting in the second division.

- Seriously… it’s so similar.

- Demba Ba, are you watching? Here’s the successor of Humba Humba becoming someone’s loyal dog.

- Haha, he whined so much about wanting to go to Liverpool, and now look at Ethan Blacksmith.

- Even the commentary sounds exactly like back then.

- Humba… watching from the sky, right?

- Not the sky, haha, he’s grabbing his head in the technical area.

- Liverpool fans, unexpected demise.

- Liverpool fans watching Brighton’s game got an electric shock as they recalled the 13-14 season.

The game ended with Arsenal’s 4-0 victory.

A near-perfect hat-trick that shattered Brighton’s will to chase.

[Park Minho Hat-trick! Leads Arsenal to a 4-0 Victory!]

[Good Performance, Disappointing Finishing! Brighton Needs a Skilled Forward!]

[Arsenal Maintains League Lead! Gunner’s Rejoice Over Impressive Season!]

[Robin van Persie, ‘Minho Reminds Me of Myself.’]

[Gunners, ‘Minho isn’t a Half-Season Player Like You.’]

[Coach Steven Gerrard, ‘Ethan Will Overcome This. He’s a Good Player Who Can Anchor Brighton.’]

[Ethan Blacksmith, ‘It Was the Worst Performance. I Apologize to the Fans Who Came to Watch.’]

Articles poured in as soon as the game ended.

And in Korea, posts about Park Minho, who played in today’s game, quickly surfaced in the community.

[Title: Park Minho is a Player Who’s Underrated Because of His Name.]

-Content-

Honestly, if Park Minho were from Argentina and named ‘Lionel Minho’ or from Brazil and named ‘Parque Minho,’ the European soccer world would have gone crazy about him since his Parma days, giving him Puskas awards and placing him on Ballon d'Or podiums.

The media is surprisingly quiet considering his skill level.

Honestly, he faces a lot of discrimination because he’s Korean and Asian, but with his current skills, he’s enough to rival past Ronaldo or Messi.

Does it make sense that someone like Ethan Blacksmith is tied with Park Minho in the Ballon d'Or top 20?

Moreover, it’s ridiculous that he always comes in second place for the Puskas Award.

So shout it out.

Park Minho is God.

Reading the post, Monica’s eyes sparkled.

She thought this post was right.

[Comments]

- MinhoArsenalForever: If Minho had Italian or English nationality, he’d already be called a god of soccer!

Becoming familiar with Korean and Hangul to the level of a Korean, she left a comment on the post with a contented smile.

“See, Korea truly recognizes Minho’s worth?”

Monica nodded.

Yes, to her, Minho was the god of soccer.
