## 35. Monica's Happiness Arsenal (1)

Lorenzo Lupo was happy.

When he transferred to Arsenal last season, how hard did he work to score his Premier League debut goal?

It took him six matches to score his first goal.

This season?

He scored his first goal in the opening match.

His performance was on a whole different level compared to last season.

[Where did the Arsenal we knew go?]

[3-0 shutout against Man Utd! Arsenal has changed!]

[Mino-Lorenzo Lupo-Tyler Smith Rowe! The powerful offensive force of Arsenal's triangle!]

[Five reasons to watch the 23-24 Premier League season!]

The media was abuzz with their excellent performance.

But there was still a bit of unease.

The team’s atmosphere still felt disjointed, with the existing veterans and young players continuing to clash.

However, after the match with Man Utd, the sight of some young players rallying around Park Minho was promising.

Of course, it was just the beginning.

Only the first game of the season had just ended.

There might still be moments this season when Arsenal shows poor performance and collapses.

But.

Lorenzo was certain they wouldn’t show the same helplessness as last season.

* * *

The second round of the Premier League was against Liverpool.

Liverpool.

Last season’s Champions League winner.

Though they didn’t achieve a double or treble, having lost the league to Manchester City, the League Cup to Chelsea, and the FA Cup to Newcastle.

But by lifting the Big Ear, Liverpool reestablished themselves as Europe’s top team.

I think Liverpool is one of the strongest squads in the Premier League.

Of course, their form has declined compared to the past.

It’s true that the main players are aging and their skills are slightly declining, and their young replacements have yet to fully bloom.

However, the current Arsenal is not a team to be taken lightly.

There’s a reason Arsenal couldn’t win a single match against Liverpool last season.

Still, I believe we have a chance to win.

Our squad is quite formidable.

Yes, we have a good chance to win.

The problem is our manager plans to use about half of the rotation members in this match.

This isn’t necessarily a bad choice.

Parma also used rotation members gradually at the start of the season, improving their form.

And during the tight mid-to-late season, they effectively managed the squad’s stamina by rotating players.

The issue was that the opponent was Liverpool.

Would it be okay to miss some key players?

I was worried, but the level of the rotation members was better than I thought.

The opponent wasn’t at full strength either.

The main goalkeeper, Alisson Becker, was out until the fourth round due to injury, and the attacker they splurged on last winter, Miguel Luis, was silent.

Additionally, Jonathan Henderson and Michael Robertson couldn’t start in the opening match due to preseason injuries, so there was some hope.

“Is it a dream that Arsenal has Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli as backups?”

“Bernard Partey is also a backup.”

“Team White and Daniel Saliba are backups too.”

“This season... Can we expect something?”

On my way to work, I overheard Arsenal fans discussing their expectations for this match at a shop.

As I entered the training ground, Lorenzo Lupo and Bruno Campos greeted me.

“How’s your body?”

“Can you score a hat-trick in tomorrow’s match?”

These guys seem to think I’m some kind of goal-scoring machine.

“You are a goal-scoring machine, aren’t you?”

“I haven’t seen anyone score as well as Mino, except for Messi and Ronaldo.”

It was a bit creepy.

It felt like they were reading my mind.

More than that, I didn’t know they rated me so highly.

Well, I can understand Bruno.

We’ve faced each other quite a bit in matches against AC Milan.

But I couldn’t understand where Lorenzo Lupo’s belief in me came from.

Well, looking into his trust-filled eyes, I felt it would be hard to get a proper answer even if I asked.

Anyway.

After greeting these guys and other players, we started the morning training.

But... It felt like someone was missing.

Moreover, a new face caught my eye.

As I looked around with a puzzled expression, the captain, Tyrone Tierney, approached and cleared up my confusion.

“Calver went to Monaco for a medical test.”

“Ah... So he’s finally transferring?”

Calver Sambi Lokonga.

After transferring from Anderlecht, he had been a useful backup midfielder at Arsenal, but it seemed he decided to transfer to AS Monaco.

His performance in training wasn’t bad.

But it seemed he wasn’t happy with the idea of spending another season as a backup.

Considering the fierce competition in this season’s Arsenal, I could somewhat understand Calver’s feelings.

So, the ones who leave, leave.

Now, I turned my attention to the new player joining the team.

His name was Jake Francis.

An Irish player, he was quite young and belonged to the same faction as Armani Richards.

After the preseason, he was sent down to the second team, but with Calver transferring, he seemed to be called up to fill the spot.

Well, his skills weren’t bad.

Though he had many technical shortcomings, he was a player who ran a lot and felt dedicated.

He seemed likely to step on the field as a substitute.

After the morning training ended.

In the evening, there was official news that Liverpool had signed defensive midfielder Semino Rodriguez.

“Semino? The guy who played in Spain?”

“He was with Real Hispalis, right? I heard he’s a pretty tough guy... So, he’s moved to Liverpool.”

“Liverpool also signed Richard Ward-Prowse from Southampton, they’re really strengthening their central resources this season.”

As we ate lunch, the players shared their thoughts on the transfer news and moved on to talk about the next day’s match.

Having bad memories from last season against Liverpool, the players were determined to win this home match.

* * *

The Premier League second-round match, with both teams fielding about 1.5 squads, was held at Arsenal’s home.

Monica visited the Emirates Stadium for the first time in a while.

Thanks to Park Minho, she got a seat in the VIP section, allowing her to watch the game from a spot where she could see the entire field.

As she sat down, she put an earphone in one ear and started listening to the Premier League commentary.

- Unlike the first round of the Premier League, there are significant changes in the squads of both Arsenal and Liverpool for today’s match.

- That’s right. Arsenal’s manager Alain Levagne is known for frequently rotating players to manage the main players' stamina from the start of the season, as he did in Serie A.

- Liverpool has recovered some of their squad with Michael Robertson and Jonathan Henderson starting this match after missing the preseason due to injuries.

Premier League second round.

Arsenal vs. Liverpool.

It was an important match that would set the tone for the early season, so Monica tightly gripped her Arsenal scarf and prayed.

- However, looking at both teams' squads, it doesn’t feel like these are rotation members.

- Yes, it means both teams have solid squads.

Of course, it was true that all the players who passed through Arsenal were good players.

But hearing that Arsenal’s squad was solid was the first compliment Monica had heard since becoming an Arsenal fan.

“This makes me even more excited.”

Monica mumbled as she looked at the field.

Just then, the players entered the field.

The first player that caught her eye was Park Minho, wearing the number 10 jersey.

“Mino...!”

She never imagined Park Minho would become a football player.

Though she somewhat expected she would date him after he came to study in Italy.

Anyway.

She was very happy now.

Her boyfriend was a world-class striker.

Arsenal had signed her boyfriend, raising expectations for this season.

Just like that expectation, Arsenal had a great start with a 3-0 victory against Man Utd in the opening match.

She quietly watched the field, hoping for a similar performance in this match.

The match started with the referee's whistle.

The Gunners filling the Emirates Stadium sang cheers, calling for their team’s victory.

- Liverpool has fielded a forward trio of Miguel Luis, Fabio Mane, and Abraham Salah.

- Manager Jurgen Klopp has certainly put out a strong card in the attack.

Liverpool dominated the early part of the match.

With their characteristic pressing, Liverpool created a crisis for Arsenal just four minutes into the first half, making Monica’s heart sink.

- Salah’s shot misses!

- Salah! Mane! And back to Salah from Miguel Luis! It was a fantastic combination by Liverpool!

- Ramsdale the goalkeeper shouts! That crisis came from Casper Nielsen losing his mark.

Casper Nielsen, the 20-year-old fullback, nodded with a determined expression as he returned to his position.

Liverpool’s two proud wingers were showing an overwhelming performance, making it hard for Arsenal to stay focused.

Last season’s Arsenal would have continued to falter under Liverpool’s offensive and conceded the first goal, leading to a natural collapse.

But not this season.

As Liverpool’s fierce offensive momentarily paused, Bruno Campos stole the ball and launched a counterattack.

- Bukayo Saka! He’s got the ball and he’s running!

- He’s fast! Mino is on the opposite side! Gabriel Martinelli is in the center forward position!

If Tyler Smith Rowe felt like a playmaker placed on the flank, Bukayo Saka was a dribbler with excellent ball control and body balance.

As he quickly advanced with the ball, Michael Robertson closely marked him.

But dribbling wasn’t Saka’s only strength.

Another of Saka’s strengths, clean passing, followed.

- Saka moves to the center!

- Gabriel in the center passes back to Saka!

- Saka! He outmaneuvers Robertson and sends a high cross! To the opposite side, Minooooooo!

- Ohhhh! What a save by Stefan Bürki!

- Stefan Bürki, the backup goalkeeper, is filling in well for the injured Alisson Becker!

With Alisson Becker out due to injury, backup goalkeeper Stefan Bürki started and cleanly saved Park Minho’s shot, causing a sigh at the Emirates Stadium.

Ahhhhh!

As Arsenal’s sharp counterattack made it difficult for Liverpool to push their defense line forward, both teams' attacks became somewhat stagnant.

Manager Jurgen Klopp shouted at the overly cautious Liverpool defense.

“Push up more! Don’t be afraid! Show Liverpool’s football! Press harder!”

Of course, he knew it wasn’t easy advice for the players.

But once they sat back against that monstrous attack, it would be Liverpool who would fall behind.

That’s how Serie A teams lost control to Parma and collapsed.

And as Liverpool came out more aggressively, Arsenal matched them, raising their line.

Thanks to that, the match, which had been stagnant until the 20th minute of the first half, suddenly shifted to a fast tempo with long passes aimed at open spaces.

Naturally, it was fun for the fans watching.

A match between strong teams with quick transitions between offense and defense.

The first goal came from Liverpool, as expected.

- Goooooooal!

- Last season’s league top scorer Salah scores his second goal of the league, giving Liverpool the lead!

- Ah! Salah was too much for the young fullback Casper Nielsen to handle.

Salah broke through Arsenal’s shaky left side, charged straight into the half-space, and took a clean shot, scoring the first goal for Liverpool.

Monica gripped her Arsenal scarf tightly and shouted.

“Ah! Please! Please! When will this jerk stop playing for Liverpool? Please, move to Real Madrid!”

A chilled Emirates Stadium.

Monica sat back down and sighed deeply, shaking her head.

She thought again that Liverpool was not an easy team.

A very tough team for Arsenal to face.

Just as she was about to give up, a huge cheer erupted at the Emirates Stadium.

Even her earphones filled with the commentators' screams and shouts.

- Goooooooal! Minooooooo!

- A fantastic long-range shot from a considerable distance! The match is back to 1-1!

- A fantastic long-range shot just 20 seconds after the restart!

- Mino’s long-range shot with the outside of his foot swerves and hits the net! It was a trajectory that the goalkeeper couldn’t save!

Only then did Monica look back at the field and see Park Minho, who had scored, sliding towards her direction.

Naturally, the once gloomy Monica switched her mood like a character from an AOS game and rejoiced.

Of course, she didn’t forget to spin the Arsenal scarf in her right hand.

“Minooooooo! Arsenal! Let’s go for the league title! Make some noise!”

“This is happy football! Kyaaaa! Mino, you’re the best! I love you, Mino!”

An elderly man nearby muttered, calling Monica a ‘half-crazy woman.’

She wasn’t a normal Arsenal fan.

She was a Gooner in a state of madness.

“Kyaaaaaaa!”

The elderly man thought.

He didn’t know who this crazy woman would marry, but he was sure her poor husband would definitely need a hearing aid at an early age.
