## 17. Professor Park Minho! (4)

Due to my lack of experience, many things that can happen on the field always amaze me.

In that sense, it was quite astonishing to see Sunbae Shin Junseo's goal within less than a minute at the start of today's match.

Although there have been many teams that conceded goals due to my sudden sprints, this was the first time I saw a goal scored in less than a minute.

Sometimes I think about this:

What if I had consistently played football?

Where might I be at my current age?

Perhaps, I wouldn't have been as successful as I am now.

I might have become arrogant.

I wouldn't have poured everything into football like I do now.

Being young, I might have indulged in alcohol and various entertainments, neglecting training as I do now.

There are so many things in the world that can distract a young player from focusing on the sport of football.

Maybe it was fate arranged by the god of football.

"Alright! Let's take it step by step! Think of it as 0-0!"

At Shin Junseo sunbae's words, the players' eyes changed.

Facing the formidable Germany, we were a bit intimidated when we stepped onto the field, but upon playing against them, we realized that there were more gaps than we thought.

However, if you ask whether South Korea dominated Germany, honestly, we were getting hammered quite a bit.

They are fierce.

Really fierce.

-Germany! After being struck right at the start, they are persistently attacking South Korea's left side!

-Kim Youngsoo! He gets penetrated again!

The opponent targeted Sunbae Kim Youngsoo, who has recently been in a slump.

The young winger from Munich.

Tamal Musiala especially destroyed our left side, creating several good chances.

Fortunately, we haven't conceded a goal yet.

Dae! Han! Min! Guk!

Clap clap clap! Clap clap!

You can hear the voices of those who followed us all the way to Germany or the Korean residents living in Germany.

The cheers are as passionate as those from Parma.

Hearing such cheers, we can't afford to lose.

"Minho!"

Sunbae Lee Jaesung's pass flies towards me.

After quickly catching the ball, I pushed it to the side.

Anyway, our goal today is Germany's flank, consisting of Dieter Baku and Tobin Gosens.

As soon as Shin Junseo sunbae grabs the ball, he runs.

That speed was much faster than mine.

Watching him outpace someone in an instant reminded me once again how crucial physicality is in football.

Of course, a player with only physicality would be weeded out.

Shin Junseo sunbae wasn't that kind of player.

Boom!

-Shin Junseoooooo!

-Oh! A perfect save by goalie Kamiel Neuer!

-In the 17th minute of the first half, South Korea finally took a shot and created a good opportunity.

What a shame.

If it weren't for Kamiel Neuer, wouldn't that ball have gone in?

It's a bit disappointing.

Still, the match is more manageable than I thought.

"Minho!"

Sunbae Shin Junseo calls my name again.

Come to think of it, sunbae has been calling my name tirelessly throughout today's match.

The German defense, reading his shout, became tense.

At times like this, it's best to use sunbae as bait.

I turned my gaze to the opposite side.

Jung Yoohyuk, playing in Germany, was looking at me from a pretty good position.

Alright, this time it's Jung Yoohyuk.

Boom!

A perfectly delivered pass.

For a moment, the German defense wavered.

I was sure.

This is a goal.

But I had to understand why Sunbae Shin Junseo was calling my name so much.

-Ahhhhhh! Jung Yoohyuk! The ball went too high!

-A perfect chance goes to waste! It was a perfect pass behind the defender, wasn’t it?

-Kamiel the goalkeeper couldn't even position himself... Ah! Jung Yoohyuk misses this!

63 Building Breakthrough Shot.

I named that shot like this.

No, how could he miss that?

It was truly a perfect opportunity.

You could tell by looking at the German defense.

The moment my pass went through.

Maximilian Ginter had already given up.

Bird Zule was coming in with a tackle from behind to stop it by any means.

That great opportunity was wasted.

Even Keneth wouldn't have missed that chance.

But because the team's atmosphere is important.

I quietly gave a thumbs-up.

Seeing that, Jung Yoohyuk smiled.

No, don't smile.

If I get attached, I can't scold you at halftime.

* * *

"Damn it!"

Coach Florian grabbed his head.

The pass just now was chilling.

Germany's back four was rendered powerless in an instant.

If Jung Yoohyuk had scored, the score would have widened to 2-0, leading to the worst situation.

"Focus! On the flanks! Run more!"

As the defense wobbled, the team's tempo got disrupted.

Thanks to that, South Korea seized the initiative.

Just one pass changed the atmosphere.

"That's why I assigned Jens Weigl to Minho!"

His football IQ is high.

His defensive use of space and ball handling skills were outstanding, so I assigned him to mark Park Minho.

At the very least, I didn't want to absurdly allow such a ridiculous pass.

But we couldn't stop him.

That damn Korean was targeting Germany's most vulnerable spots, showing off sharp passes.

"Damn it..."

It's frustrating.

Coach Florian, usually cold-headed.

But if his team failed to show their own colors, he would scold the players like a mad dog.

However, he wasn't just a coach who only yelled at players.

On the outside, he looked like he was about to kill someone, but in his mind, he was calmly thinking about who to send out in the second half.

Oouuu!

Then another chance came.

If South Korea’s attacker hadn’t made a mistake again, Germany's defense would have been shaken.

His gaze inevitably focused on Park Minho.

‘No matter how well I thought he was doing.’

I didn't think it was to this level.

Why is there such a player in the South Korean team?

At the same time, he had this thought.

How amazing is Serie B.

To have only conceded 71 attack points to this monstrous player?

It was a bit confusing.

In the situation just past the 20th minute of the first half, the player who chilled Germany's spine was none other than Park Minho.

Even Shin Junseo wasn’t this scary.

Without good passes connecting to him, he couldn’t show off his strengths to the fullest.

That's why Park Minho was scarier.

"Still, we can't end it like this."

He fiddled with the early substitution card.

Anyway, one of the players placed in the midfield had just recovered from an injury and needed to be managed.

Past the 25th minute of the first half.

The card Coach Florian pulled out was 'Kkammo' from Real Madrid, a player nicknamed the Professor.

It was Tommy Kroos.

* * *

Our free kick chance.

The game is paused.

Tweet!

Ah, Germany is making a substitution first.

Teon Goretzka, who was doing nothing in the center, is out, and Tommy Kroos is in.

Finally, the German professor steps onto the field.

He looked at me and smiled.

The way I’m playing now must resemble how Tommy Kroos played in the second line, so it seemed like he was reacting to that.

But Tommy Kroos approached me.

Oh, I can't speak German or Spanish.

I wonder what to say.

But Tommy Kroos spoke first.

It seemed he knew some basic English.

He started talking abruptly.

"Real Madrid, good club. Play together."

"Win, play. We winner. We champion."

He bragged about his club.

Then he invited me to join him.

I roughly understood that he was asking me to play together at Real Madrid.

Play at Real Madrid?

It's not a place I can go just because he says so.

Tommy Kroos seemed to say it too easily.

I replied with simple words.

"Nope."

Well, what more is there to explain.

Real Madrid is not it.

Even if I go later, now is not the time.

Hearing my words, Tommy Kroos looked at me with a disappointed expression and then smiled.

Then he returned to his position.

That guy is really something else.

Suddenly asking me to come to Real Madrid.

Just because he asks, do you think I can go easily?

"Minho! Should I take it?"

Sunbae Shin Junseo asks.

Sunbae Shin Junseo's left foot has been sharp today.

Should I trust him?

But thinking of the other players who wasted several good opportunities in the previous situations.

I strangely lose trust.

But sunbae Shin Junseo is different.

Yeah, the ace of Tottenham is different.

"Please."

At my words, sunbae Shin Junseo nodded.

-Shin Junseo prepares for the free kick.

-His left foot's precision has been great today, right?

-He scored the first goal with his left foot.

With the referee's whistle, sunbae Shin Junseo ran towards the ball and swung his left foot wide.

Boom!

A sharply curving ball.

Goalkeeper Kamiel flew and deflected the ball.

It was a perfect trajectory.

This time, it was the goalkeeper who did too well.

The ball went to Germany's possession.

South Korea quickly attempted to press.

But now Germany had the professor who could create the most dangerous passes in counterattacks.

-The ball connects to Tommy Kroos!

-A long pass! Ah! Dangerous! Dangerous!

-Teo Werner catches the ball!

An accurate pass landed right at the foot of Germany's forward Teo Werner.

Teo Werner, who wasn't one to miss chances given to him, like in his club Chelsea.

Although he had been struggling in the national team before Coach Florian used him.

Since the World Cup qualifiers to now, Teo Werner has been scoring consistently in every match.

Running at nearly 35 km/h, he bypassed South Korea's goalkeeper Sunbae Roh Donghyuk and scored, bringing the game to a 1-1 tie.

-Goal! Germany equalizes in the 27th minute of the first half!

-What a shame! The Taeguk Warriors were maintaining a good atmosphere until mid-first half, weren't they?

Really... The pass was different.

I couldn't help but be amazed.

Now I understand why Real Madrid is still struggling to find a replacement for 'Kkammo'.

Well, it's better than Barcelona.

They still have Busquets.

That's elderly abuse.

But isn’t Modric older?

Still, Real Madrid has some replacements, so they might manage.

Anyway.

Tommy Kroos is different.

With just one pass, you could understand why he is evaluated as the world's top-class midfielder with the best deep-lying playmaking ability.

As expected.

Germany is different.

With just one player change, the team's atmosphere shifted.

That's why we should have scored another goal.

I have a bad feeling.

But what can you do?

You have to run like crazy.

The first half has a little over 10 minutes left.

The game isn't even halfway through.

Yeah, to make a comeback, you have to run like crazy.

Right?

-Roughly a photo of a stressed professor.

-A photo of the professor getting stiff.

-A photo of Maximilian Ginter looking at the professor with a pitiful expression.

-A photo of goalkeeper Kamiel Neuer staring intently at Hwang Yoohyun's foot, wondering if this attacker has triangular feet.

[Comments]

-ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-Wow... The 63 Building Breakthrough Shot is really detestable.

-Professor Park Minho, I'm sorry.

-The Korean attackers who wasted 4 crucial passes should all bow their heads in shame.

An unexpectedly thrilling match.

Watching Park Minho create opportunities out of nothing and the Korean attackers wasting them, the comment section was exploding.

-Even Shin Junseo?

-Sunbae Shin Junseo, go... away!

-???: Thank you... Minho!

-Shin Junseo is smiling all by himself.

-Of course. Getting passes as good as Tommy Kroos' from the national team must make him smile.

-Football must be really fun.

-???: Is this... football? What have I been playing all this time?

Simultaneously, under the title 'Professor Park Minho and the Failing Students', gifs of the 4 killer passes made by Park Minho being wasted by the Korean players were popular in the trending tab.

There were also posts comparing Shin Junseo’s usual frowning face in the national team and his bright smile in today's match, making the comment section even more active.

[Title: The Biggest Idiot Right Now]

<Content>

Gennaro Tatis, who scored only 21 goals with Professor Park in Parma, making South Korea compete with Germany.

-ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Parma's attackers are detestable tooㅋㅋㅋ

-ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ If you can’t score 30 goals with Professor Park, you’re not a strikerㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

-Seriously, how can you not score 30 goals in a season with passes from Park Minho?

-Minho! Please come to AT Madrid!

-What? Minho? Correct it to Professor Park.

As the first half was nearing its end.

Fans who thought the first half would end 1-1 began to talk about the three most active players in South Korea.

Park Minho, Shin Junseo, and Lee Minjun, shifting the conversation to the second half.

And just past the 44th minute of the first half.

At a moment when the fans’ concentration was waning, the ball connected to Park Minho’s foot.

And.

South Korea’s counterattack began.

* * *

I received the ball near the halfway line.

Honestly, I didn’t expect much, but.

Our Junshik’s pass was amazing.

Though he is criticized for being slow and weak in physical battles at a young age.

Honestly, I think the player with the highest pass completion rate in South Korea after me is Lee Junshik.

"Minho!"

Our Sunbae Shin Junseo raises his hand again.

That means he is confident.

And also that my passes are well-matched.

Passing to Sunbae Lee Daesung, who was rising high, then receiving the ball back, I bypassed Kenny Havertz.

Today everything is going well.

I saw Jens Weigl rushing in.

This time I bypassed him with individual skill.

Since I had been focusing on passing throughout the first half, Jens Weigl was taken aback when I suddenly rushed in.

I didn’t miss that part.

-Park Minho! Bypassing Jens Weigl with a step over and moving to the center!

-There’s an open space in front!

-Sunbae Shin Junseo is there! In a good position!

Wow.

That position is killer.

If I pass, it will certainly be a good chance.

But.

I didn’t pass.

I’m sorry, Sunbae Shin Junseo.

This time, I wanted to be a bit selfish.

-Park Minho! Going deeper!

-Birde Zule is blocking the front!

He’s a good player.

He doesn’t easily give up space, which is troublesome, but.

Today, he has shown a slight lack of concentration.

Probably because he’s a young defender.

Big mistakes often come out.

Like now.

-Park Minho! Breaking Bird Zule! As Bird Zule slips, he hurriedly follows!

Bird Zule slipped and fell.

It’s a scene reminiscent of someone.

Being fooled by my feint, Bird Zule used both his feet and hands to hurriedly catch up.

-Park Minho! Park Minho! Entering the danger zone!

-Goalkeeper Kamiel Neuer! Slowly closing the distance! Reducing Park Minho’s shooting angle!

-One-on-one chance with the goalkeeper! Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho! Goaaaaaaallll!

-South Korea scores again in the 45th minute of the first half, taking a 2-1 lead!

Wahhhhhhhh!

Hearing the loud cheers from the compatriots who witnessed my brilliant individual skill celebrating my goal.

Sunbae Shin Junseo also ran over with a wide smile.

From afar, Coach Pedro, who was sitting on the bench, threw the water bottle he was drinking and started hopping around.

-Ah! Bird Zule, who had been defending well throughout the first half, makes a crucial mistake here!

-Bird Zule! Too complacent! He lost his focus too easily in this situation!

-Yes, he was fooled by Park Minho’s light feint and slipped, leading to a critical mistake that resulted in conceding a goal, widening the score to 2-1!

Waving to the compatriots, I glanced at Bird Zule, who had sat down.

He seemed mentally shaken.

Honestly.

I felt a bit sorry for Bird Zule.

I was reminded of someone in his current state.

Bird Zule might get mocked for this scene in Korea for a while.

So.

Why not change your name later?

That hmm... never mind.

I should stop here.

I’m afraid of getting sued if I say more.
