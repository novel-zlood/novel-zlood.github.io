## 44. Lorenzo is Unstoppable! (2)

Ah... I shouldn't have provoked him just because I felt good after scoring a goal.

Lorenzo, who got all worked up by my words, started his rampage.

Lorenzo, who started passing with volleys like a maniac, couldn't be stopped by anyone.

The problem was that even though his passes weren't that good, they were surprisingly accurate when he hit them as volleys.

"Volley pass!"

The pass from Lorenzo didn't even touch the ground and continued with one-touch passes, naturally speeding up our attack tempo.

Newcastle's defense couldn't adapt to Lorenzo's antics and started running around frantically.

"Volley header!"

No... that's just a header.

Sometimes, it feels like I'm playing soccer with a 7-year-old kid.

I can't keep up with this guy's tempo at all.

Still, connecting the ball with volleys is kind of fun.

As I frequently exchanged short one-touch passes with Lorenzo, Newcastle's defender, Philippe Badiashile, who was following me, shouted angrily.

"You're playing soccer like crap!"

Oh! What a compliment.

Thanks to that, I feel even more energized.

-Arsenal is shaking up Newcastle's defense with very concise passing in the attack.

-They're exchanging short passes at a very fast pace. Although there are some inaccurate passes, this fast tempo doesn't suit Newcastle's sluggish defensive line with poor direction-changing ability and slow feet.

If Lautaro Valentia, my former teammate from Parma and a prince syndrome patient, were here, it might be different, but he's currently injured and can't even sit on the bench.

Newcastle's coach Isaac Enrique must be frustrated.

Due to Newcastle's overall sluggish defense, they can't easily push the line up.

-Minho! Passes short to Lorenzo!

-Lorenzo! Shooooot! Ah! Fantastic save by goalkeeper Martin Dubravka!

-The following second ball! Minho! Minho! Shooooot! Gooooooal!

-Another half-volley goal!

-Minhooooooo!

Lorenzo's half-volley shot hit the goalkeeper's hand and fell near me, so I just swung my foot at it.

With this, the score quickly widened to 3-1, and I ran towards the away fans to share the joy of scoring with them.

"Hahahaha! Minhoooooo!"

"Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!"

"C'moooon!"

Meanwhile, Lorenzo, who seemed quite displeased with missing the half-volley shot, was glaring at the opposing goalkeeper.

"Why does he only block my shots...?"

Honestly, he had a reason to feel wronged.

The shot Lorenzo just took was incredible, but that goalkeeper made an insane save.

However, he couldn't stop my volley shot aiming for the second ball. He was already off balance.

I felt like I had scored a free goal.

I wish we could play soccer like this every day.

Then I could score a hat-trick every match.

"Minho, wipe that smug look off your face."

Oops! Did I get too carried away?

I could see Lorenzo sulking.

I should console him a bit.

If I tease him too much, he'll hold onto it for days.

"Lorenzo! We couldn't have created this opportunity without you! We're the best combo."

Surprisingly, this simple statement made Lorenzo's mouth twitch into a smile.

He's such a simple guy.

Hmm... If I think about how I automatically smile brightly at Monica's "I'll go wash up!", maybe my mom's saying "Men are simple like fools" is true.

Anyway.

Without Lautaro to stabilize Newcastle's defense, goals were coming too easily.

Aware of this, Newcastle's coach Isaac Enrique was trying to score on the counter despite being down 3-1 by pulling the line as far back as possible.

Of course, we could also easily win the match by safely dropping our line and just maintaining possession.

But our pride wouldn't allow that.

Our coach, who has a case of managerial arrogance, would never think of dropping the line in such a match.

-Arsenal continues to maintain a high line.

-They seem to be indicating that Newcastle's counterattacks aren't that threatening.

-At this moment, Newcastle's counterattack continues! A pass to Gaetan Nandez!

-Gaetan! Dribbling forward! Passes accurately to Kabil Fekir!

Newcastle's counterattack continues.

They seemed determined to score and ignite their pursuit.

But Ramsdale was an excellent goalkeeper.

He easily blocked Kabil Fekir's shot.

-Oh! Fantastic save by Ramsdale!

-Brilliant save by Marlon Ramsdale!

After that, the game was dull.

The first half continued with Arsenal's aggressive pressure and Newcastle's counterattack attempts.

"Spacing! Why is there a gap! You f*cking bastards!"

I remember Isaac Enrique's parade of English curses starting around the 30th minute of the first half.

Newcastle seemed to think they needed to stabilize their defense first to chase back.

Of course, we had no intention of letting them do that.

Jul Kaembe and I worked to spread the field as wide as possible to stretch Newcastle's defense.

It's fun to move centrally, but sometimes, creating plays from the flanks is another kind of fun in this position.

Thanks to this, Newcastle's defense naturally became more spaced out.

The full-backs couldn't leave Jul Kaembe and me alone, so these spaces opened up naturally.

Of course, it was Arsenal's full-backs and central midfielders who utilized these spaces.

Eventually, Newcastle took drastic measures by dropping their defensive midfielder, Demian Tetteh, deep down to form a five-back defense to block our attack.

And as the five-back defense formed, I delved into the space between the defense and the third line.

Yes, that means the half-space in front is empty.

And in this space, I was like a god.

Since my Parma days, more than half of my goals came from this position.

I received Jul Kaembe's short lob pass with my chest and took it straight to my left foot.

Once again, it was a volley shot.

-Minhoooooo!

-Gooooooal!

-Newcastle loses their will to chase! Minho's third goal in the 44th minute of the first half! Minho scores a hat-trick against Newcastle!

-All goals scored with volleys! Hahaha! Minho records a hat-trick with volley shots.

Newcastle must have a neurosis about volley shots.

All the goals they conceded to Arsenal were volley shots.

* * *

[Arsenal defeats Newcastle 5-2!]

[Minho leads the team to victory with 4 goals!]

[All 4 goals were volley shots! The return of Trezeguet? Arsenal fans go wild over Minho's fantastic goals!]

[Coach Isaac Enrique: "Minho was like a natural disaster. Facing him made me feel helpless."]

[Arsenal finishes all 5 goals with volley shots! Showcasing the pinnacle of beautiful football!]

[Perfect Pass & Move! Arsenal's beautiful football showcased again by coach Alain Levagne!]

[French coaches are truly different! Arsenal's love for French coaches!]

-Hahaha, this is insane.

-Our Donggu-hyung was also great at volleys...

-Wow... That was truly art soccer. They kept the ball in the air like seals and scored with volley shots.

-Park Minho is a god. Park Minho is a god. Park Minho is a god. Park Minho is a god. Park Minho is a god. Park Minho is a god. Park Minho is a god. Park Minho is a god.

-But why wasn't Park Minho picked as a wild card for this Olympics? If they picked him, a bronze medal would be guaranteed at least, right? What are they going to do about Park Minho's military service?

-Haha, military service for reserve soldier Park Minho?

-Hahaha, how can someone go to the military twice? Hahaha.

-???: Oh? I went to the military twice?

-Oppa Gangnam Style...

-Really, Arsenal is amazing; at this rate, an unbeaten season seems possible... Their recent performance is insane.

As soon as the match ended, stories about Arsenal scoring all five goals with volley shots spread through the media.

Moreover, the media's interest in me, having scored all four goals with volley shots, was even more intense.

According to rumors, the president of Real Madrid was so impressed by my volley hat-trick that he vowed to bring me in at any cost.

Of course, the person who enjoyed my performance against Newcastle the most was Monica, who was waiting at home.

Recently, she had been busy with photo shoots, so we hadn't seen each other often. After finishing the Newcastle away game and returning home, she had prepared dinner and was waiting for me.

"Minho! Welcome back!"

Hmm... Her outfit is quite provocative.

Somehow, I can't take my eyes off her.

It's inevitable as a man.

Sensing my gaze, Monica gave a sly smile and beckoned me over.

Kids, go away! Kids, go away!

From here on, it's adult time.

Ta-da!

The scene you wanted has been replaced with a poster featuring Lorenzo's dazzling smile.

* * *

Lorenzo thought.

Park Minho is definitely a different player.

He could clearly feel it in this match against Newcastle.

"Hmm... My partner is definitely different."

There were times when he found him annoying, but he was learning a lot while playing together.

So, he wanted to maintain his current form for a long time and keep playing with Park Minho.

To do that, Lorenzo thought he had to keep improving his weaknesses.

"Sure, my passing was a bit lacking, right?"

Lorenzo Lupo reflected on his shortcomings.

His most notable flaw was indeed his passing.

It's a common weakness among tall strikers over two meters, who tend to have weak ball control, but Lorenzo Lupo wasn't particularly weak with the ball at his feet.

However, his passing was somewhat lacking.

That didn't mean his passing was terrible.

It just felt lacking compared to other aspects of his game.

Lorenzo Lupo decided.

He would start improving it from now on.

So he pitched a tent near the training ground.

"Are you crazy?"

"Wow... Who lives at the training ground?"

"Lorenzo! How about booking a nearby hotel for a long stay? Are you sure this is okay?"

"What? A tent at the training ground?"

Despite his teammates' worried looks.

No one could stop Lorenzo.

His mind was firmly set.

Seeing this, Park Minho murmured.

"At this rate, he'll build a house next to the training ground and live there?"

Hearing this, Lorenzo shivered.

Then he grabbed Park Minho's hand and shouted.

"Eureka!"

The next day.

Park Minho heard the news about Lorenzo.

The house of "Groove Fruits," a wholesale fruit business behind Arsenal's training ground, had been sold, and Lorenzo was tearing it down to build a new house.

"Crazy guy."

Park Minho looked at Lorenzo with a dismayed expression and shook his head.
