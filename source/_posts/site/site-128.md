## 47. 4senal (2)

The worst situations often arise unexpectedly. In this context, the injury of the captain, Tyrone Tierney, created a significant hole in Arsenal's sturdy defense, and Manchester United, led by Ronaldo, was shaking that defense.

Arsenal was shaken by the unexpected situation.

At the same time, it became evident that Manchester United's attack was less efficient than expected.

Despite Arsenal's defense wavering like reeds in the wind, they hadn’t conceded a goal by the 20th minute of the first half.

At the same time, I had this thought:

"Ronaldo’s form is crap today."

I felt that marking Ronaldo wouldn’t be a significant issue.

The modified three-back system effectively marked Ronaldo and Andrew Rashford, suppressing Manchester United’s shots.

The problem was that our attack was also underperforming.

Specifically, while the inclusion of Bukayo Saka diversified our attacking routes, it also caused overlaps in movements between Saka and Amari Richards.

Manchester United’s sharp-witted defense exploited this, preventing us from scoring any meaningful goals.

If Tyrone Tierney had been there... We might have been leading 2-0 already.

As a result, even after more than half of the first half had passed, the score remained 0-0.

Both teams’ benches seemed to be preparing to go all out in the second half.

- Shin! He’s fast! The player leading Manchester United’s attack today is Shin!
- A sharp shoooot! Ramsdale’s save!
- Manchester United continues their attack centered on Shin!

He’s really playing tenaciously.

Junseo hyung genuinely seems to want the trophy.

That’s probably why he left Tottenham for Manchester United.

In today’s match, the standout player in Manchester United’s attack is definitely Junseo hyung.

Honestly, even Ronaldo pales in comparison to Junseo hyung today.

His obsession with winning is so intense it’s almost frightening.

"Minhooooooo!"

"Show them! Show those foolish Manchester United bastards the strength of Arsenal!"

As soon as I took possession of the ball, the Gooners roared.

It seemed that the incident in the 4th minute of the first half had triggered their frustration and anger towards Manchester United.

Of course, the Red Devils were not outdone by the Gooners.

Dressed in red uniforms, they raised their voices to cheer for their team.

The tense atmosphere continued.

Honestly, I didn’t want to lose this kind of match.

As the players became increasingly rough, negative feelings started to build up between them.

Particularly, the Manchester United players were under a lot of pressure.

Since the FA Cup was the only tournament they could realistically aim to win, they had no choice but to play tenaciously.

Naturally, the match became rougher.

By the end of the first half, players from both teams were rolling around on the field.

"It’s quite annoying."

It was very aggressive.

Arsenal was no different.

As soon as Tyrone Tierney was out, they also resorted to rough tackles to disrupt Manchester United’s attack.

"Our captain should start a fortune-telling business later."

"Right... The match is exactly as rough as Tyrone predicted."

Everything Tyrone Tierney said before he was carried off was coming true.

The only silver lining was that no more players were injured between the two teams.

"More than that, the frequency of cards being shown is too low."

Indeed, the referee was too lenient.

Also, there were some questionable calls.

But what can you do?

This too is part of football.

Looking at our coach’s expression, it seemed like he would substitute me at the slightest hint of injury.

After all, the league and the Europa League were more important than the FA Cup.

Well... That’s how the first half ended.

A first half filled with ridiculous shots and players rolling around the field.

Neither team was satisfied with the match.

Manchester United’s coach, Helge, seemed somewhat satisfied with the 0-0 score as he nodded and headed to the locker room.

Our coach, on the other hand, kept staring at me, asking, "Minho! You’re not hurt, right?" at least nine times.

In a way, the first half might be considered a win for Manchester United.

That’s what I think.

But the second half is the real issue.

I’m worried about how much more we’ll have to roll around the field in the second half.

I hope I don’t have to taste that bitter grass again.

But it doesn’t seem easy.

* * *

Thud!

"Oooooh!"

"You bastard! Do you want to die?"

"Get away from Minho!"

In the aerial battle, I got hit in the back of the head by an opponent’s elbow.

This time, the referee couldn’t let it slide and gave James McGuire a warning.

The Gooners hurled all sorts of insults and threw things as soon as I fell on the field.

Of course, when Ronaldo was brought down by Craig Martin’s rough tackle, the Red Devils threw things too.

No matter how much you try to stop hooligans from throwing things, they never change.

It’s bad manners as a football fan, whether you’re a Gooner or not, and it’s not a pleasant sight.

Ignoring my throbbing head, I passed the ball back to resume the match.

As soon as the second half started, Manchester United, led by an in-form Junseo hyung, attacked.

And Junseo hyung finally scored an amazing goal against us.

- Shiiiiin! A fantastic long-range shot goes in!
- He dribbled past one player and shot at a half-beat timing, resulting in a goal!
- Manchester United finally takes the lead! Arsenal sorely misses Tyrone due to his injury.
- Normally, Shin wouldn’t have had such a comfortable angle to shoot from that position. Arsenal must be regretting Tyrone’s absence.

Watching the Manchester United players run towards Junseo hyung, who was doing his click celebration, I encouraged our attackers.

"Let’s first equalize and then take it slow."

I could definitely feel that Manchester United had prepared a lot.

But if you ask whether I think we’ll lose this match...

I’d answer like this:

"Do you think we’ll lose with me here?"

The players grinned at my words.

Yeah, right now, we need this kind of confidence.

"Minho will score one, so let’s take it slow. We still have 30 minutes."

"Alright! One step at a time! One step!"

With Lorenzo leading the charge, the players started to focus and raise their spirits again.

"The referee is starting to pay attention to the physical play. Let’s exploit that."

I nodded quietly at Lorenzo’s words.

No matter how lenient the referee is, he would start to notice if the game gets this rough.

Just as our opponents gained opportunities through fouls, we too could get opportunities through their fouls.

Moreover, I noticed that James McGuire’s movements were much slower than usual.

If we exploited this, we could aim for an easy goal.

I didn’t know why they kept using that slowpoke, but I understood that James McGuire was the reason Manchester United’s defense had some semblance of order.

James McGuire was both Manchester United’s weak point and a player they couldn’t do without to maintain their defensive line.

Now, the match resumed.

Having scored, Manchester United dropped their line deep.

Their mindset was to protect their lead.

But it seemed they forgot the downside of dropping their line.

So they need to be taught a proper lesson.

If you drop your line thoughtlessly to protect a one-goal lead, you’re bound to get beaten up.

* * *

It’s a crisis.

It’s definitely a crisis for Arsenal.

From the beginning of the first half, with the captain Tyrone Tierney being injured, to conceding the first goal to Manchester United, it was a very bad situation.

But the Gooners were not worried.

No, they were more concerned about one player’s health.

To be precise, as long as Park Minho wasn’t injured, they didn’t care.

"Thank goodness Minho isn’t hurt."

"Those damn Manchester United bastards... How rough are they?"

For the Gooners, Ronaldo rolling three times on the field from Craig Martin’s tackle was a fair tackle, while Park Minho slightly slipping from Luke Shaw’s fair physical play was akin to murder.

That’s how the Gooners saw it.

Ignoring the Gooners' concerns, Park Minho possessed the ball and cut through Manchester United’s deep defensive line.

The Gooners wanted to tell Arsenal to give up the FA Cup and focus on the league or the Europa League, as an injury to a key player at a crucial time would be devastating.

But they could only watch in awe as Park Minho possessed the ball and pushed through the opponent’s defense with dazzling skills and a solid physique.

It was clear why Parma fans called Park Minho a "fantasista."

"He’s amazing."

"I’m going crazy. The fact that such a player belongs to Arsenal makes me excited."

"You’re crazy."

Despite Manchester United’s deep defensive line, they struggled to stop Park Minho’s movements.

Moreover, Park Minho wasn’t a lone wolf.

He effectively utilized Arsenal’s excellent attackers.

Manchester United started to waver.

Feeling pressured, they committed fouls.

In just 10 minutes, they received three more cards and started to be pushed back.

Seeing that most of his defenders had received cards, Manchester United’s coach Helge wiped his face with a bitter expression.

"He’s a terrifying attacker."

Of course, Manchester United’s attackers were top-notch too.

Including Shin Junseo from the same country as Park Minho, they had Ronaldo, Andrew, Arsen, Jadon Sancho, etc.

A squad filled with players who could be starters in any team—that’s Manchester United.

Despite leading by one goal, Manchester United sat back to protect their lead because of that attacker.

Holding onto the ball tenaciously, creating space,

And as soon as his teammates charged into that space, he delivered sharp passes, breaking through Manchester United’s solid defense.

And the subsequent shot was perfect.

Although it didn’t go in,

The fact that it led to a goal made coach Helge feel bitter.

- Goooooooooooal! Amari Richards’ goooooal!
- Minho’s shot was brilliantly punched out by Danny Henderson! And Amari Richards followed it up perfectly!
- The second ball landed in a perfect spot.
- With this, Arsenal brings the match back to square one! Indeed, this season’s Arsenal is different!

Arsenal, who seemed to be on the verge of crumbling, regained their composure in the second half and pressured Manchester United.

Coach Helge wiped his dry lips with a bitter expression.

"Whew..."

He wished someone would do something.

But the player who should do that was showing a disappointing performance today.

"Is this the end of Ronaldo?"

He looked exhausted.

Considering the possibility of extra time, coach Helge decided to make a substitution.

Just as he was about to call Jadon Sancho, who was warming up,

He saw the referee blowing his whistle, showing a red card to Ronaldo, and Park Minho rolling on the field like Neymar.

"What the..."

A curse naturally escaped coach Helge’s mouth.

* * *

Didn’t I say it?

Ronaldo’s childish competitiveness would definitely lead to regret in crucial matches.

I didn’t know it would be today, though.

This time, Ronaldo slightly used his elbow again, but the referee couldn’t let it slide.

My ‘field rolling techniques’ learned from watching ‘Neymar highlights’ worked perfectly.

Which highlights, you ask? That’s a secret.

That childish guy was naturally frustrated, and the referee firmly showed a yellow card, followed by a red card, expelling Ronaldo.

No matter how lenient the referee is, two elbow incidents were crossing the line.

Thanks to that, I secured a free-kick from a good position, and with Ronaldo’s expulsion, it became a favorable situation where we just had to defend against a Manchester United with one less player.

"Damn... Minho! You’re not hurt, right?"

"That damn bastard!"

"Hey! Let go! Let go of me!"

Well... While I was rolling on the field, the players from both teams spent quite some time arguing, allowing me to enjoy the field like a bed and rest.

Now, it’s time to get back to work.

I got up for the free-kick, rinsed my mouth with water, and approached the ball.

Manchester United, having conceded a free-kick from a relatively close distance, hurriedly made substitutions to focus on defense.

Their clear intention was to hold on to the 1-1 score and push for a penalty shootout.

Of course, their hopes would be shattered.

Thwack!

- Minooooooooooo!
- A fantastic free-kick! Minho scores a brilliant goal, and Arsenal turns the game around to lead 2-1!
- Ah! Until the middle of the second half, it seemed like Manchester United’s game... But indeed, this season’s Arsenal is different! They maintain their strength until the end of the second half!

As soon as the goal went in, the Gooners at Wembley Stadium screamed and chanted my name.

Some called me a god, some a king, and some a monster.

It didn’t matter what they called me.

I was happy as long as they chanted my name.

This must be why I play football.

"Ahhhh! Trust me! I’m here!"

As I shouted, the Gooners excitedly chanted my name even louder.

* * *

[The meaning of ‘4senal’ has changed! Arsenal defeats Manchester United 2-1 to advance to the FA Cup final! Their opponent is Bournemouth!]

[The changed meaning of ‘4senal’! They are running for victories in the League Cup, FA Cup, Premier League, and Europa League!]

[Coach Helge: ‘It was the worst. You know who I’m talking about.’]

[Ronaldo! He posted a complaint about the coach on social media after the match but deleted it within an hour!]

[Coach Alain Levagne: ‘I heard Arsenal has an unfortunate meme called ‘4/16.’ We will break that and become champions this season.’]

[Arsenal aiming for a quadruple? Gooners in London are fainting due to Arsenal’s sensational performance!]

[Arsenal overcoming the curse of ‘4’! Even if everyone doesn’t want them to win, they have overcome it.]

[Minho: ‘We are Arsenal. Even if we have bad memories in April, we are not afraid of superstitions. We are warriors.’]

"Ah... It’s a bit cringy."

Even though it was my interview, it felt a bit embarrassing.

Seeing the group chat filled with screenshots of my interview teasing me, my face turned red.

Well... Monica liked it, so

I don’t regret it.

Anyway,

To overcome the bad superstition deeply embedded in Arsenal’s minds called the ‘April curse,’ we need to unite as one.

And we can definitely overcome it. Even if the world wants us to lose, I absolutely don’t want to lose.

Curses are just superstitions.

When we unite as one, we can definitely overcome superstitions.

That’s what I think.
