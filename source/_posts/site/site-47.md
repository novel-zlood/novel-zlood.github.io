## 18. Coppa Italia and an Unbeaten Season (1)

- It was a good game.

- Due to your performance in the match against Germany, many clubs are now more interested in Minho.

- Depending on the situation, renewing the contract with Parma might turn out much more favorable for us.

After returning to Italy,

Leo seemed to be very pleased, sending me messages about my performance in the match against Germany.

- Especially, the moment you scored a hat-trick gave me chills down my spine. Amazing.

You didn’t have to put me on a plane for this.

He seems to be more ecstatic after watching this game.

While it feels a bit burdensome, it also means I am doing well, so I feel good about it.

Though it might sound like self-praise,

The reason Leo treats me so well is probably because of my records so far.

My performance in Parma and the national team has been extraordinary.

- Minho, we hired a physical trainer and an instructor to train you during the off-season.

- They are really amazing, so look forward to it.

- They will be of great help to you after the season ends.

Who could it be that he is making such a fuss?

I am strangely curious.

But I am looking forward to it.

I still feel I lack experience, so if they are as amazing as Leo says, I could learn a lot.

I wish the season would end soon.

Time passed after rejoining the team.

As we entered April, the other teams started to mark me more closely.

As a result, I couldn’t show good performance in the matches against Frosinone on April 2 and Cosenza on April 9.

Thanks to that, in Korea, people quickly started saying, ‘Yeah, Park Minho is a fluke.’

Well, I scored two goals in the next match against Monza, and those words disappeared again.

Kenez and Banjiri kept saying I changed a lot after returning from the A match.

I don’t really notice the difference.

These guys often said during training or on the field that my passes became much easier to receive.

Frankly, Santiago’s compliments seemed a bit different.

It felt like he was trying to butter me up to get his SNS account back.

But when the coach and the head coach also praised my passes, I quickly realized it wasn’t just flattery.

Sorry, Banjiri.

I misunderstood you a bit.

But I am not giving back the SNS account.

Anyway, after returning from the A match, Parma, with 2 wins and 1 draw, started to receive close attention.

There are four matches left for the unbeaten championship.

They wouldn’t want to be remembered as the victims in Serie B history, so they will come at us more fiercely.

The match against Ternana on April 17 was like that as well.

It was a home game, and when they caught up to a 2-2 tie in the first half, I was startled.

But in the second half, Kenez and I each scored a goal, securing a 4-2 victory.

- I thought we were going to lose.

- Minho! You’re the best!

- It feels like the team revolves around you, Minho.

- Is the Coppa Italia win possible?

- Since we won the first leg, the possibility is quite high. The problem is whether AC Milan or Lazio will advance.

The fans were already talking more about the Coppa Italia semifinal second leg and the final than the unbeaten championship.

Honestly, the current performance was enough to satisfy Parma fans.

New players also adapted well this season.

It was a season where the 18-year-old Kenez successfully debuted, we secured promotion with the league championship, and had notable performances in the Coppa Italia.

They couldn’t help but be happy.

The fans seemed to want to see us achieve both: the unbeaten championship in Serie B and winning the Coppa Italia.

Among them, we started preparing for the Coppa Italia semifinal second leg, which was right around the corner.

It was a home game.

In the first leg, Parma had won 2-1 against Atalanta away.

Even if we lost 1-0 at home, we would advance to the final, so coach Alain Lavagne prepared an offensive strategy.

“Just defending will eventually lead to a breakthrough.”

Giovanni shared the same opinion as the coach.

Indeed, many teams in continental cup competitions like the Champions League or Europa League went defensive in the second leg and ended up being overturned.

There was no reason we couldn’t end up the same.

Moreover, offensive football suited Parma’s style more.

That’s how we had been playing so far.

Thanks to that, we were on the verge of an unbeaten championship.

Most fans wanted to see an exciting match, even if we lost spectacularly.

Thanks to that, we felt a surge in momentum.

On the other hand, Atalanta’s atmosphere wasn’t so great.

Though they secured 4th place in the league,

Their recent performances weren’t good.

They were closely trailed by Mourinho's AS Roma by just 3 points.

- Damn team! When will our defense stabilize?

- Let’s make some big signings too! I know we have a strong team, but… I want to see us win!

- At least win the Coppa Italia! The opponent is Parma from Serie B, right?

- Do you underestimate Parma?

- Honestly, without Minho, Parma is a crappy team.

- And which team lost 2-1 in the first leg without Minho?

Thanks to that, Atalanta fans seemed desperate to win the Coppa Italia.

While qualifying for the Champions League is good,

They felt it was time to have a trophy.

That’s what they seemed to think.

But I also want to have a trophy.

Can’t you let me have it?

* * *

Atalanta prepared to field all their regular starters who couldn’t play in the first leg due to injuries.

Moreover, they spent more time analyzing Park Minho than usual.

It was possible because it was the end of the season.

In the long league with many opponents, it’s rare to scrutinize one attacker so closely.

That meant Atalanta was desperate to win.

“No one doubts Minho’s speed. I think that’s the scariest part.”

“I agree. Minho’s speed is underrated. Many coaches in Serie B have forgotten about his speed and suffered greatly.”

At coach Gasperini’s words, the assistant coach nodded quietly in agreement.

They gathered the defenders and meticulously went through Park Minho’s individual skills and patterns.

Surprisingly, no clear weaknesses were found.

“That guy is a monster. No weak foot either.”

“Recently, he seems to have reduced the frequency of crossing with the outside of his foot.”

“Since switching to a 3-4-3 formation, his dribbling attempts per game increased by 1.3 times.”

“His weaknesses are… physical duels and aerial ability?”

“That’s just relatively weaker compared to his other abilities, not a true weakness.”

“Ugh… This is driving me crazy.”

Nonetheless, they did everything they could.

They spent quite a bit of time studying Park Minho, who turned out to be a monstrous player.

“This guy was a regular person until he was 24?”

Hearing one of the coaches, Atalanta’s defenders frowned and sighed.

Realizing that the second leg wouldn’t be easy either.

* * *

Coppa Italia Semifinal Second Leg.

The team that wins this match advances to the Coppa Italia final, so both home fans and away fans were more enthusiastic than ever.

“Win today!”

“Minhooooooo!”

“Lead us to the final!”

“Let’s go to Stadio Olimpico!”

With the first leg ending 2-1, Atalanta still had a chance to overturn the score, and Parma could win if they just defended well.

Naturally, fans were highly enthusiastic.

Hope was glimmering right before their eyes.

The fan rivalry that started outside the stadium continued inside.

Atalanta fans mocking Parma’s bankruptcy and Parma fans calling them fake Nerazzurri.

Sorry for trolling.

Is the Parma vs. Atalanta match for real?

My heart swells with pride.

Of course, I’m joking.

Anyway,

The noise from the fan rivalry reached the locker room.

The heartbeats of the players standing in the narrow hallway waiting to enter the field were pounding.

“You’re Minho, right?”

“Yeah.”

“Nice to meet you.”

“Nice to meet you too.”

The player who greeted me with a smile was Halit Demiral, whom they recently brought on loan from Juventus.

Seeing famous players directly has become common now, so I’ve gotten used to it.

After a brief greeting, I looked ahead.

Except for Halit, Atalanta’s defenders were glaring at me, determined to avenge the first leg.

I subtly avoided their gaze, but they kept staring, so I hid behind Kenez.

With them glaring so fiercely, I felt I should use Kenez to hide today.

* * *

Both Parma and Atalanta brought out three-back formations.

Unlike Parma, which had no significant changes from the first leg, Atalanta had changed quite a bit.

- Atalanta has prepared a 3-4-2-1 formation.

- It’s slightly different in detail from the 3-4-1-2 they used in the first leg.

- Halit Demiral and Vigor Mehle, who were out due to injuries, are starting today.

Although their tactics changed slightly in detail,

The main framework remained the same.

Strong pressing and 1-on-1 man-to-man defense.

These two tactics didn’t change.

This is Atalanta’s football.

With this style, Atalanta has achieved decent results in Serie A without superstars.

So they can’t give it up.

Coach Gasperini didn’t abandon his philosophy.

Atalanta wavered early on as Parma exploited this, but Gasperini quietly watched.

He was convinced.

Even if they waver, they won’t collapse.

That’s the team he built, Atalanta.

He trusted and waited.

That trust was proven in the 27th minute of the first half when Anthony Piccini scored the opening goal.

- An-tho-nyyyyy! Piccini!

- He scores! One more goal and they will overturn the score! Overturn!

- The score is 2-2, but if the match ends like this, Parma wins on away goals.

They just need one more goal.

Coach Gasperini clenched his fist.

“Move! Remember what we prepared!”

“Block! Block!”

Atalanta’s players rushed to stop Park Minho from breaking through.

Passing the ball again, Park Minho.

Watching that, Gasperini felt even more exhilarated.

‘Yes, this is football. This is a team sport.’

It’s a sport of scoring and blocking goals.

Football is played by 11 players.

Showing excellent teamwork, Atalanta started to move more organically, and Parma struggled more than expected.

Moreover, their prepared attacks targeted Parma’s goal post more fiercely.

- Parma! They are in danger!

- They keep wavering! If this continues, they might concede another goal!

Parma seemed to be on the verge of collapsing.

Watching this, Coach Gasperini briefly thought of the word ‘victory.’

But,

Coach Gasperini forgot one thing.

Football is played by 11 players.

On the other hand, it’s also a sport where one crack can change the game.

“Minho!”

“Park Mi-noooooo!”

“Ahhhh! Go!”

The moment Park Minho grabbed the ball,

Coach Gasperini felt a chilling sensation.

He quickly shouted.

“Stop him! Foul him if you have to!”

But it wasn’t easy.

Ruslan Malinovskyi stretched out his leg to stop Park Minho’s charge,

But Park Minho, who had already started accelerating, lightly dodged Ruslan’s leg and broke through to the flank.

- Minho! Park Minho!

- He’s fast! Really fast!

Wingback Vigor Mehle quickly blocked Park Minho’s path, trying to push him further to the flank.

But Park Minho got past Vigor Mehle, who was on Atalanta’s right flank, with just two quick dribbles.

Waaahhhhhhhhhh!

The home fans’ cheers grew louder.

At the same time, seeing Park Minho breaking into the half-space, goalkeeper Juan Colosso shouted in a panic.

“Don’t give him any angles!”

Hearing that, Gerard Dinsic and Halit Demiral quickly rushed to block Park Minho’s path.

They paid particular attention to his right foot.

They knew from analysis that allowing a right-footed curler from this position would be dangerous.

But,

Contrary to their expectations, Park Minho chose his left foot.

A short inside pass to the center.

The player at the end of the pass was Kenez Marsetico, who muscled past Atalanta’s last central defender, Rafael Carvalho, and broke into the danger zone.

Baaang!

The sound of the leather being struck hard was heard.

At the same time, the sound of the net shaking.

Thwack!

Seeing the ball go in,

Kenez ran like a beast toward the camera and roared like a tiger.

Seeing that, Atalanta’s coach Gasperini looked despondent.

On the other hand, Parma’s coach Alain Lavagne smiled brightly, as if intoxicated with joy.

“Minho is a god.”

With Park Minho’s consistent performance in today’s match,

Coach Alain now saw Park Minho as nothing less than a football god.
