## 30. Mini Treble!(5)

You always have to be cautious because you never know when unexpected events will occur in a match called the 'final'.

-Romaaaaaa!

-Jordan Veretout has scored!

-The score is tied again at 2-2!

Even when I score a fantastic goal,

I can't prevent mistakes in defense.

No, this time, the opponent did well.

Jordan Veretout moved with determination.

Our defender made a mistake while trying to clear the ball.

Jordan didn’t miss that mistake.

He charged in fearlessly and scored a goal.

-That's the end of the first half!

-Overall, Parma is leading the flow of the game, and Roma seems to be capitalizing on Parma's occasional mistakes.

The first half ended.

The score was 2-2, more intense than expected.

But we didn't feel like we were going to lose.

I was confident we could recover the score during the remaining time, and since our defense didn’t show signs of major shaking despite the mistake, I was assured.

Halftime.

The players who entered the locker room didn't seem overly concerned about allowing two goals.

Of course, there was feedback on the goals we conceded.

Especially, our mischievous player was called by the assistant coach and was getting a good scolding.

Our performance in the first half wasn't bad.

But it wasn't that great either.

The coach, who implanted that fact into the players, looked at me and quietly made a request.

“Minho... Can you score just one more goal?”

“I'll definitely score at least one more than the opponent.”

Seeing the coach’s bright smile in response to my answer made me feel good.

But...

Was our coach's hair always that thick?

I heard he got a hair transplant. Did it actually work?

I don’t know.

Let’s just focus on the game.

* * *

The second half came after the first half ended.

The winner of the Europa League will be decided in the remaining 45 minutes.

Roma seemed to have boosted their momentum by tying the score at the end of the first half.

Unlike the first half, they started pressing us aggressively from the beginning of the second half.

-Roma is pressing Parma aggressively from the start of the second half, unlike the first half!

However, unlike the first half, our defense was handling Roma's attacks well in the second half.

Especially, Roma’s main striker, Tammy Abraham, aside from the PK he scored early in the first half, hadn’t shown much good performance so far.

“Get lost!”

Tammy Abraham, pushing Klajdi Tursha with his hand and sprinting forward, got the ball.

But the assistant referee raised the flag.

-Tammy Abraham! This is already his third offside in today's match!

“What do you mean offside?”

An enraged Tammy Abraham glared at the assistant referee and protested briefly, but he had to shut his mouth when his teammate Jordan Veretout smacked him on the back of his head and took him away.

Roma's offensive line was running much more than in the first half, but they couldn’t easily seize opportunities.

Naturally, the momentum began to shift.

Roma, trying to settle the score early in the second half, started to drop back a bit as their offensive didn’t work.

Yes, they began to look towards extra time.

Roma made the first move.

The substitution happened earlier than expected.

Tammy Abraham and Henrikh Mkhitaryan were taken off, and Stephan El Shaarawy and Bernard were brought in.

-Roma is changing their formation. It seems they are dropping their line to the level of almost 5-4-1 instead of 4-1-4-1.

It didn’t matter to me.

No, it was even better.

The defensive midfielder pressing me aggressively dropped deeper, giving me more freedom.

Thanks to that, Parma could push up the pace from the 20th minute of the second half.

-The ball is connected to Minho!

-Today, Minho is linking passes well all over the field like Parma's heartbeat!

-Kenneth! Header straight on!

-Pau Lopez! A fantastic save! He saves Roma from a crisis!

Now Roma firmly parked the bus.

We began to shake the opponent's defense using excellent targets Kenneth and Filippo.

Well, the result hadn't come out yet.

The defense was more solid than expected.

I could feel that Roma had prepared a lot.

It seemed like they were really planning to go to extra time.

Maybe they even prepared for a penalty shootout.

It was literally a battle between a spear and a shield.

Roma blocked our attacks with physical defense.

It could be described as desperate.

-Roma! Amazing! Incredible save!

-Coach Andre Villas-Boas is encouraging the players! He looks quite composed, unlike the first half!

As time slowly passed, the end was in sight.

Parma was also showing a bit of impatience.

No matter how great the team and the young passionate players were, you never know what could happen if it goes to extra time.

Even though I was thinking about those parts and running more to focus on connections, I kept feeling how well prepared Roma's ten-man defense was.

I could hear Roma fans chanting, raising their spirits more and more.

In such a situation, Roma’s counterattack was fierce.

It was enough to make Parma falter for a moment.

-Great save by goalkeeper Jose Juan!

-A counterattack from Roma in the 37th minute of the second half! Parma’s heart must have skipped a beat!

-Roma is gradually dragging the game into their pace! If this continues, who knows what will happen in extra time!

It was a bit dangerous.

Looking at our coach, he was preparing a substitution.

He took out the tireless runner Perelle from the center and brought in the captain, Marjan Kurtić, on the field.

Marjan shouted to everyone as soon as he came in.

“Fabian, move to the side! It's a 4-3-3! Minho, move up to the left!”

Well, it’s not just the opponent who prepared various tactics.

We also had a hidden card.

The back-four tactic we used for the first time this season.

Parma threw everything for the win.

* * *

Coach Andre Villas-Boas was confident.

He was confident that his decision to drag the game into extra time was correct.

Right from the start of the second half, Roma tried all possible attacks and then immediately dropped back.

And they dragged the time.

They hid inside their shell like a turtle.

Some might call it cowardly.

Or they might mock him saying he’s becoming more like Coach Mourinho with whom his relationship soured.

But.

He wanted victory.

He wanted to win.

He could throw philosophy into the trash for the team’s victory and championship.

He was the man who watched Coach Mourinho’s football more closely than anyone else.

Until the time passed 30 minutes into the second half.

His decision seemed to be precise.

No, it was precise.

Parma had 33 shots, and Roma had 9 shots.

But the score was tied at 2-2.

The ten-man defense he employed worked perfectly.

The problem was… that damn number 24.

‘Minho...!’

That magician could do something.

If he could just block that part well, there was a chance.

But seeing Park Minho focusing on connections, Coach Andre Villas-Boas gradually gained confidence.

Yeah, no matter how great a player is,

They can be helpless before a perfected tactic.

He clenched his fist.

‘We can win!’

If necessary, they could go to a penalty shootout.

And in the end, become the winners.

The results from the league and Coppa Italia would be forgotten.

That’s the power of the Europa League.

It’s the prestige of a tournament that grants a ticket to the Champions League.

“Coach!”

At the sudden shout from the assistant coach, he snapped out of his thoughts and looked at the field.

The players were being substituted.

Santiago was heading to the center.

Park Minho was moving to the left wing.

And the defensive line was a back-four.

“A 4-3-3 formation?”

Yes, it wasn’t only Roma and Coach Andre who prepared for the Europa League final.

Parma also prepared.

A hidden card called the back-four.

“But it’s too late!”

The remaining time was only about 5 minutes.

Even with added time, Parma would have about 8 minutes.

But it was strange.

Why did he feel uneasy whenever the ball headed to Park Minho?

Clearly, time was on Roma’s side.

Why did the remaining time seem so long?

“Tighten up more!”

“Stay calm! Stay calm!”

Coach Andre Villas-Boas comforted his players and calmed his own feelings until the end.

Yeah, time is short.

There’s not enough time for that monster to cast his magic.

Roma can win if they hold on.

Just when he was sure of that, the monster moved.

-Minho! He’s dribbling up! Armando Pellegrini is hurriedly following him!

-Oh! Fantastic dribble! Minho easily evades Armando! The flank is open!

-Niki Calzdorf is rushing over!

-Minho! Whoaaaa! Marseille turn! Suddenly, space opens up! Roma! Roma! They are in danger!

A scene where Park Minho single-handedly broke through Roma’s right flank appeared.

Coach Andre swallowed hard and prayed.

Hoping that Park Minho’s breakthrough would end there.

But.

The worst always comes at the end.

That monster was given a chance.

Piiiii!

-A free-kick is awarded in a dangerous position!

-A free-kick in a position close enough to aim directly! Roma! A crisis in the 43rd minute of the second half!

A chance created solely by Park Minho.

Coach Andre Villas-Boas quietly prayed.

Prayed that the monster would make a mistake.

And Park Minho standing in front of the ball.

He looked at the goalpost with cold eyes.

* * *

It’s a good opportunity.

A free-kick chance obtained right before the second half ends.

If we miss this chance, it’s definitely going to extra time.

The distance is mid-20 meters?

A position slightly off-center to the side.

If I curl it, it’s perfect to aim for the top of the goalpost.

Usually, in such situations, the heart races a lot, or the field of vision narrows...

Strangely, I felt no different from usual.

Everyone’s eyes were on me.

Fans were shouting my name.

I took a deep breath and stepped back.

Then the referee blew the whistle.

Piiiii!

I took the free-kick to the course I planned from the start.

The ball I kicked strongly curved beautifully and was sucked into the top of the goalpost, and Roma’s goalkeeper Pau Lopez dived, but even though his fingertips touched the ball, it didn’t change its trajectory.

Thud!

I heard the sound of the net shaking.

This moment seemed to move slowly, and suddenly, a huge cheer hit my ears.

Waaaaaaaah!

At the same time, Parma’s players rushed towards me.

Only then did I realize.

Oh, I was more nervous than usual.

And even in such a situation, I managed to score a goal.

A free-kick goal in the 44th minute of the second half.

Parma's victory was almost certain.

I realized that fact with this goal.

* * *

-The match ends!

-Parma! Parma! The Parma that collapsed with bankruptcy! They have returned to Serie A and made history with a mini treble!

-Amazing! Amazing! Parma has become the perfect fairy-tale hero!

Roma's players sat down on the field.

Parma's players celebrated their victory.

Coach Alain clenched his fist and admired the victory.

Coach Andre Villas-Boas looked at the field with a despondent expression.

Then the awards ceremony was prepared.

AS Roma’s team received the runners-up medals first.

Then, Parma's players received their winner’s medals and went up to the podium one by one.

Park Minho received the Golden Boot and the MVP award.

And then.

The trophy given to the captain, Marjan Kurtić.

When he lowered the trophy and then raised it high.

Confetti popped, celebrating their victory.

The 22-23 season Europa League champions were Parma.

And they wrote the perfect fairy tale and made history in the football world.

[Parma! The protagonist of the mini treble!]

[Parma writes history! They were the heroes of the fairy tale!]

[Parma's fairy tale ends!]

[The Europa League champions are Parma!]

[Parma also wins the last match of the league!]

[Parma triumphs over Lazio with a 5-1 victory!]

[Park Minho sets the record for most goals in Serie A! Writing new history with 39 league goals in one season!]

[Park Minho wins Serie A Player of the Year!]

The media quickly reported Parma’s Europa League victory and mini treble achievement.

Park Minho set incredible records this 22-23 season.

He recorded 62 goals and 44 assists in 51 games this season.

He not only set the record for most goals in Serie A but also swept the most assists in the league.

At the same time, big clubs' interest in Parma's main players began to pour in.

[Interest pouring in for Park Minho! Parma is practically thinking of selling him!]

Yeah, just like how the fairy tale of Leicester City ended,

The moment the fairy tale ended, reality arrived.

And it came very quickly.
