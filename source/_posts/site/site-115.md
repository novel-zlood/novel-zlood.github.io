## 43. Title Contender (2)

It's been a while since I had a free kick.

The distance was quite close.

Today's game seems to end with a one-point difference.

It was just a simple hunch.

At the same time, my 'instinct' was telling me that this free kick was really important.

So I couldn't miss this opportunity.

The opposing team's goalkeeper from Liverpool was positioning the defensive wall.

It seemed like they were wary of me aiming directly at the goal.

-Mino steps up to the ball.

-Mino has a very high success rate with free kicks. He has succeeded from similar positions many times before!

With the referee's whistle, I ran towards the ball.

The ball, perfectly struck with my left foot, curved and flew towards the goal, and Alisson Becker, the goalkeeper, leaped high to match my shot.

-Alissoooon! He deflects it!

-But the second ball! Bruno Campos shoots! Goooaaaal!

-Arsenal takes the lead against Liverpool, 1-0!

Although my free kick was blocked,

Liverpool couldn't stop Bruno's shot, who broke through the defenders, and conceded a goal.

Bruno, who scored, ran towards me and shouted.

"Minoooo! You aimed for this, didn't you?"

"Huh...? Yeah, I aimed for it."

"As expected! Mino is a god! A god!"

Well, with those expectant eyes looking at me and asking... how could I say no?

That's why it's important to build trust with your teammates. No one doubted me and looked at me with eyes saying, "Wow! As expected of Mino!"

Lorenzo, on the other hand, seemed to think, 'What is this?' as he looked at me and the players.

Well... If you're upset, why don't you score more than 30 goals each season and see if they'll make a fuss over you like this?

"Mino... That expression just now looked really annoying."

Lorenzo, who read my expression, frowned.

Geez... He's pretty quick-witted.

Anyway.

After the goal, the remaining time in the first half flowed, and it ended just like that.

For Liverpool, who effectively blocked Arsenal's attacks throughout the first half, it would be a disappointing result.

At the same time, Arsenal's defense sighed in relief.

It was evident on their faces that they were physically and mentally exhausted from blocking Liverpool's attack, especially with Dusan Vlahovic joining them.

As soon as we entered the locker room, the defenders sat down with exhausted expressions.

Of course, just like us, Liverpool also ran a lot in the first half, so they would have their own issues.

Hmm... The only concern in the first half was that Martin Ødegaard, the core of Arsenal's play, couldn't easily bring the ball up due to pressure from the opposing midfielders.

As a result, Liverpool had 67% possession, making the flow of the game favorable for them.

Although we were leading 1-0 on the scoreboard, anything could happen in the second half.

"They're really giving us a hard time. Those X*ing guys."

How severe could it be for Ødegaard to swear and get angry?

I thought Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp had prepared well tactically.

Our coach seemed to have a lot on his mind too, but since we were ahead, there probably wouldn't be any major changes in the second half.

And so, the second half began after halftime.

Liverpool made early substitutions in midfield and defense, focusing more on their build-up play from the back.

There were no issues in their attack development.

It seemed that Jurgen Klopp thought the instability in their build-up play from the back led to the crisis.

Well... he was right.

Now the possession ratio had widened to about 8:2.

There were hardly any situations where the ball was properly connected to Lorenzo and me up front.

In such a situation, Liverpool finally showed the power of their tactical changes and substitutions in the 15th minute of the second half.

Dusan Vlahovic, who got a perfect chance.

He scored for Liverpool.

-Goooaaaal!

-Liverpool equalizes 1-1! The scorer is Dusan Vlahovic, who transferred from Atletico Madrid!

-Here comes the goal! Amazing!

Woooooooah!

As soon as Vlahovic scored, Anfield was filled with the cheers of the Kop.

If Arsenal has me, Liverpool has Vlahovic, who was showing his presence.

"It's okay! Let's focus! Focus!"

"Stay calm, just a bit more!"

Despite conceding a goal, the players regained their composure.

From a distance, I could see a young Gooner in the away section shouting my name as loud as he could.

Minoooo!

Well... It's a tough match.

But it's not an impossible game to win.

Yeah, I should score another dramatic goal to be called a 'god,' shouldn't I?

"Ugh! That expression just now was really annoying."

Lorenzo is a heretic.

Someone shut this guy up.

* * *

After equalizing 1-1, Liverpool pressed even harder, pushing Arsenal back.

Of course, Arsenal didn't just take it lying down.

By urgently adding a new player to the center, they directly confronted Liverpool to dominate the midfield.

Thanks to that, the midfield battle between the two teams from around the 20th minute of the second half was fierce.

-A card is shown.

-Liverpool's Rupert Jones commits a foul. The referee immediately shows a yellow card, right?

-There's some bleeding from Tim White's nose. He got hit by an elbow during the contest.

In the tight space, the battle between the two teams was inevitable.

With Liverpool's strong pressure, Martin Ødegaard made a mistake and lost the ball.

"Ødegaard!"

"Damn! Just wait!"

With Bukayo Saka, who came on for Tyler Smith Rowe, shouting, Ødegaard irritably regained the ball he lost.

-It's even more intense than the first half! It seems neither team is satisfied with just one point!

-The ball is passed from the center to the side!

-Bukayo Saka is driving the ball up.

Bukayo Saka, slowly driving the ball up.

He began looking around, searching for an appropriate space to pass the ball.

And then he connected the ball to Park Minho, who was moving centrally, and then made a run behind the defender.

Following Bukayo Saka was Tune Sole.

-Tune Sole urgently marks Bukayo Saka, creating space for Mino to cut through!

-Kyle Van Dijk steps up to block him! Rupert Jones is charging from behind!

Seizing the opportunity, Park Minho cut through the center, but was quickly isolated by the cooperative defense of Kyle Van Dijk and Rupert Jones.

Park Minho, who was slowly driving the ball in.

He gave up on breaking through and passed the ball to Bruno Campos, who had moved to the opposite side, continuing the attack.

-Oh... Arsenal is resorting to their U-shaped build-up when things aren't going well.

-Mino is doing well in the center, but without help, he tends to get isolated like this sometimes... Though Mino’s overwhelming breakthrough ability has covered this issue until now.

-Yes, but the opponent is Liverpool. No matter how good Mino is, it can be tough to create something alone.

Time continued to pass.

With about 5 minutes left in the second half.

Even Liverpool, who had recorded overwhelming possession, started showing signs of fatigue towards the end of the second half.

The possession ratio had dropped to 50-50.

The Kop filling Anfield thought the game would end with a 1-point draw.

But with about 3 minutes left in regular time in the second half, coach Alain Lavagne made a decisive move.

-Tyrone Tierney is out, and Jules Kambé steps onto the field!

-Oh! This means they're shifting from a back four to a back three. Kamiya, Craig Martin, and Ricardo form the back three.

The formation changed to 3-5-2.

Park Minho started moving as a second striker.

Centering around Jules Kambé, Arsenal began shaking Liverpool's flanks.

With Arsenal, who had been quietly defending and waiting for a counterattack, suddenly playing their card in the last moments, coach Jurgen Klopp looked troubled, stroking his chin.

And Park Minho, who started moving centrally from the second line, quietly watched Liverpool's defender Michael Robertson, whose reactions were slowly becoming sluggish.

* * *

Michael Robertson is a good player.

I can say this for sure.

If he wasn't, Liverpool wouldn't have spent a large sum of money to sign him.

Otherwise, they wouldn't have brought him in the first place.

But even such talented players are helpless in front of overwhelming physicality.

As Jules Kambé drove the ball, aggressively pushing through, Liverpool's right flank was left wide open.

His form had been rising tremendously lately. He made eye contact with me and then drove the ball even further.

Michael Robertson, who didn't expect him to go deeper, hastily chased after Kambé.

With his leg muscles seemingly about to burst, Jules Kambé overtook Michael Robertson in an instant.

Since there wasn't much time left, Jules Kambé didn't get greedy.

He showed an unselfish side.

The former Jules Kambé wouldn't have shown a light upper body feint to shake off the hastily following Michael Robertson, making him slide on the field.

At this moment, Jules Kambé was Messi.

And Messi was no different from Jules Kambé.

Then he pretended to break through the center, attempting a slightly short early cross.

Of course, I moved to match that pass.

I took a shot as I quickly ran to the center.

It was just a strong shot, but it was enough to break through the goal guarded by Liverpool's goalkeeper.

A shot so powerful that Alisson Becker, the goalkeeper, couldn't react, hit the net.

-Goooaaaal! Arsenal's winning goooaaal! Mino scores!

-An incredible goal in the 44th minute of the second half! Arsenal’s last-minute gamble pays off!

This is it.

Isn't this why we play strikers?

As soon as I scored the winning goal, I slid towards the direction of the away fans and spread my arms wide.

"Minoooo! You're a god!"

"Woohoohooo!"

"Mino! Mino! Mino! Mino! Mino!"

"The god of Arsenal! Mino! The god of Arsenal! Mino!"

"Hahaha! We won! We beat those Liverpool guys!"

The Gooners who followed us to the away game went wild.

Conversely, the Kop filling Anfield were furious at my goal, throwing all sorts of things.

Oops!

Almost got hit by a water bottle.

These Kop fans don't know. They should be grateful that I was this satisfied.

That I didn't recreate the worst behavior of Coach Gerrard at Brighton.

It's all because I'm nice, right?

"You were thinking something weird again, weren't you?"

"No."

Looking at Lorenzo these days, I think...

I can't tell if this guy is quick-witted... or slow-witted.

Weird guy.

* * *

[Arsenal! 2-1 victory at Anfield!]

[Mino’s winning goal! Secures the team's top position in the league with a stellar performance!]

[Arsenal! Emerges as the strongest title contender!]

[Jurgen Klopp, 'Mino is an outstanding striker. We were poorly prepared.']

[Jules Kambé! Records another assist! Making his mark as a super sub among the Gooners!]

[Now, truly close to the championship! Can Arsenal really achieve an unbeaten season?]

[Arsenal's next opponent is Aston Villa!]

-Let's gooooooo!

-Arsenal! A f*cking great team! A team that will lift the trophy that f*cking Tottenham couldn't!

-Come ooooon! This is it! I even took a leave to go to Merseyside just to see this!

-Mino is a god! Mino is a god! Mino is a god! Mino is a god! Mino is a god!

-We’ve crossed the major hurdle for an unbeaten season. If we get past a few remaining strong teams... Again, the 03-04 season!

After the game.

Seeing Arsenal defeating Liverpool, the Gooners finally began to realize.

After passing the 21st round of the league with not a single defeat, they began to optimistically anticipate an unbeaten season.

And there were those who looked at this enviously.

-Ah... we have Ronaldo too...

-Why are we 3rd in the league? Honestly, our squad is similar to Arsenal's, right?

-It's all because of Coach Hellge.

-Look at Arsenal! As soon as they got a good coach, the team's quality changed immediately! We need to change too!

These were the Manchester United fans.

They voiced their complaints, blaming the long-standing tradition of "blaming the coach" since Alex Ferguson left.

Just as Manchester United’s championship seemed to drift further away,

Arsenal solidified their position as title contenders, reminiscent of the unbeaten season of 03-04.
