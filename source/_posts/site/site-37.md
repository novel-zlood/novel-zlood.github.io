## 16. Value Surge (1)

- RealMilan: Ah...

- LoveMilan: hahahahahahaha

- Monica: hahahahahahaha

- Roberto: hahahahahaha

A woman is being ridiculed.

Her name is Cha Hyerin.

She's a friend of Park Minho.

She's also the girlfriend of Kim Jushik, who uses the nickname 'LoveMilan,' and a very skilled and outstanding temporary project team leader at a startup fragrance company.

Of course, to become a team leader at the age of 25, you need more than just skills.

Her parents are wealthy.

And she has a surprisingly diverse network.

In the end, she benefited quite a lot from that.

Anyway.

Even she, in the face of Inter's defeat, was just a soccer fan who shed tears.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The game ended 2-0.

Although Park Minho didn’t score a hat-trick as he boasted, his shocking performance in the second half already became a staple in the soccer community.

Yes, the Inter she loves became the sacrifice.

Thanks to this, the group chat was filled with friends mocking Inter and her.

Of course, she wasn’t the only one feeling down.

- KingAwesomeJuve: Damn it.

- LoveMilan: Ahahaha

- Roberto: What’s up with him?

- LoveMilan: Juventus also got out in the quarterfinals against AC Milan, just like Inter lolol

- Roberto: hahaha

Lee Sungkyung, a long-time Juventus fan and former chef, also tasted pain.

In this Italian Cup quarterfinal, his beloved Juventus lost 3-2 to AC Milan.

But perhaps the one who suffered the most was Inter, who got beaten up by Park Minho.

- Roberto: I’ll tell you how to easily eat Inter like a cake!

- Roberto: Just recruit some Asian tourists on a club tour, and you can eat Inter like a cake! Hahaha

- LoveMilan: Wow! That’s so informative!

- RealMilan: Stop it...

Cha Hyerin thought.

Today is really the worst.

Her beloved Inter lost helplessly to Parma.

- LoveMilan: Ah! I want to lose to Parma too... But their next opponent is likely to be Atalanta... It can’t be helped.

- LoveMilan: I really wanted to see Minho’s hat-trick too... Ah! So disappointing!

Moreover, her annoying AC Milan fan boyfriend was teasing her merrily in the chat at that moment.

- RealMilan: ...

- LoveMilan: As expected! Great King Park Minho! The pride of the Republic of Korea! The pride of Parma! Awesome!

Other friends were already quietly holding back, but her boyfriend, clueless, kept teasing her.

Crack.

A terrifying sound from her joints.

Of course, her boyfriend couldn’t hear it.

Then.

The main character of the game appeared in the chatroom.

- Park Minho: Really?

- Park Minho: Since I couldn’t score a hat-trick against Inter.

- Park Minho: I’ll definitely beat Atalanta in the semifinals and score a hat-trick in the final against AC Milan.

- LoveMilan: ?

Finally, her boyfriend snapped to attention and spammed the chat.

- LoveMilan: Minho? A hat-trick?

- LoveMilan: In the final? Minho?

- LoveMilan: Why are you suddenly like this? There must be a reason, right? Hmm?

Annoying guy.

You should suffer a bit too.

- RealMilan: Ahaha Inter gets a multi-goal but AC Milan gets a hat-trick haha

Her gloomy mood lifted a bit.

But the news that made Cha Hyerin even happier came soon after.

- KingAwesomeJuve: <News article link>

[Gino Inzaghi coach: ‘Are you asking if I’m interested in Minho after today’s fantastic performance? If you’re asking that now, you should quit being a journalist...’]

[Gino Inzaghi coach: ‘Maybe next season, a powerful resource will be added to our attacking lineup. We still have the funds from selling Lukaku to Chelsea.’]

Everyone was surprised by the rather strong statement from Inter’s coach, Gino Inzaghi, during the post-match press conference.

- Roberto: ?

- Monica: ?

- Roberto: What’s this all of a sudden? So annoying?

- Monica: Our Minho is an Arsenal legend though?

She could feel the confusion from the friends who had been teasing her.

On the contrary, Gino Inzaghi seemed like an incredible manager to her.

Yes, Park Minho is a player who is more than qualified to join the prestigious Inter.

No, he’s a player they must bring in.

As the chatroom became chaotic, she quickly thumbed a message, taunting the others.

Her counterattack had begun.

- RealMilan: What’s Minho’s buyout? Around 27 billion won? With the money we got from selling Jeremy Lukaku to Chelsea, we can buy five Park Minhos?

- Monica: We?

- Roberto: Minho?

- RealMilan: Inter’s eternal legend Park Minho...! Truly, it resonates deeply!

Even though Inter lost the match.

Strangely, Cha Hyerin felt good again.

* * *

What on earth happened?

I woke up from a nap to find 40 massive text bombs from Monica.

Honestly, I was too scared to open them.

And it wasn’t just Monica.

From my parents to anyone I had ever crossed paths with, everyone was contacting me.

My mom told me.

Even scammers recognize me now.

She said that a scammer tried to trick her into doing bank work and left a message saying, ‘I’m a fan of Park Minho. Fighting,’ when he got caught.

I was a bit surprised.

When I asked out of concern.

My mom replied.

In a world where even the social security numbers of politicians are stolen, would they not have information on a guy kicking a ball in Italy?

That’s a bit disheartening.

Anyway.

After listening to my mom, I realized.

My performance has spread quite a bit in Korean communities.

A lot of articles came out too.

[Defending champion of Serie A falls! Inter suffers a shocking 2-0 loss to Parma!]

[Park Minho’s one-man show! The K-Bergkamp that sank Inter!]

[The return of Ronaldinho? Park Minho’s performance was more brilliant and beautiful than any other game!]

[Gino Inzaghi’s love call! Is Park Minho’s next destination Inter?]

[Alain Levagne coach: ‘I feel good about the win.’]

[Coach Alain Levagne, who ended the press conference quickly with a frown despite winning the game, and Gino Inzaghi, who praised Park Minho for five minutes despite losing the game, with a peculiar smile!]

[Big clubs are interested! Park Minho! 14 clubs showed great interest!]

[Comments]

- Wow... That was a real life-changing match.

- Park Minho’s goal against Inter showed his willingness to move to a big club.gif

- The first goal seemed like Bergkamp, and the second like Ronaldinho. Is that normal?

This is quite satisfying.

To be compared to two legends.

Should I frame this comment and hang it up later?

[Comments]

- But isn’t Park Minho’s buyout? Isn’t it expensive?

- Are you clueless about football?

- Let me give you a good comparison. Man U can buy Park Minho by selling Josh Lingard.

- ...?

- What?

- Worth it?

- Josh Lingard’s price = Park Minho’s price?

- Can you swap a football god(?) with a football god?

Is my value the same as that Pied Piper?

This is a bit surprising.

[Comments]

- Is Lingard that expensive?

- Right now, Josh Lingard’s value has shot up to around 30 billion won due to his solid performances when Kaeson Greenwood was injured.

- The. Great. Man. U is waiting for you, Minho!

- Finally... Can we chant ‘Champion Man’ again?

- Man U fans lol They always show up at times like this.

- Ah! Our Minho is going to Man City, though?

- Nope, he’s going to Real.

- Any club with 27 billion won will bid first.

Is my value really that cheap?

I thought I was worth a lot more.

Even Leo expected good offers to come only after this season ended.

Feeling a bit strange, I hurriedly called Leo.

Leo laughed loudly and answered.

- Minho! With your performance in the Inter match, I guarantee that your value will be at least 50 billion won.

- This would be the price if a strict club tried to lower your value, citing your short professional career and stats in Serie B.

- Otherwise... Honestly, I believe your value is close to 100 billion won.

- And this 27 billion won buyout will return to you as your salary.

Leo was very excited.

He said he might be making an incredible salary this summer.

Well, it would be nice to earn a lot of money... but for now, I plan to work hard at Parma.

After defeating Inter and advancing to the Italian Cup semifinals, our next opponent is Atalanta.

If we beat Atalanta, we will face the winner of AC Milan and Lazio in the final.

One more victory there?

It would be my first career championship.

So I have to work even harder.

For Parma’s fans.

And for my career.

* * *

Maybe due to the aftermath of going wild in the Italian Cup quarterfinals against Inter?

In the next league match against Brescia, I ended the game with just one assist.

The team won 4-2.

Kenez scored two goals.

Indeed, it was scary to see him play offensively instead of focusing on defense like in the Inter match.

“Minho!”

“Why?”

“Where will you transfer after this season?”

The trickster asked.

A transfer... I haven’t thought about it yet.

Well, I will eventually, right?

But why is he asking?

Curious, I asked the trickster back, and he smiled and answered.

“Of course, because I want to play with you!”

“With me?”

“Yeah!”

Playing with the trickster... Isn’t bad.

I find it much easier and more comfortable to play with him than with other wingers.

Kenez, who seemed interested, also came closer to listen to our conversation.

A Moai moving like a ninja?

That’s kind of awesome.

“I also want to play with Minho.”

Kenez said with twinkling eyes.

Well, the trickster might find it hard due to his transfer fee, but Kenez could play with me, right?

But honestly, would Parma sell their key striker and winger at the same time unless they’ve gone mad?

Moreover, selling an 18-year-old promising striker would mean they are quitting football.

Besides, Kenez’s Italian has improved remarkably lately.

Now that I think about it, Santiago also set foot in Italy for the first time this season, but his Italian is quite good too?

This is a bit surprising.

So when I asked, he said he had been studying for a long time.

Honestly, except for the trickster slacking off during training, he’s quite a decent guy.

He studies hard.

He often donates to victims of racial discrimination as an apology for the racial discrimination he directed at me before.

He also does a lot of volunteer work.

Is this how a father feels about his son?

I’m quite pleased.

However, unlike the cheerful atmosphere among the players, our coach’s expression is totally gloomy.

I think I know why.

It must be because of my cheap buyout.

I heard our coach lost 3 kg after the Inter match.

Honestly, I thought he was sick.

These days, the way he looks at me is so wistful.

Sometimes it even gives me chills.

Lately, his hair loss seems to be getting worse, and I’m worried.

But there’s nothing I can do.

Ugh... Whatever.

If I keep performing like I did against Inter, our coach will be very happy, right?

So I’ll train even harder.

[Serie B League Standings]

1. Parma: 24 games, 70 points

2. Ternana: 25 games, 45 points

3. Benevento: 25 games, 45 points

4. Cremonese: 25 games, 45 points

5. Brescia: 25 games, 45 points

6. Ascoli: 24 games, 44 points

As the schedule enters mid-February.

The competition for the top spots in Serie B is fiercer than ever.

Even if we skip Parma, who is almost certain to win the league.

The point difference between 2nd and 6th place is only 1 point.

All teams from 2nd to 5th have the same points.

Except for Ternana, the goal difference between 3rd and 6th place is only 1-2 goals, making it a razor-thin competition.

This might go down in Serie B history, where a team could be promoted by fair play points and another could drop to the playoffs.

In such a situation, the upcoming match between Ascoli, for whom every point is precious, and Parma, who wants to win the league undefeated, will take place in a few days.

Unlike other teams, Parma and Ascoli had their match postponed due to a late snowstorm.

So, unlike other teams, they will play their 25th round match on February 19th.

Ascoli.

It’s a team we faced in the league before.

I scored the opening goal then.

A water bottle was thrown at my head during that match.

I still remember it.

It was a very rough match.

There was even a red card.

Because of that, our Parma fans are eagerly waiting for Ascoli’s away match.

I played in the midfield for the first time in that match.

Speaking of which, lately our national team coach Pedro has been intent on using me as a forward.

Park Minho - Shin Junseo - Kang Juwon.

It seems he’s considering using a 4-3-3 formation like this.

Well, I’ll think about that for the Qatar World Cup next year and focus on the league for now.

By the way, it seems Monica feels a sense of crisis.

I chuckled when I saw the text from her after today’s training.

She found 49 reasons why I should transfer to Arsenal and sent them in an Excel file.

So cute.

- Monica: I don’t mind if Minho goes to another team.

- Monica: As long as Minho is happy.

- Monica: But if Minho goes to Tottenham...

- Monica: You know what I mean, right? :)

But the last part is a bit scary.

What kind of club is Tottenham to an Arsenal fan to make her react like this?
