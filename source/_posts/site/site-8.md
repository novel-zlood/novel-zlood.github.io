## 3. A Genius Doesn't Know They're a Genius (2)

A cleanly executed goal completely changed the mood of the first half.

"Confidently shoot forward!"

"Press harder! Go deeper!"

The Genoa coach was fervently trying to regain control of the game that Franco had turned around, sticking close to the technical zone and rallying his players.

"We lost to Lazio and AS Roma in the last friendlies... They must be desperate to win this one."

I nodded in agreement with Gianluca, who was sitting in front of me.

Even though they were just friendlies, losing two games in a row is never good news.

So, they must win this game.

More than that, Franco's movements in the center were definitely worth learning from.

How does he move like that?

As I was pondering this.

Genoa started their counterattack.

Waaah!

A huge cheer erupted from the Genoa fans.

Through strong pressing, they had stolen the ball and brought it right up to Parma's goal line.

Boom!

Deeeeng!

The ball flew over Buffon's head, shaking the goalpost.

A fight for the second ball began, and Genoa, having regained possession, repeatedly targeted Parma's net.

"Gasp!"

But their shots were blocked by Buffon.

Parma's fans cheered at Giovanni Buffon's fantastic save.

"If it continues like this, the first half will end smoothly at 1-0, right?"

Just as Gianluca said, Parma was firmly holding the lead in the first half.

It would probably end at 1-0 unless something major happened.

But life doesn't always go as expected.

Dad always said.

If Mom hadn't asked him, "Do you want to eat together?" that day, he wouldn't have become a married man.

He always wondered why Mom looked so beautiful to him at that moment.

Anyway.

A small incident can completely change the atmosphere of the first half.

"Aaaagh!"

Just like now.

Looking towards the direction of the scream, I saw Franco, the core of the attack, clutching his thigh and lying on the field.

It looked like a serious injury.

Coach Alain Ravin urgently called Santiago.

It seemed he chose Santiago, who had more experience than me, as my body was not yet fully developed as a professional.

Santiago, who was substituted in the 20th minute of the first half, had eyes burning with determination to show his worth this time.

As Franco was carried off the field on a stretcher, Santiago quickly took his place as the attacking midfielder.

A chaotic atmosphere.

Genoa did not leave Parma alone.

Boom!

Smack!

-Waaah!

Parma, whose concentration was broken after Franco's injury, allowed a header during Genoa's corner kick situation.

Even the great Giovanni Buffon couldn't stop the perfectly executed header.

The game was suddenly tied.

Santiago, who was suddenly put into this crisis, played like Zhao Yun from the Three Kingdoms.

His dribbling level was different from when he weighed around 90kg, even though he was now only in the mid-80kg range.

Genoa's defenders couldn't stop him alone.

When Santiago moved with the ball, at least two players had to mark him.

That's how flashy and lethal Santiago's dribbling was.

Honestly, he looked more like a tank than an Argentinian sausage.

Santiago, shaking up Genoa with his different strengths from Franco, created continuous good opportunities.

Gennaro found space to break through as Santiago drew in two players.

It was a good angle to pass to him.

But Santiago made a different choice from Franco.

Instead of passing to Gennaro, who had broken through, he chose to drive himself through the shaking Genoa defense.

Boom!

"Ah!"

The ball soared high.

It was a good opportunity, but Santiago missed it.

But it wasn't disappointing.

His play was fundamentally different from previous games.

At least his play this time had a solid basis.

Santiago had cleverly used Gennaro's movements to create a scoring opportunity for himself.

This wasn't a bad thing.

After all, he created a good chance.

The angle of his shot was also good. Santiago showed the textbook play of an "on-the-ball player."

However.

Santiago was not at the level where he could change the game's flow like Franco.

Genoa's defense easily neutralized Santiago, unlike when facing Franco.

With the momentum, Genoa finally turned the score around to 2-1 in the 44th minute of the first half.

At that moment, the assistant coach called me.

He told me to get ready to be substituted in the second half.

* * *

"Just do what Franco did in the first half. No need to be too nervous."

The coach emphasized repeatedly.

I nodded naturally at Coach Alain Ravin's request.

The coach probably knew.

That even if I couldn't do as well as Franco, I could produce similar results.

"I'll try my best, even if I can't be as good as Franco."

Coach Alain Ravin's expression turned peculiar at my words.

I didn't know why he made such a face.

"Well, do your best."

And so, halftime ended.

I entered the field, sufficiently warmed up.

Seeing me, a few Genoa players started to murmur.

"Who's that Asian guy again?"

"If we push him, he'll easily bounce off."

They were talking about me.

I didn't care much.

My focus was on today's match, which was almost like my professional debut.

Well, the official season debut might feel different.

Beep!

The referee's whistle signaled the start of the second half.

Unlike the first half, both our team and Genoa made several substitutions.

Our forward was vice-captain Gianluca Inglese.

Santiago moved to the left side, instead of the center.

It meant he was playing alongside me for the first time.

Genoa dominated the early part of the second half.

They seemed determined to carry the momentum from the end of the first half into the second.

Their pressing was certainly effective.

We were on the back foot in the early part of the second half.

I knew better than anyone how crucial my position was.

In Coach Alain Ravin's tactics, passes revolve around the attacking midfielder.

The players, knowing that practice and actual games are different, seemed reluctant to burden me.

So, they tried to play through the flanks rather than the center.

I think I understood why Santiago wasn't substituted but moved to the flank.

Seeing this, the Genoa players smirked at me.

But it didn't matter to me.

Whether practice or actual game.

There wasn't much difference, except for being a bit more nervous.

Genoa, excited by their good momentum from the end of the first half, pushed up their lines quite a bit.

Even with my inexperience, I could tell they weren't paying attention to me.

So, I'll show them through my actions.

That I'm no joke.

As I moved slightly towards the halfway line, Wilan Cyprien, our central midfielder who was passing the ball quickly, noticed me.

He initially sent the ball to the flank and then showed me one finger.

So... does that mean he's going to pass to the center and cut in?

I remembered it as Pattern A among our pattern plays.

Naturally, I moved accordingly.

The ball returned from the flank, and Wilan Cyprien sent it straight to me.

Tuk!

Finally, I made my first touch in today's match.

* * *

Seeing the inexperienced Park Minho moving proactively, some people nodded.

Not a bad play.

"Even though it's a friendly, it's practically his first match as a professional... He's very composed."

"Hmm..."

Just as the assistant coach said, Park Minho was composed.

Coach Alain Ravin also nodded in satisfaction as he watched.

"There are many promising players who get stiff and make ridiculous mistakes when the team is struggling... But Mino is different."

"Maybe it's because he's a late-blooming prospect at 24?"

"Could be."

It wasn't bad.

Given the news from the team doctor that Franco's injury might sideline him for at least 4 to 6 weeks.

They had no choice but to rely on Santiago and Park Minho for the early part of the season.

"Good."

Park Minho received the ball lightly, turned, and sent a forward pass.

Wilan Cyprien, who returned the pass, drove deep.

It was Parma's first chance in the early part of the second half.

But Wilan Cyprien's touch was too long.

The ball stretched out, and Genoa's defender easily cleared it.

Or so he thought.

Whack!

"Ugh!"

The poorly cleared ball was captured by Park Minho.

"He's fast!"

Just as the assistant coach exclaimed.

Park Minho quickly penetrated Genoa's defense as soon as he got the ball.

His dribbling was clumsier than Santiago's.

But his speed was exceptional.

"Ooh! He’s fast! He’s fast!"

"Who's number 27?"

"Run! Run!"

The eyes of Parma's fans were fixed on Park Minho.

At that moment, Park Minho, with explosive acceleration, dodged another player and tore through Genoa's defense.

Genoa's players, flustered, hurriedly responded.

But Park Minho's eyes were already on the open space behind Genoa's defense.

* * *

During my middle school years.

There was a friend named Baek Seunghoon in our football club, who was nicknamed the Korean Messi.

Then there was Lee Jinsu, the greatest genius striker in the middle school league, scoring three goals every match.

Hwang Junchan, who was set to become a future national team fullback.

And Kim Siwon, the heir to the Spider Hand.

Our middle school boasted incredible talents.

I couldn't catch up with them.

When I achieved one thing, they absorbed at least three to ten things.

But there were even greater geniuses in high school.

Baek Seunghoon, who was called the Korean Messi in middle school, became just a small backup winger in high school.

Lee Jinsu, who scored three goals every match, scored only one goal in two years.

Hwang Junchan, who was said to be the future national team fullback, realized the gap in talent and quit football.

Kim Siwon, the heir to the Spider Hand, became the third-choice goalkeeper.

Seeing this, I thought.

We were frogs in a well.

High school was even more impressive.

There were real geniuses like senior Lee Myungsoo, who was called up to U-19 and even U-23.

There was also Kim Woojin, a junior who easily caught balls, making the Spider Hand look trivial.

Lastly, there was senior Shin Junseo, the best output of our high school.

When they took three to five steps forward at once, I could only take one step.

So I gave up.

I felt the difference in talent was too great.

Since I was good at studying, I decided to take up football as a hobby.

But looking back now, I don't think I was entirely without talent.

When Baek Seunghoon, who was called the Korean Messi in middle school, became a backup winger for three years in high school.

I gradually increased my playing time and, by my senior year, I was alternating between starting and rotating.

Moreover, before entering university, a few K2 League scouts contacted me...

I don't think I lacked talent.

If I hadn't heard the news later, I might not have given up on football and gone to the military.

I heard that all those impressive seniors and juniors failed to join professional clubs except for senior Shin Junseo and senior Lee Myungsoo.

Honestly, I still can't believe it.

That those extraordinary people failed.

Well... because of that news, I was able to cleanly let go of my lingering attachment to football as a university student.

Since even those great geniuses failed like that.

I thought there was no way a slow-growing turtle like me could survive in the pros.

So, I decided to keep football as a hobby.

I made up my mind.

Still, when I heard that senior Shin Junseo, our high school's best output, joined Tottenham after I returned from the military, I felt a bit restless.

That tiny bit of regret tugged at my heart.

"Huff! Huff!"

"Mino! Left!"

But it's okay now.

A late opportunity has come my way.

And I'm determined to give my all to this opportunity.

Of course, I still have doubts about my talent.

Even in this Parma club, there are more talented players.

When I barely learn one thing, they quickly learn two or three.

But.

I'll try to challenge myself.

Just a little bit more.

Tuk!

"Block him!"

Yeah.

I don't think I'm completely without talent.

Smack!

"Woohoo! Crazy! That's insane! Insane!"

"Perfect timing, Mino!"

Gianluca Inglese, who scored from my pass, ran over and hugged me tightly.

"Hahaha! Mino! You're the best! The best!"

"Really? I'm glad. I tried to imitate Franco, but it wasn't easy."

"What? Is that something you can just imitate?"

"It's not perfect... but I managed somewhat. Still, I think I'm lacking a lot. I need to work harder."

Huh? Why are they looking at me like I'm a monster?

Gianluca shook his head after hearing my response.

"That's why geniuses are..."

"Sometimes this guy is really annoying, you know?"

"All geniuses are like that."

"At least he's on our team. If he was on the opposing team and kept hitting our goal like that and said those things? I'd punch him immediately."

The team members shook their heads while looking at me.

I didn't perfectly imitate Franco...

Why are they calling me a genius here?

Was this play really worth praising?

I think I'm still lacking a lot.
