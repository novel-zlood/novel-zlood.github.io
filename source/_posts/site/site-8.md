## 3. A Genius Doesn't Know They're a Genius (2)

A cleanly executed goal completely changed the atmosphere of the first half.

"Confidently shoot forward!"

"Press harder! Go deeper!"

The Genoa coach clung to the technical zone, passionately trying to rally the Genoa players to regain the momentum that Franco had overturned.

"We lost to Lazio and AS Roma in the previous friendlies... They will want to win this match by any means."

I nodded involuntarily at Gianluca's words, who was sitting in front of me.

No matter how friendly the match, losing two consecutive games is never good news.

So, they must win this match.

More than that, Franco's movements in the center were definitely worth learning from.

How does he move like that?

While I was pondering.

This time, Genoa launched a counterattack.

Waaaah!

A huge cheer erupted from the Genoa crowd.

They pressed hard and stole the ball, quickly bringing it to the edge of Parma's penalty area.

Boom!

Thud!

The ball shook the goalpost, flying over Buffon's head.

A battle for the second ball ensued, and Genoa, who regained possession, repeatedly targeted Parma's net.

"Gasp!"

However, their shots were blocked by Buffon.

Parma fans cheered at Giovanni Buffon's fantastic save.

"If it continues like this, the first half will smoothly end at 1-0."

Just like Gianluca said, Parma was clearly dominating the first half.

It would likely end 1-0 unless something major happened.

But life doesn't go as predicted.

My father used to say.

If my mother hadn't said, 'Do you want to eat together?' that day, he wouldn't have become a married man.

He used to wonder why she looked so pretty at that moment.

Anyway.

A small trigger can completely change the atmosphere of the first half.

"Aaaargh!"

Yes, just like now.

Looking towards the source of the scream, I saw Franco, the key player in the attack, clutching his thigh and collapsing on the field.

It looked like a serious injury.

Coach Alain Levagne urgently called for Santiago.

It seemed he chose Santiago, who had more experience than me, who had yet to fully develop as a pro.

Santiago, who was subbed in around the 20th minute of the first half, had a burning determination in his eyes, ready to show his worth.

As Franco was carried off the field on a stretcher, Santiago quickly took his position as an attacking midfielder.

The atmosphere was chaotic.

Genoa didn't let Parma be.

Boom!

Thwack!

-Waaaah!

Parma, whose concentration broke after Franco's injury, allowed a header during Genoa's corner kick.

Even the great Giovanni Buffon couldn't block the clean header that came from a perfect situation.

The score was quickly tied.

Santiago, who was suddenly subbed in, fought fiercely to overcome the crisis.

He was like Zhao Yun from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

Even though he weighed in the mid-80kg range, his dribbling was different from when he weighed 90kg.

Genoa's defenders couldn't stop him alone.

When Santiago dribbled the ball, at least two players had to mark him.

His dribbling was that dazzling and lethal.

Honestly, he looked more like a tank than an Argentine sausage.

Santiago, with his different strengths from Franco, repeatedly created good opportunities, shaking Genoa.

Gennaro exploited the space created as Santiago drew in two players.

If he passed to Gennaro, it would have been a good angle.

But Santiago made a different choice from Franco.

After Gennaro's move, he chose to directly push through the shaking Genoa defense.

Boom!

"Ah!"

The ball soared high.

It was a good opportunity, but Santiago missed it regrettably.

However, it wasn't disappointing.

His play was clearly grounded, unlike in previous games.

Santiago skillfully used Gennaro's movement to create a scoring chance.

It wasn't a bad thing.

Eventually, he created a good opportunity.

The angle of his shot was good too. Santiago demonstrated the textbook play of an 'on-the-ball player.'

But.

Santiago wasn't at the level to change the game's flow like Franco.

Genoa's defense easily neutralized Santiago, unlike when dealing with Franco.

And Genoa, who gained momentum, managed to reverse the score to 2-1 in the 44th minute of the first half.

Then, the assistant coach called me.

He told me to prepare to be subbed in for the second half.

* * *

"Just do what Franco showed in the first half. There's no need to be too nervous."

He emphasized repeatedly.

I nodded involuntarily at Coach Alain Levagne's request.

The coach probably knew too.

That even if I couldn't match Franco's level, I could produce a similar result.

"I'll try my best, even if I can't match Franco."

Coach Alain Levagne's expression turned strange at my words.

I didn't know why he made that face.

"Well, alright... Do your best."

And so, halftime ended.

I stepped onto the field, moderately warmed up.

Some Genoa players whispered among themselves as they looked at me.

"Who's that Asian guy?"

"If we push him with our bodies, heâ€™ll easily bounce off."

They were talking about me.

I didn't pay much attention to it.

My focus was entirely on today's match, which was practically my pro debut.

Well, the regular season debut might feel different.

Beep!

The referee's whistle signaled the start of the second half.

Unlike the first half, many players on both our team and Genoa had changed.

Our frontman was the vice-captain, Gianluca Inglese.

Santiago moved to the left wing instead of the center.

It meant he would be playing with me for the first time.

Genoa dominated the early part of the second half.

It seemed they wanted to carry the momentum from the end of the first half into the second half.

Their pressing was effective.

We were being dragged around in the early part of the second half.

I knew how important my position was.

In Coach Alain Levagne's tactics, the play revolved around the attacking midfielder.

The players seemed reluctant to put too much pressure on me, knowing that practice and matches are different.

So, they tried to break through from the wings rather than the center.

I also guessed why Santiago wasn't subbed out and moved to the wing.

Seeing that, Genoa's players smirked at me.

But it made no difference to me.

Whether practice or a match.

The only difference was a bit more tension.

Genoa, excited by the good atmosphere from the end of the first half, pushed their lines up.

Even with my lack of experience, I could tell they weren't paying attention to me.

So, I decided to show them.

That I wasn't someone to be taken lightly.

As I moved slightly towards the halfway line, Parma's central midfielder, Wylan Cyprien, noticed me.

He sent the ball to the wing first and then showed me a finger.

So... that signal meant to pass to the center and turn back in, right?

I remembered it as pattern play, pattern A.

Of course, I moved accordingly.

The ball, which had gone to the wing, came back to Wylan Cyprien, who immediately passed it to me.

Tap!

Finally, I got my first touch of the match.

* * *

Some nodded at the sight of the inexperienced Park Minho moving proactively.

Not a bad play.

"Even if it's a friendly, it's practically his first professional match... He's very composed."

"Hmm..."

Like the assistant coach said, Park Minho was calm.

Coach Alain Levagne also nodded in satisfaction as he watched him.

"There are many promising players who make ridiculous mistakes in difficult times for the team... But Minho is different."

"Well, maybe it's because he's a late bloomer at 24."

"Perhaps."

It wasn't bad.

Considering the news that Franco's injury would sideline him for at least four weeks to a maximum of six weeks.

It was inevitable that the early season would have to be handled by Santiago and Park Minho.

"Good."

Park Minho received the ball lightly, turned his body, and made a forward pass.

Wylan Cyprien, who received the return, penetrated deeply.

Parma's first opportunity in the early part of the second half.

But Wylan Cyprien's touch was too long.

The ball stretched out, and a Genoa defender easily cleared it.

Or so he thought.

Smack!

"Ugh!"

Park Minho intercepted the poorly cleared ball.

"He's fast!"

As the assistant coach exclaimed.

Park Minho quickly started to break through Genoa's defense upon receiving the ball.

Compared to Santiago, his dribbling was rough.

But his speed was exceptional.

"Oooooh! He's fast! He's fast!"

"Who's that number 27?"

"Run! Run!"

Parma fans' eyes were on Park Minho.

At that moment, Park Minho accelerated explosively, cutting through Genoa's defense by dodging another player.

Genoa's players, who were taken aback, responded hastily.

But Park Minho's gaze was already fixed on the empty space behind Genoa.

* * *

In my middle school days.

There was a friend in our football team named Baek Seunghoon, who was nicknamed the Korean Messi.

And Jinsu Lee, the middle school league's top genius striker, who scored three goals every match.

Hwang Junchan, who was expected to be a future national team fullback.

And Kim Siwon, the heir of the Spider Hand.

Our middle school had incredible geniuses.

I couldn't catch up with them.

When I achieved one thing, they learned at least three or as many as ten.

But there were even more incredible geniuses in high school.

Baek Seunghoon, who was called the Korean Messi in middle school, became a backup winger due to his short height in high school.

Jinsu Lee, who used to score three goals every match, only scored one goal in two years.

Hwang Junchan, who was expected to be a future national team fullback, realized the gap in talent and quit football.

Kim Siwon, the heir of the Spider Hand, was pushed to become the third-choice goalkeeper.

Seeing that, I thought.

We were frogs in a well.

High school was more impressive.

There was a genuine genius like Myungsoo Lee, who was called up for U-19 and U-23.

There was Kim Woojin, a junior who caught the ball effortlessly, putting Spider Hand to shame.

And lastly, there was Junseo Shin, the highest output of our high school.

When they took three to five steps at a time, I could only take one step.

So, I gave up.

I felt the gap in talent too much.

Since I was fairly good at studying, I decided to keep football as a hobby.

But now that I think about it, maybe I wasn't entirely lacking in talent.

When Baek Seunghoon, who was called the Korean Messi in middle school, became a backup winger for three years in high school.

I gradually increased my playtime and became a regular rotation player by the time I was a senior.

Moreover, before entering college, a few K2 League scouts approached me...

It seems I wasn't entirely devoid of talent.

If it weren't for the news I heard after entering university, I might not have given up on football and gone to the army.

I might have seriously reconsidered playing football.

Hearing that those supposedly great seniors and juniors, except for Junseo Shin and Myungsoo Lee, all failed to join pro teams...

Maybe I got scared too soon.

Honestly, I still can't believe it.

The failure of those great people.

Well... Because of that news, I was able to completely let go of any lingering feelings as a university student.

Even those great geniuses failed.

I thought I couldn't survive in the pros, growing at a turtle's pace.

I decided to keep football as a hobby.

I made that resolution.

But after coming back from the army, hearing that our high school's top output, Junseo Shin, joined Tottenham made me feel a bit restless.

A tiny bit of regret tugged at my heart.

"Huff! Huff!"

"Minho! Left!"

But now it's okay.

A late opportunity has come to me again.

And I plan to give it my all.

Of course, I'm still not confident in my talent.

There are friends in this Parma team who have more talent than me.

When I barely master one thing, they quickly learn two to three things.

But.

Just a little...

I'll take on the challenge, just a little.

Tap!

"Stop him!"

Yes.

It seems I'm not entirely talentless.

Thud!

"Wooaaah! Crazy! That's insane!"

"The timing was perfect! Minho!"

Gianluca Inglese, who scored from my pass, ran towards me and hugged me tightly.

"Ha ha ha! Minho! You're the best! The best!"

"Really? That's a relief. I tried to mimic Franco, but it's not easy."

"What? Is that something you can just mimic?"

"It's not perfect... But I managed somehow. I still lack a lot. I need to work harder."

What's this? Why are they looking at me like I'm a monster?

Gianluca shook his head after hearing my answer.

"That's why geniuses are..."

"Sometimes this guy is annoyingly smug, you know?"

"All geniuses are like that."

"Well, he's on our team, so we can tolerate him. If he were on the opposing team and said something like that after pounding our goalpost, I would've punched him."

My teammates shook their heads as they looked at me.

I didn't perfectly mimic Franco...

Why are they calling me a genius here?

Was this play really worth praising?

I think I'm still lacking a lot.
