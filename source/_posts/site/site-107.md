## 40. Watch My Soccer Lecture DVD! (2)

The first goal was scored.

A few West Ham players, observing my behavior, looked at me with displeasure.

- Ah, if you're upset, why don't you score a goal too?

If there's anyone who thinks like this, I firmly believe they should check into a mental hospital.

Seeing the West Ham Irons glaring at me with terrifying eyes, I decided to stop my light (?) provocation and focus on the game again.

I am an ordinary citizen who knows the value of my life.

As an Arsenal striker with a foxy Monica waiting at home, I quietly lowered my gaze.

"Minho, do you think you can go home safely today?"

I couldn't readily answer Bernard Party's question.

Honestly, today's provocation was a bit impulsive, but seeing that there were no words, I realized I had narrowly avoided crossing the line.

Anyway.

As soon as the opening goal was scored, the home fans filling London Stadium began to hurl rough jeers.

This was even somewhat subdued.

Normally, it wouldn't be surprising if all sorts of filth were thrown at me, but due to recent fines and sanctions in European football for such behavior, the fans refrained from throwing anything unless they were extremely furious.

However, I did feel a bit sorry seeing the tears in the eyes of a young West Ham Irons fan glaring at me from afar.

Anyway.

The game resumed.

West Ham came out a bit more aggressively than before, trying to close the score gap.

After all, this is London Stadium, and they can't just show a dragged-down appearance.

It was a predictable move.

- West Ham seems unable to exert power against Arsenal's offensive until the mid-first half.

- A slightly hesitant West Ham! But they need to come out more aggressively! This is their home, London Stadium!

They were clearly angry.

West Ham's players became rougher.

Thanks to that, I had kissed the field three times since the game resumed.

Well, I understood to some extent.

Since I was somewhat responsible for the current situation, I had no choice but to endure quietly.

But that didn't mean I would just take the hits.

This time, I planned to be the bait.

They had already conceded a goal to me, so if they allowed an additional goal to someone unexpected... How delighted would that young West Ham fan be to the point of tears?

What?

Isn't this too diabolical a thought?

Can I take that as a compliment?

The ball was back in my possession.

Alright, this time I planned to give West Ham a lecture on 'key plays'.

* * *

Lloyd Melley thought.

That Arsenal number 10 is truly insane.

Not just his personality, but his skills were insane too.

‘I heard he wasn't originally like this... What on earth made him this way?’

Lloyd Melley thought it might be the rough environment of the Italian league that turned him this way.

Or maybe he was originally crazy, and he was just now showing his true colors.

Anyway.

That monstrous player, after scoring a goal, slowed down a bit, coordinating the team from the central second line and shaking West Ham's defense.

It was different from the Park Minho he had analyzed.

But Lloyd Melley felt the presence of another player in his movements.

‘Those movements are like...’

They felt a lot like Harriet Kane, Tottenham's ace and England's national striker.

Harriet Kane is also an all-round striker who comes down to deep positions to help in defense and link-up play, not just playing at the forefront.

Honestly, Lloyd Melley, who had been brimming with confidence throughout the season, felt his confidence wane as he faced Park Minho.

The difference felt more and more as time passed.

But Lloyd Melley didn't give up.

He clung persistently to Park Minho to prevent him from being more actively involved in Arsenal's attack.

Even though his movements brought some confusion to West Ham's defense, Lloyd Melley believed his thoughts were correct.

No, it wasn't just his thoughts.

Coach David Butler and the other players also thought it was worth taking some team risk to block Park Minho.

However, after scoring the opening goal, Park Minho started to escape as soon as Lloyd Melley actively approached.

To be precise, he began to emphasize link-up play more.

And Park Minho's passes, focused on link-up play, began to slowly shake West Ham's defense.

- Minho's pass goes deep into the center!

- The ball connects to Axel Odegaard!

The ball connecting to Axel.

As soon as he caught the ball, he quickly passed it with a heel kick to a player West Ham had missed.

- Jake Francis!

- He shoots right away!

- Goooooooal! Arsenal scores an additional goal in the 37th minute of the first half, making it 2-0!

- It was perfect teamwork! Starting with Minho's key play, Axel's heel kick, and Jake's finish.

- You can clearly see why Arsenal is a strong team from that play. Amazing!

Lloyd Melley, looking at Arsenal's attacking line with a dumbfounded expression, muttered to himself.

"He's not lacking compared to Harriet Kane..."

In some aspects, he was even better.

That's why the goal hurt more, and at the same time, it was painful to think about how to block such a player for the remaining time.

Boooooooo!

Fxxk! We came to see you win!

This is the worst game! Fxxking game!

Fxxk! Damn it!

West Ham fans.

You can hear the jeers and curses from the Irons.

It also meant that West Ham was shaken throughout the first half.

Thus, the first half ended with West Ham shaken.

But that didn't mean West Ham staged a comeback in the second half.

The second half was similar.

Arsenal continued their offensive.

West Ham defended and looked for chances to take quick counter-shots.

However, what set the two teams apart was their finishing ability.

West Ham had quite a few chances, but the number of properly finished shots was quite low.

"Damn it..."

When a player collapsed on the field, causing a temporary lull in the game.

Lloyd Melley, with a tired expression, approached Park Minho, whom he had been marking, and said.

"Please... Stop moving around."

His complaint was a compliment to Park Minho, who had become a nearly perfect attacker with fully matured stamina compared to his Parma days.

Of course, Park Minho responded to his compliment.

- Minho! Minho! As soon as the game resumes, he persistently targets West Ham's center!

- Lloyd Melley! He struggles to keep up again! But Minho is faster!

- Amazing! Minho! He doesn't show any signs of tiring even in the second half!

Park Minho, dribbling the ball forward.

West Ham's defense, highly tense, kept their eyes on his feet.

And.

While everyone's attention was on his feet, Jake Francis, who had scored an additional goal in today's game, ran up to a high position again and raised his hand.

"Minho!"

Without hesitation, Park Minho passed the ball into the open space.

Today's goal wasn't to score a lot.

It was to give a football lecture to West Ham.

He had scored a goal and recorded a key play.

So now, it was time to record an assist.

Thud!

The lightly kicked ball cut through the field and reached Jake Francis's foot.

Jake Francis controlled the ball with one touch and, without delay, took a shot.

Jake Francis's powerful shot, which had already ravaged Denker Parines' goal today, hit the net again.

- Goooooooal!

- Minho's fantastic assist! And Jake Francis scores his debut multi-goal!

- Amazing! Arsenal! Maintaining dominance throughout the game, they now widen the score gap to 3 goals!

- Arsenal is strong!

Lloyd Melley couldn't hide his frustration as he looked at West Ham's defense, which had allowed another goal in vain.

He didn't expect Arsenal to perform this well this season.

Last season.

Arsenal barely secured 5th place in the league.

Such a team is now unbeaten until December.

With a squad close to 1.5-tier.

Despite having several main players on the bench, Arsenal overwhelmed West Ham.

Watching that, Lloyd Melley thought.

The Arsenal transfer he had contemplated this summer.

He should seriously consider it this winter.

And if the Arsenal transfer fails, he should definitely flee to another league.

* * *

[Park Minho! A stellar performance with 1 goal and 1 assist!]

[Minho moves like Tottenham's Harriet Kane! Leads Arsenal to a 3-0 victory!]

[Minho showcases his skills against West Ham! Demonstrates 'This is revenge!' perfectly!]

[Second video on SNS! West Ham fans enraged with Minho's U-10 special lecture saying 'This is a pass, and this is a shot.']

[Minho crushes racial discrimination with skill! Showcases his talent in the EPL!]

[This year's Ballon d'Or ceremony to be announced on December 13!]

[From Thierry Mbappe to Minho to Haaland! Bookmakers are sure this year's Ballon d'Or will be a three-way race!]

[We are now entering the era of Mbappe-Minho-Haaland in football history.]

- Minhooooooooo!

- He managed to record 1 goal and 1 assist even against West Ham.

- Minho is a god! Minho is a god! Minho is a god! Minho is a god! Minho is a god! Minho is a god!

- This year's Ballon d'Or is quite late.

- It can't be helped. There have been many incidents.

- Did you watch Minho's football lecture? It's already out up to part 3!

- Stupid Irons! Don't they know that mocking Minho only brings defeat?

- If they knew... would they have supported West Ham?

-(Realization)

- What's this? What's with the weird picture above?

- Isn't that Korean?

- Damn! Annoying North Korean! Get lost to your country! Don't want to see you!

- Are you a West Ham fan? For reference, Minho is from South Korea, not North Korea!

As soon as the game ended, we safely left London Stadium with the help of the London police.

Still, it wasn't as bad as the North London derby, so it wasn't too scary.

My first North London derby was that impressive.

I was worried about the away game at Tottenham in the second half, watching the Tottenham players returning by bus.

Anyway.

We gained momentum by defeating West Ham.

The team atmosphere was really good.

The negative issues about me also quieted down a bit.

However, there was another issue.

Right... The Ballon d'Or ceremony was waiting for me.

Overall, my stats were slightly superior, but this year Thierry Mbappe achieved a treble.

League, Copa del Rey, Champions League.

Real Madrid's 22-23 season was prosperous.

It was a much better team achievement than the mini-treble I achieved at the end of my Parma days.

And as expected, the 2023 Ballon d'Or winner was Thierry Mbappe.

I was second.

Ethan Haaland was third.

I didn't have any particularly memorable conversations with the two world-class players I met for the first time at this Ballon d'Or ceremony, which was a bit disappointing.

It couldn't be helped.

Due to various circumstances, this Ballon d'Or ceremony was quite simplified compared to others.

There wasn't even time to talk to other players.

Much like the chaotic atmosphere in Europe due to the conflicts that erupted right after the end of the pandemic, the ceremony also felt somewhat subdued.

But from the next ceremony onwards, it is said to return to its former glory... Maybe then we can enjoy it like a true festival?

On the flight back to the club after the ceremony, I quietly closed my eyes.
