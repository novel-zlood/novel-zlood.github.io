## 4. Pro Debut (3)

The moment the equalizing goal was scored.

The players of Ternana felt their energy drain.

They had expended their energy early in the game to score the first goal and had planned to calmly block Parma's offensive line, who were trailing 1-0, and then counterattack in the second half.

But with just one shot, all their preparations went awry.

"Mino! Mino! Mino! Mino!"

The debut goal of a 24-year-old late bloomer erupted.

The home fans filling Parma's home stadium, Ennio Tardini, kept shouting the name of the rookie.

- What an amazing goal. He didn't miss the small shooting angle that the opponent allowed.

- It's incredible. Are you saying this player was doing something else until he was 24 instead of playing soccer? It's really surprising.

- Now, Ternana needs to regroup and prepare for the second half. They pushed hard for the first 20 minutes of the first half, so they are inevitably at a physical disadvantage compared to Parma.

- The score is still tied. If they hold on and hold on, opportunities will definitely come.

"It's okay! Focus!"

Ternana's coach shouted tirelessly.

Since the score was still 1-1.

There was definitely an opportunity for Ternana as well.

"Coach, I think we need to assign David to that number 24 Asian player. Because of him, Parma's offensive is getting stronger."

Nodding reluctantly at the assistant coach's advice, he shouted to Ternana's midfielder, David Gavazzi.

"David! Mark number 24!"

Whether he heard the shout correctly, David Gavazzi nodded and stuck to Park Minho.

(Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!)

(They are the Crusaders and all champions!)

(The heroes are the players of Parma!)

The enthusiastic home fans of Parma.

To block the players of Parma, who were gaining momentum, the overall abilities of the promoted team Ternana were lacking.

The overall possession and pressure of Ternana began to decrease, while Parma started to completely dominate the time between the 30th and 40th minutes of the first half.

- Oh! Mino is doing so much for the team in the center. Who would see this player as a 24-year-old rookie making his debut match?

- The ball flows back to the center!

- Mino has the ball! He's fast!

Ternana, losing their momentum, just tried to disrupt the opponent's flow with rough play.

If done wrong, they could give the opponent a good chance, but by provoking the opponent just a little, they could change the flow instead.

Ternana was that desperate.

As Park Minho gave the ball to Santiago running up the touchline and then cut back into the center, Ternana's defense wavered.

"Block the center!"

"Mark number 24! Mark number 24!"

The marker, David Gavazzi, paused for a moment.

Because Park Minho, who was running forward, stopped.

Eventually, switching with central midfielder Marjan Kurtić, Park Minho backed off.

He hesitated for a moment.

Should he block Marjan Kurtić, who was cutting into the dangerous area, or should he keep marking number 24?

That brief hesitation created a gap.

Boom!

The ball soared high.

Santiago's cross accurately connected with Gennaro Tatis' head in the center.

- Gennaro Tatis!

- Oh! The goalkeeper Titas Krapikas barely deflected the ball! He saves Ternana from danger!

- It's a corner kick situation. It's not over yet.

In a normal situation, it would have been a goal.

Did the spirit of Yashin possess the Ternana goalkeeper?

A perfect chance was blocked.

"Ahhh!"

Gennaro Tatis grabbed his head.

Step, step.

Park Minho moved to take the corner kick.

Gennaro Tatis, filled with regret.

In an instant, he saw Park Minho raise his hand and show three fingers, and his eyes sparkled.

It was a signal to execute a short pattern play they had trained for set pieces.

Gennaro Tatis moved slightly outward and then moved behind the defender marking him.

The fullback who could see him didn’t seem to care much.

Park Minho raised his hand high.

His beautiful corner kick flew towards the goal of Ternana.

'It's here!'

Gennaro was sure it would be a goal.

The ball dropped precisely near his head as he rounded the defender.

Because it was a whip-like path, there was a contest between the defender's foot and his head.

But he didn't pull his head back.

Instead, he boldly pushed it in.

Thwack!

Swoosh!

- Goal!

- Gennaro Tatis! Tatis scores with determination! It was a dangerous situation! But he put his head in!

- The defender's foot was slightly high, but conversely, Gennaro Tatis was also very bold.

The torn uniform from the defender’s studs.

The red scratch visible through the torn uniform, but Gennaro Tatis didn't care.

"Uaaaaah!"

He ran like a bull and raised both fists towards the stands.

* * *

Halftime.

Gennaro, who scored the go-ahead goal, changed his uniform and sang Parma's cheer song excitedly.

It's really fortunate that he’s in high spirits, but honestly, I was very surprised earlier.

Because it was a situation where he could have been seriously injured.

But Gennaro didn't care much.

When I asked him, Gennaro grinned.

"What? Wasn’t it dangerous?"

"No, not at all. Sometimes, a man has to follow his heart even if death approaches."

"Hahaha! The king of Parma! Gennaro is invincible!"

Perhaps the adrenaline was really kicking in, as he walked around the locker room excitedly.

Coach Alain Lavagne muttered, "It’s too dangerous. What if I become more famous than Klopp or Pep?"

Giovanni Buffon, the team’s core, was struggling to manage the excited players.

But.

These days, our coach seems to be in the final stages of ‘great coach syndrome.’

The only fortunate thing is that he has the ability.

If he had no ability and was suffering from great coach syndrome?

That's really hopeless.

My father, who enjoys watching football, used to curse Tottenham's ‘Nuno Espirito Santo’ for that.

He said he had great coach syndrome.

Anyway.

The flow in the first half was really good.

There were no special instructions.

Just, "Don’t lose your cool even if the opponent plays rough. But don’t be a pushover either."

It meant to engage physically but avoid fouls.

After eating a banana, I was thinking about how to approach the second half.

Then Santiago, who came up to me, gave me a thumbs up.

"You were fantastic today! Mino."

As expected.

When you lose weight, your mentality also strengthens.

Isn’t there a saying like that?

A healthy mind in a healthy body.

As I lost weight and got back in form, peace came over my face, which was always grumpy.

Can that Argentine sausage and this handsome South American guy be the same person?

It’s really a mystery.

"Yeah, thank you."

"Maybe today we’ll see the opponent’s fans light flares."

Opponent’s flares...

How many goals do we need to score to see that?

"Arthur... For that, we’d need to make at least a 4-goal difference. Besides, if flares are lit, the fans who lit them are banned from the stadium for 3 years, and the team they support gets fined."

Gianluca chimed in.

"I heard we paid about 5,200 euros last time. Our passionate fans lit a flare during a friendly match."

5,200 euros?

That's close to 7 million won.

"5,200 euros..."

Should I really give it my all?

Create a 4-goal difference in the second half to make flares go off in the away section.

Seeing my expression, Giovanni shook his head.

"Mino, let’s just play a normal game, please."

* * *

Second half.

After halftime, Ternana tried to score an equalizer during the chaotic time.

They attempted a strong press like in the early first half.

They certainly had good chances.

But no goals came out.

Parma was not a team naive enough to fall for the same play twice.

After all, they were in Serie A last year.

Simultaneously, Ternana, who raised their line, faced retribution for their arrogance.

Thwack!

- Goal!

- Marjan Kurtić's long shot scores! The score is now 3-1!

Marjan’s shot from quite a distance flew sharply through a gap and shook the net.

Honestly, I didn't think it would work...

Ternana’s defender momentarily lost concentration and allowed space.

Of course, Marjan Kurtić wouldn’t miss that.

The fans in the away section were hurling harsh jeers, criticizing their team.

Saying it was too easy.

Honestly, I didn’t expect it, but it looks like flares might actually go off in the away section.

The score is now 3-1.

We became more relaxed.

Conversely, Ternana had to catch up with a 2-goal difference.

The urgent Ternana players couldn't overcome their impatience and pressed us more roughly than before.

Whistle! Whistle!

"Ah!"

As soon as I got the ball, I tasted some grass.

Parma is really a place for tasting grass.

It’s very bitter.

"That was too dangerous. Be cautious."

"I’m sorry. You too, sorry."

At the apology of the opponent who committed the rough foul, I lightly raised my hand.

It was understandable.

A 2-goal difference is hard to catch up with in just 40 minutes.

But this is not right.

What’s the use of apologizing?

They tore my eyes.

Santiago got angry in my stead and confronted the guy who fouled me.

But the opponent just sneered and backed off.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah, it didn't go in deep."

"I didn't even call him a monkey, but I didn’t tear his eyes... That guy is really rotten."

Oh! Santiago!

That’s the same thing.

Seeing my disapproving face, Santiago awkwardly scratched his head.

Kid.

At least you know it was your fault.

I forgive your sin.

Anyway.

The game resumed.

Ternana’s defenders again committed rough fouls against me and Santiago, the team’s key players.

Seeing them restrain themselves with other players...

It was clearly a strategy to target the aces.

It seems like a tough debut match.

If not for the shin guards, one leg would have definitely been broken.

But I didn’t just take it.

I gave back as much as I got.

You tore my eyes.

I will enlarge your eyes.

This time, I moved a bit selfishly.

- Mino! Receives the ball and runs!

- David Gavazzi, who has been marking Mino, rushes to him!

I bypassed the Italian mafia-looking man who had been marking me and cut in front of the defender who had fouled me and torn my eyes.

Are you off guard now?

He gave me space.

By mistake.

Or looking down on me.

I don’t know.

For whatever reason, he vacated that space.

Thanks to that, I easily cut into the open space and tore through Ternana’s defense.

- He’s fast! He’s fast! He’s fast!

- He’s already bypassed two players!

"You bastard!"

Suddenly, I heard a curse behind me.

Even in amateur soccer, I’ve seen people who cursed like that and then tackled from behind, breaking the back of manager Kang.

With that memory, I lightly twisted my body.

- Bruno Marcella’s tackle from behind! It was too dangerous! But the referee gives the advantage.

- He’s already penetrated the danger zone. He’s run 20 meters!

- One-on-one with the goalkeeper! It’s dangerous!

I tried to toy a bit.

But that damn guy fell too easily.

Now there’s only one player in front of me.

In this situation, the way to break the opponent’s spirit is, of course, nutmegging.

Nutmegging the goalkeeper.

As I quickly pushed the ball through the legs of the nervous goalkeeper, he fell in a strange pose.

"Ah!"

Seeing the dejected goalkeeper sitting down, I quickly ran to where our fans were.

Then I jumped and shouted while enlarging my eyes with both hands.

"If I’m a small-eyed monkey! You guys are big-eyed monsters! You bastards!"

Not understanding what I said, the Parma fans just kept shouting my name.

The score is now 4-1.

Just one more goal until the flares go off.

* * *

- The game is over!

- 6-2! Parma crushes Ternana with an overwhelming goal barrage!

- Today’s MVP is undoubtedly Mino Park, who made his professional debut!

- 2 goals and 2 assists! He led Parma’s attack and finished brilliantly with perfect performance.

It’s a pity.

When the score widened to 6-1.

Flares went off in the away section, but...

The police deployed to the stadium quickly stopped it, and the thick smoke and red flames soon disappeared.

Ironically, due to the flare smoke, we conceded a goal around the 44th minute of the second half, making the score 6-2.

Thus, my debut match ended.

[A player with an amazing story also has great skills? Mino's stunning debut for Parma Calcio!]

[Comments]

- Is this the player who said he was frustrated and wanted to play himself? No wonder he was frustrated.

- He really makes soccer look easy. Whenever Parma got stuck, he moved and unlocked the attack.

- They brought this guy for free... So good!

- He can play centrally instead of Franco, and he even played upfront in the friendlies! He has high tactical value.

With 2 goals and 2 assists.

Of course, the media was ablaze.

Until I left the field, Parma’s home fans didn’t leave the stadium and kept shouting ‘Mino.’

Moreover, it wasn’t just the reaction in the Parma region that was hot.

The response in Korea was also tremendous.

Even though there would be no broadcast for the 1st round of the Italian Cup.

If you ask how they knew about me...

I would like to tell you not to underestimate the illegal broadcasts of those who bet their lives on Toto.

[Community Comments]

- Park Minho is a god. He’s a warrior sent by the football god for Parma’s Serie A promotion and my Toto.

- Messi: I never sent such a warrior.

- Hey! You brat! How dare you, a dwarf, impersonate the football god?

- Stop bringing out your little brothers.

- There’s a player who said, ‘I’ll play if you’re frustrated’ and actually played and carried the team? Kaboom.

- ‘Ah... That’s not how you play soccer...’ <- Fact.

- Hahaha, so that’s not how you play soccer, huh? Hahaha.

- Thank you, Park Minho! Thanks to you, I have 200,000 won in my hand... I can eat chicken tomorrow.

And my first love in my first year of studying abroad, Monica, was the first to see my match and left a regretful message in our group chat.

- Monica: Mino. Do you like Arsenal by any chance?
