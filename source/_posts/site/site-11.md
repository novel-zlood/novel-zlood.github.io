## 4. Pro Debut (3)

The moment the equalizing goal was scored.

The players of Ternana felt drained.

They had expended their energy early in the game to score the first goal and had planned to calmly block Parma's attacking line, who were trailing 1-0, and then launch a counterattack in the second half.

However, with just one shot, all their plans went awry.

“Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!”

The 24-year-old late bloomer's debut goal was scored.

The home fans who filled Ennio Tardini, Parma's home stadium, continuously chanted the rookie's name.

- Amazing goal. He didn’t miss the small shooting angle allowed by the opponent.
- It's incredible. Are you saying this player didn't play football and did something else until he was 24? Truly astonishing.
- Now, Ternana needs to regroup and prepare for the second half. Having pushed hard in the first 20 minutes, they are bound to be physically outmatched by Parma.
- It's still a tie. If they hold on, opportunities will definitely come to Ternana.

“It’s okay! Stay focused!”

The coach of Ternana incessantly shouted.

The score was still 1-1.

There was definitely an opportunity for Ternana as well.

“Coach, I think we need to put David on that number 24 Asian player. Because of him, Parma's offensive is getting stronger.”

Reluctantly nodding at the assistant coach's advice, he shouted to David Gavazzi, Ternana's midfielder.

“David! Mark number 24!”

Whether he heard it clearly or not, David Gavazzi nodded and stuck to Park Minho.

(Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!)

(Son Crociati e tutti campioni!)

(Son del Parma i prodi calciatori!)

The home fans of Parma fervently sang their cheer songs.

In contrast to Parma, whose players were gaining momentum, the overall ability of the newly promoted Ternana team was lacking.

While Ternana's possession and pressure began to decrease, Parma started to completely dominate the game between the 30th and 40th minutes of the first half.

- Oh! Minho is doing so much for the team in the center. Who would see this player as a 24-year-old late bloomer playing his debut match?
- The ball flows back to the center!
- Minho has the ball! He's fast!

Losing momentum, Ternana could only resort to rough play to break the opponent's rhythm.

Although it could give the opponent a good chance if done wrong, it could also change the flow if they provoked the opponent a bit.

That's how desperate Ternana was.

As Park Minho, who passed the ball to Santiago running up the touchline, dug back into the center, Ternana's defense line wavered in confusion.

“Block the center!”

“Mark number 24! Mark number 24!”

The man-marking David Gavazzi momentarily stopped.

Because Park Minho, who was running forward, stopped.

Soon, Park Minho switched with central midfielder Juraj Kucka and retreated.

He hesitated momentarily.

Should he block Juraj Kucka, who was digging into the danger zone, or should he continue marking number 24?

That brief hesitation created a gap.

Thud!

A ball soared high.

Santiago's cross accurately connected with Gennaro Tutino's head in the center.

- Gennaro Tutinooooooo!
- Oh! Goalkeeper Titas Krapikas barely punches it away! He saves Ternana from a crisis!
- It's a corner kick situation. It's not safe yet.

In a normal situation, it would have been a goal.

Did the spirit of Yashin possess Ternana's goalkeeper?

A perfect chance was blocked.

“Aaah!”

Gennaro Tutino grabbed his head.

Thud, thud.

Park Minho moved to take the corner kick.

Gennaro Tutino, full of regret.

At that moment, he saw Park Minho raise three fingers and his eyes sparkled.

It was a signal to perform a short pattern play they had practiced during set-piece training.

Gennaro Tutino, who moved slightly outward, subtly moved behind the defender marking him.

The full-back, who could see him, didn't seem to care much.

Park Minho raised his hand high.

A beautifully curved corner kick flew towards Ternana's goalpost from his foot.

‘It's here!’

Gennaro was sure it was a goal.

He confidently brought his head to the ball dropping near him after turning behind the defender.

Because it was a sharply curving course, a situation arose where the defender's foot and his head were competing.

But he didn’t pull his head back.

Rather, he boldly pushed it forward.

Thwack!

Swoosh!

- Goooooooooal!
- Gennaro Tutino! Tutino scores with determination! It was a dangerous situation! But he ultimately put his head in!
- Although the defender's foot was slightly high, Gennaro Tutino was quite bold as well.

The torn uniform from the opponent's studs.

The red scratch visible through the torn uniform, but Gennaro Tutino didn't care.

“Waaaaaaaah!”

He ran like a bull towards the stands and raised his fists high in the air.

* * *

Halftime.

Having scored the go-ahead goal, Gennaro was changing his uniform and singing Parma's cheer song excitedly.

It was lucky he was in high spirits, but honestly, I was very surprised earlier.

It was a situation where he could have been seriously injured.

But Gennaro didn't care much.

When I asked him, Gennaro grinned.

“What? Wasn't it dangerous?”

“No, not at all. Sometimes, a man has to do what his heart tells him, even if it means facing a deadly risk.”

“Ha ha ha! The king of Parma! Gennaro is invincible!”

Fueled by adrenaline, he wandered around the locker room with an excited expression.

Coach Alain Levagne was muttering, ‘This is too dangerous. What if I become more famous than Klopp or Pep?’

Meanwhile, Giovanni Buffon, the team’s core, was struggling to organize the excited players.

However.

It seems our coach has a severe case of the "legendary manager syndrome" these days.

The good news is that he is competent.

If you have no ability and suffer from the legendary manager syndrome?

There's really no answer to that.

My father, who enjoys watching football, used to criticize Tottenham’s Nuno Espirito Santo, saying he had the legendary manager syndrome.

Anyway.

The flow of the first half was very good.

There were no special instructions.

He simply said, "Even if the opponent comes out rough, don't lose your composure. But don't get pushed around like a kid either."

It means to engage physically but avoid fouls.

After peeling a banana, I was contemplating how to handle the second half.

At that moment, Santiago came up to me and gave a thumbs-up.

“You were fantastic today! Minho.”

As expected.

Losing weight makes your mind stronger too.

Isn’t there a saying about this?

A healthy mind resides in a healthy body.

As I got fitter and my form returned, peace came to his face, which always used to look grumpy.

Is it possible that the Argentine sausage and this handsome South American guy are the same person?

It's really a mystery.

“Yeah, thanks.”

“You might see the flares from the opposing team today.”

Opposing team flares...

How many goals do we have to score to see that?

“Come on... To see that, we'd need at least a 4-goal difference, right? Moreover, if flares are set off, the fan who set them off gets a 3-year stadium ban, and the team supported by that fan also gets fined.”

Gianluca chimed in.

“I heard last time we were fined about 5,200 euros. Our passionate fans set off a flare during a friendly match.”

5,200 euros?

That's close to 7 million won.

“5,200 euros...”

Should I play really hard?

Create a 4-goal difference in the second half and make the flares go off in the away section.

Seeing my expression, Giovanni shook his head.

“Minho, let's play a normal game, please.”

* * *

Second half.

After halftime, Ternana aimed to score an equalizer during the chaotic time.

They attempted strong pressure like at the beginning of the first half.

They definitely had a good chance.

But they didn’t score.

Parma was not a naive team to fall for the same play shown by the opponent again.

After all, they were in Serie A last year.

At the same time, Ternana, who had pushed their lines up, was punished for their arrogance.

Thwack!

- Gooooooal!
- Juraj Kucka scores a long-range shot! The score is now 3-1!

A shot from quite a distance by Juraj flew sharply through the opponent's gap and shook the net.

Honestly, I thought it wouldn't work...

Ternana's defender momentarily lost focus and gave space.

Of course, Juraj Kucka didn’t miss that.

The away fans of Ternana were harshly criticizing their team with rough jeers.

Wasn't this given away too easily?

Honestly, I didn't expect it, but at this rate, the flares might really go off in the away section.

The score was now 3-1.

We became more relaxed.

On the other hand, Ternana was in a situation where they had to catch up with a 2-goal difference.

Ternana's players, unable to overcome their impatience, pressured us more roughly than before.

Whistle! Whistle!

“Ow!”

The moment I caught the ball, I tasted the grass.

Parma is really a grass heaven.

It's so bitter.

“That was a too dangerous contest. Be careful.”

“Sorry. And you, over there, sorry too.”

I lightly raised my hand at the apology from the opponent who committed the rough foul.

It was understandable.

Chasing a 2-goal difference in just 40 minutes was a difficult score to catch up with.

But this isn't right.

What’s the point of apologizing?

You tore my eye.

Santiago got angry on my behalf and confronted the guy who fouled me.

But the opponent just smirked and retreated.

“Are you okay?”

“Yeah, it didn't go in too deep.”

“I called him a monkey but didn’t tear his eye... That guy is really a bad seed.”

Oh, Santiago!

That's no different.

Seeing my sullen face, Santiago awkwardly scratched his head.

You punk.

At least you know you’re wrong.

I forgive your sins.

Anyway.

The game resumed.

Ternana's defenders committed rough fouls again against me and Santiago, the team's core players.

Seeing them restrain themselves against other players...

It seemed like they were targeting the aces.

This feels like a harsh debut match.

If not for the shin guards, one of my legs would have definitely broken.

But I didn't just stand there and take it.

I gave back as much as I received.

You tore my eye.

I'll enlarge your eyes.

This time, I moved a bit selfishly.

- Minho! He receives the ball and runs!
- David Gavazzi, who has been marking Minho, quickly approaches!

After passing the Italian mafia-looking brother who had been marking me, I dashed towards the defender who fouled me and tore my eye.

Are you letting your guard down now?

The guy gave me space in front.

Either by mistake.

Or because he underestimated me.

I don't know.

For whatever reason he left that space.

Thanks to that, I easily tore through Ternana's defense line while digging into the vacant space.

- Fast! Fast! Fast!
- He already passed two players!
 
“You son of a...!”

I heard a curse behind me.

Even in amateur football, there was a manager at Bangbangmulsan who used to tackle from behind and break Director Kang's back.

Because I had that memory, I lightly twisted my body.

- Bruno Maquela's back tackle! That was too dangerous! But the referee gives an advantage.
- He quickly penetrates the danger zone. Already ran 20 meters!
- One-on-one with the goalkeeper! It's dangerous!

I tried to toy with him a bit.

But that damn guy collapsed too easily.

Now, only one player was in front of me.

In such a situation, the best way to break the opponent's spirit is nutmegging.

Nutmegging the goalkeeper.

As I quickly poked the ball between the legs of the nervous goalkeeper, he collapsed in a strange pose.

“Ah!”

Seeing the goalkeeper sit down in despair, I quickly ran toward our fans.

Then I jumped and shouted while enlarging my eyes with both hands.

“If I'm a small-eyed monkey! You guys are big-eyed monsters! You damn bastards!”

Not understanding what I was saying, Parma fans just chanted my name.

The score was now 4-1.

Only one goal left until the flares go off.

* * *

- The game is over!
- 6-2! Parma sinks Ternana with an incredible goal explosion!
- Today's best player is definitely Minho Park, who made his professional debut!
- 2 goals and 2 assists! He led Parma's attack and even finished it off with a perfect performance.

What a shame.

When the score widened to 6-1.

The flares went off in the away section.

But the Parma regional police dispatched to the stadium quickly subdued it, and the thick smoke and red flames quickly disappeared.

Ironically, because of that flare smoke, we conceded a goal around the 44th minute of the second half, making the score 6-2.

Thus, my debut match ended.

[Comments]

- Is this the player who said he was frustrated so he would play himself? I can see why he was frustrated.
- He really makes football look easy. When Parma was blocked, he moved and opened up the attack.
- We got him for free… So good!
- He can play in the center instead of Franco, and he even played in the front line during friendly matches! His tactical value is quite high.

With 2 goals and 2 assists, it was a stellar performance.

Naturally, the media was all over it.

Until I left the field, Parma’s home fans didn’t leave the stadium and kept chanting ‘Minho.’

Moreover, the reaction wasn’t just hot in Parma.

The reaction in Korea was also amazing.

There wouldn’t have been a broadcast of the Italian Cup first-round match.

If you ask how they knew about me...

I want to say, don’t underestimate the illegal broadcasts of those who stake their lives on betting.

- Monica: Minho. Do you perhaps... like Arsenal?
