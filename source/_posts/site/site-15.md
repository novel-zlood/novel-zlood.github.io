## 6. National Team? Me? Why? (2)

The national team.

The players who represent a country.

Therefore, only those with exceptional skills can seize the honor of becoming national team members.

“But why me?”

This was something I couldn’t comprehend.

Suddenly, I'm called up to the national team?

Why am I, who is just starting to stand out in Serie B, called up to the national team?

I couldn't understand.

So I asked.

Why was I selected for the national team?

Then Leo answered me.

- South Korea secured their spot in the 2022 Qatar World Cup final qualifying round Group B, following the results of the last match.

- Moreover, Tottenham is somewhat negative about Shin Junseo’s call-up this time.

Well……. Senior Shin Junseo at Tottenham hasn’t had a break for two consecutive years.

Some people even said, ‘Shin Junseo might actually die from this!’ showing their concern.

- Because of that, most overseas players were not called up this time.

- Minho can be considered the fourth option among the secondary players……. With the first option, Shin Junseo, out and the other two players injured……. Also, more domestic players are injured than expected.

- So, in a way, it's a position you got by luck. Since you are a player in Serie B, it feels like they are just trying you out. They probably don’t have high expectations for you.

So.

It’s not an important match.

And due to the rotation and injuries of other players, the order has been pushed back to me.

No wonder I was suddenly called up to the national team.

I somewhat understood.

- South Korea essentially formed the national team with mostly second-tier players this time.

- Minho, you don’t need to feel too burdened. The first match is a friendly against Oman, and the second match is the ninth match of the final qualifiers against Uzbekistan.

Then I don’t need to feel too pressured.

I don’t know.

When I checked the sports news on my smartphone, the reactions weren’t entirely bad.

[Pedro Custodia, who called up Minho Park, an attacking midfielder from Serie B!]

[A dried-up pool of secondary players due to injuries. It's fortunate that we secured an early spot in the World Cup finals!]

[Coach Pedro: 'I will look at as many resources as possible. Especially keeping an eye on Minho Park.']

[A lineup primarily composed of domestic players! What kind of performance will they show against Oman?]

[Comments]

- Minho Park, isn't he that guy? The one who watched a Parma game, got frustrated, and went onto the field to score himself.

- That's right, lol.

- An ordinary student in Italy got called up to the South Korean national team? Boom!

- The storyline is killer. It looks like someone planned this story for a novel, lol.

- Both Junseok Lee and Yoohyuk Jeong are injured……. Can they really get their form back by the World Cup?

- Yeah, it's enough time. There's about 1 year and 2 months left, so they will definitely get back in form by then.

- He just debuted professionally a month ago… Is it okay to call him up to the national team?

- They probably called him up because his form was good during that one month?

- I think it's a bit much…

Fortunately, the reactions weren’t bad.

We already secured a spot in the World Cup finals.

They said it was an understandable choice since all the main secondary players were out due to rotation and injuries.

Of course, there were people questioning if it made sense to call up a player who just turned pro a month ago.

But my performance wasn’t that ambiguous.

More people said to just watch for now.

They had already called up everyone they could call for the national team.

They said it wouldn’t hurt to check me out.

So I boarded the plane.

And after arriving at Incheon Airport, I soon reached Paju NFC.

* * *

Pedro Custodia thought.

If the Qatar World Cup schedule had been delayed due to COVID-19, the beginning of the final qualifiers would have been quite tough.

Fortunately, COVID-19 subsided quickly.

The schedule remained unchanged.

In any case.

Maybe because the schedule wasn’t delayed, South Korea was placed in Group B for this Asian final qualifier.

Iran, China, Uzbekistan, UAE, Vietnam.

These were the five teams in the group.

Would it have been different if the schedule was delayed?

“How’s the preparation?”

“Good. The players' conditions are good, and they have blended into the tactics we prepared as we expected.”

Most of them are domestic players.

The overseas players are Juwon Kang from Girondins de Bordeaux.

Minjun Lee from Fenerbahçe.

Jooyong Kim from Rubin Kazan.

And finally, Minho Park from Parma Calcio.

Except for these four, all are domestic players.

Moreover, Minho Park is a player called to the national team for the first time, so the only players who can be called first-team are the other three excluding Minho Park.

So there was a bit of concern.

No matter how relaxed we are.

There was no reason to lose the remaining final qualifying matches.

The final qualifier matches for the World Cup are matches with quite high points counted towards FIFA ranking.

It was a chance to slightly raise South Korea’s FIFA ranking, which is in the mid-30s.

However.

Contrary to concerns, the form of the newly joined players was better than expected.

“They are in better form than I expected.”

“I used to think South Korea’s squad was weak without the first-team players……. But nowadays, it seems quite solid.”

“At least for the secondary players.”

The coaching staff, who followed Coach Pedro from Portugal to South Korea, watched the players with bright eyes.

The level of the domestic players was quite good.

Changmin Kim, Seungjae Baek, Juseon Moon.

The movements of the secondary players in the domestic league were better than expected.

“How about Sangbin Park?”

“Good. I think he is the third striker we can bring out after Juwon Kang and Joosung Lim.”

“I think so too. However, his style overlaps with Shin Junseo, so depending on the situation, it may not be easy to deploy him.”

Coach Pedro nodded.

He turned his head and looked at a man who seemed somewhat isolated among the national team.

“How about Minho?”

“Minho…… Honestly, I don’t know.”

“You don’t know?”

“He is definitely a good player……. He reminds me of Özil during his Arsenal days.”

“If we use him in the center, other players will need to sacrifice.”

“I think the same. If we use him on the left, there won’t be a problem.”

“Do you have any data?”

“Yes, he played on the left in the recent Serie B matches and showed quite an active performance. But he was mostly substituted after 60 minutes, so there seems to be a stamina issue.”

He is a player like a double-edged sword.

It doesn’t mean Minho Park is lacking.

His style overlaps.

Or he just doesn’t fit the team’s tactics.

There was no need to forcefully use him.

Certainly, Seungjae Baek, a central midfielder, could be used as a secondary player in an emergency.

Sangho Kang could also play in the secondary central position.

However, there was one thing that bothered him.

“Has that guy ever played as a striker?”

“No, he hasn’t. He mostly played in the secondary position.”

Coach Pedro stared at Minho Park for a while and then nodded.

“Let’s try putting that guy in the next practice match with Juwon Kang as a pair of strikers.”

His instinct told him.

That player seems like he could do well as a striker.

There was no evidence.

It was just a hunch.

But Coach Pedro was sure that hunch would fit well.

* * *

It’s awkward.

I don’t know anyone.

I felt even more isolated because Shin Junseo, the captain of the national team and my senior by one year in high school, wasn’t here.

Thankfully, it wasn’t a hostile atmosphere.

Just…… a bit awkward.

But senior Juwon Kang, who was assigned to the same room, took care of me more than I expected, so the atmosphere wasn’t entirely awkward.

After the lunch training, senior Juwon Kang took me around and introduced me to the national team players.

Thanks to him, I was able to chat with other players.

They were amazed by my story.

“Wow……. That’s an amazing story.”

“It reminds me of what senior Ki Sangyong said back in the day.”

“Oh! If you’re frustrated, you should play yourself?”

“So we have someone who actually did that here. Haha! It’s really amazing.”

Anyway.

As I got more accustomed, I started noticing my surroundings.

It seemed like I was a double-edged sword to them.

Due to my low activity level, I didn’t fit Coach Pedro’s tactics, which required high activity in the secondary central position.

And moving to the wing wasn’t an option since the secondary wing positions were already saturated.

I gave up my expectations.

I was called to the national team as a stopgap anyway.

What more could I expect?

However.

The next day, during the practice match, Coach Pedro directed me to play as the frontline striker.

“What? Me? As a striker?”

“Yes, Minho! I think you have enough talent to play as a striker.”

If the coach says so……. I will play, but.

Honestly, I don’t know if I have the physical strength to endure between tough defenders.

I don’t have an entirely lacking physical build, but I have never played in the striker position.

“It’s okay. I won’t place you as the lone striker. You will play as a pair with Juwon Kang.”

Since the coach directed so.

I had no choice but to follow his words.

But…….

Does a striker just need to score goals?

I have never played in the frontline position.

So I asked senior Juwon Kang.

“What type of striker do you find comfortable to play with? Hmm……. Probably a player like Benzema would be the best?”

“Benzema?”

“Yeah, I'm not that great at post-play. So, it’s more comfortable to have a striker who can connect and do post-play while playing as a pair with me.”

Karim Benzema.

I know he played for Real Madrid.

He still plays there.

Although overshadowed by a player named Ronaldo, I know he is an excellent striker.

“He’s a complete striker with world-class post-play abilities. Honestly, if it weren’t for all the controversies, he would be rated even higher.”

Is he that good?

I wanted to watch Benzema’s videos.

So, before the practice match, I briefly checked out Benzema’s videos on my smartphone.

“Wow……. He is indeed different.”

Sorry to Gianluca and Gennaro.

But the level of talent was on another plane.

I could see why such a player continues to play for a team like Real Madrid despite countless controversies and still gets called up to the French national team.

“His skills are truly respectable.”

The talent was different.

Such a connecting player also scores quite well?

Isn’t he the perfect striker?

“Minho! Come quickly!”

“Yes!”

Thinking about Benzema’s play that I briefly saw, I entered the practice match.

Both A team and B team used a 4-4-2 formation.

Coach Pedro’s main formation was 4-2-3-1, but this time, since all the main players for that tactic were out, it seemed like he was testing a different tactic.

I was paired with senior Juwon Kang as the B team’s striker.

Before the practice started.

Coach Pedro told me to ‘not worry about stamina and move as much as possible.’

It seemed like I would be placed as a 1.5-line striker rather than a full secondary resource in the national team.

*Whistle sound*

And.

While lost in various thoughts.

The practice match began.

* * *

What is the most important factor for a striker?

Well, everyone knows it’s ‘goals.’

If a player scores goals, no one cares if he’s a turtle or Charlie Adam, and they’ll put him at the frontline.

In that sense, am I a good striker?

I don’t know yet.

If I knew that after playing for the first time today, I’d be a football god.

Right?

In that sense, am I doing well now?

At least, the expression on senior Juwon Kang’s face wasn’t bad, so I think I can give myself a passing grade.

Moreover, it was quite fun to play while holding the ball with my back.

Was it because I adapted well?

My B team already had 4 effective shots.

“Let’s focus a bit more!”

“Align the line! Align!”

Senior Juwon Kang’s excellent off-the-ball and line-breaking abilities seemed to keep the A team’s defense busy.

Moreover, I realized something surprising.

I’m actually quite good at physical battles.

Honestly, I was worried because I had never properly engaged in physical battles while playing in the secondary central position.

But I held up better than I thought.

My body was sturdier than I anticipated.

Senior Juwon Kang even praised my sense of balance.

The ball came to me again.

This time, I pushed away the defending player while receiving the ball and deeply penetrated the A team’s danger area.

Then I made a clean through pass to senior Juwon Kang, who was breaking the line.

Naturally, senior Juwon Kang finished it with a non-stop shot.

*Thud*

“Nice!”

Finally, the first goal was scored.

Senior Juwon Kang gave me a thumbs up.

It was fascinating.

So, this is another way to play football.

I realized something new.

At the same time.

I experimented with everything I could.

Since it’s a practice match.

Of course, I made a lot of mistakes.

But despite my mistakes, Coach Pedro’s expression while watching the game seemed particularly bright.

“Good movement! Move more aggressively! Minho!”

Even when I failed in dribbling, he smiled with satisfaction and praised me to move more actively.

Thanks to that, I could move with confidence.

Eventually, the first half of the practice match ended.

2 assists.

I didn’t score, but.

I achieved somewhat satisfactory results.

Unfortunately, I was substituted in the second half.

But I felt like I made a good impression on Coach Pedro.

“Minho! You will start in the upcoming friendly against Oman.”

But, he seemed too pleased.

Is this what they call favoritism?

Suddenly, a starter?

“A starter?”

“Yes, and you will also start in the match against Uzbekistan after that, so be prepared.”

Moreover, I will start in the 9th match of the World Cup final qualifiers?

Something.

Something felt very strange.

No, why am I a starter?

I couldn’t understand.

“Me? Why?”

Coach Pedro just smiled broadly and gave me a thumbs up.
