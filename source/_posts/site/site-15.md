## 6. National Team? Me? Why? (2)

National Team.

Players who represent a country.

Therefore, only those with exceptional skills can achieve the honor of being part of the national team.

“But why me?”

I couldn't understand this.

Suddenly, the national team?

Why would I, who is just now standing out in Serie B, be called up to the national team?

I couldn't understand.

So I asked.

Why was I called up to the national team?

Leo answered me.

- In the final qualifiers of Group B for the 2022 Qatar World Cup, South Korea has secured its place in the World Cup based on the previous match results.

- Additionally, Tottenham is somewhat negative about Shin Junseo's call-up this time.

Well... Shin Junseo, who plays for Tottenham, hadn't had a proper rest for two consecutive years.

Some people even worried, saying, “At this rate, Shin Junseo might really die!”

- Because of that, most of the overseas-based players were not called up this time.

- Mino can be considered the fourth option among the second line resources. With the first option Shin Junseo out, and the other two players out due to injuries... Moreover, there are more injured players among the domestic players than expected.

- In a way, it's a position gained by luck. Since you're a player in Serie B, they probably decided to give you a chance. They probably don't have high expectations for you, Mino.

So.

It's not an important match.

It means that due to the distribution of stamina and injuries of other players, my turn came up.

No wonder they suddenly called me up to the national team.

I somewhat understood.

- South Korea has mostly formed the national team with second-tier players this time.

- Mino, there's no need to feel a huge burden. The first match is a friendly against Oman, and the second match is the ninth match of the final qualifiers against Uzbekistan.

Then, I guess there's no need to feel a huge burden.

I'm not sure.

When I checked the sports articles on my smartphone, the reactions weren't entirely bad.

[Coach Pedro Custodia calls up attacking midfielder Park Minho from Serie B!]

[Second line resources dry up due to injuries. It's fortunate they secured their spot in the World Cup early!]

[Coach Pedro: ‘I will evaluate as many resources as possible. Especially keeping an eye on Park Minho.’]

[Line-up mostly composed of domestic players! What kind of performance will they show against Oman?]

[Comments]

- Park Minho, right? That guy... He watched the Parma game and got so frustrated that he stepped onto the field himself and scored a goal.

- Correct, LOL

- An ordinary student in Italy gets called up to the South Korean national team? Boom!

- This story is killer. Looks like someone scripted it for a novel later, LOL

- Lee Junseok is injured, and Jung Yuhyuk is injured too... Can they get back in form by the World Cup?

- Yeah, definitely. There's still about 1 year and 2 months left, they will surely get back in form by then.

- He only debuted in the pros a month ago... Is it okay to call him up to the national team?

- He must have shown good form during that month, that's why they called him up.

- I think it's a bit much...

Fortunately, the reactions weren't bad.

They've already secured their spot in the World Cup.

And since all the main second line players were out due to stamina distribution and injuries, they said it was an understandable choice.

Of course, some people questioned if it made sense for a player who just turned pro a month ago to be called up to the national team.

But my performance wasn't that ambiguous.

More people suggested to wait and see.

After all, they've called up everyone else who could be called up.

So they said it wouldn't be bad to take a look at me.

I boarded the plane.

Upon arriving at Incheon Airport, I could soon reach Paju NFC.

* * *

Pedro Custodia thought.

If the schedule for the Qatar World Cup had been delayed due to COVID-19, the early part of these final qualifiers would have been quite tough.

Fortunately, COVID-19 subsided quickly.

The schedule remained unchanged.

Anyway.

Maybe because the schedule wasn't delayed, South Korea was placed in Group B in this final Asian qualifier.

Iran, China, Uzbekistan, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam.

They were grouped with the five teams above.

If the schedule had been delayed, it might have been different?

“How is the preparation?”

“Good. The players are in good shape. They have adapted well to the tactics we prepared.”

Most of the players were domestic.

The overseas players included Gang Juwon from Girondins Bordeaux.

Min Jun from Fenerbahçe.

Kim Juyong from Rubin Kazan.

And lastly, Park Minho from Parma Calcio.

Excluding these four, all were domestic players.

Moreover, Park Minho was called up to the national team for the first time, so in a way, only the other three could be considered first-tier players.

So there was some worry.

Even if there's leeway.

There was no need to lose the remaining final qualifying matches.

The World Cup final qualifiers were high-stakes matches that contributed significantly to FIFA rankings.

It was an opportunity to slightly improve South Korea's mid-30s FIFA ranking.

However.

Contrary to concerns, the form of the newly joined players was better than expected.

“They are definitely in better form than I expected.”

“Two years ago, I thought South Korea's squad was weak without the first-tier players... But these days, it seems quite solid.”

“At least the second line resources seem so.”

The coaching staff who followed Coach Pedro from Portugal to South Korea watched the players with bright eyes.

The level of the domestic players was quite impressive.

Kim Changmin, Baek Seungjae, Moon Jusun.

The movements of the second-line resources playing in the domestic league were better than expected.

“How's Park Sangbin?”

“Good. I think he’s the third striker the team can use after Gang Juwon and Lim Jusung.”

“I think so too. But since his style overlaps with Shin Junseo, it might not be easy to use him depending on the situation.”

Coach Pedro nodded.

He turned his head to look at a man who seemed isolated among the national team players.

“What about Mino?”

“Mino... Honestly, I'm not sure.”

“Not sure?”

“He's certainly a good player... But he reminds me a lot of Özil during his Arsenal days.”

“To use him centrally, I think it would require sacrifices from other players.”

“I think the same. If we use him on the left, there shouldn't be any problem.”

“Do we have any data?”

“Yes, in the recent Serie B matches, he played on the left and showed quite an active performance. But most of the time, he was substituted out after 60 minutes, so there seem to be stamina issues.”

He's a bit like a white elephant.

It doesn't mean Park Minho is lacking.

It's just that his style overlaps.

Or he doesn't fit into the tactics of the national team.

So there was no need to force him into the lineup.

Clearly, central midfielder Baek Seungjae could be used as a makeshift in the second line.

Kang Sangho could also play centrally in the second line.

However, there was one thing that bothered him.

“Has he ever played as a forward?”

“I don’t think so. He mostly played in the second line.”

Coach Pedro stared at Park Minho for a moment and then nodded.

“Let's try him as a forward with Gang Juwon in the next practice match.”

His intuition told him.

This player would do well as a striker.

There was no basis.

It was just a feeling.

But Coach Pedro was sure this intuition would hit the mark.

* * *

It's awkward.

I don't know anyone.

Without Shin Junseo, the team captain and my senior by one year in high school, I felt even more isolated.

Thankfully, it wasn't an atmosphere of ostracism.

Just... a bit awkward.

But fortunately, senior Gang Juwon, who was assigned to the same room, took care of me more than I expected, so the awkward atmosphere didn't last too long.

After the afternoon training, senior Gang Juwon took me around and introduced me to the national team players.

Thanks to him, I could also talk with other players.

They were amazed by my story.

“Wow... your story is really something.”

“It reminds me of what senior Gi Sangyong once said.”

“Ah! If you're frustrated, why don't you play yourself?”

“That's exactly what this guy did. Seriously impressive, right?”

Anyway.

As I adapted, I could see my surroundings more clearly.

I seemed like a white elephant.

I didn’t have the stamina to fit into Coach Pedro's tactics, which required a lot of activity in the central second line.

And moving to the sides wasn't an option because the second-line side resources were already overflowing.

I had already given up expectations.

I was called up to the national team as a stopgap anyway.

What more could I expect?

However.

The next day, during practice, Coach Pedro instructed me to play as the frontline striker.

“What? Me? As a striker?”

“Yes, I think, Mino! You have enough talent to play as a striker.”

Since the coach said so... I would play, but.

Honestly, I wasn't sure if I had the physicality to withstand the rough defenders.

I don't have a completely lacking physicality, but... shouldn't you have played as a striker before?

“It's okay. I won't put you as a lone striker. You'll play as a duo with Gang Juwon.”

Since the coach instructed so.

I had no choice but to comply.

But... 

Does a striker just need to score goals?

Shouldn't you have experience playing at the frontline?

So I asked senior Gang Juwon.

“What type of striker do you find it easy to work with? Hmm... A player like Benzema would be good, I guess?”

“Benzema?”

“Yeah, I'm not that good at post play. It would be much easier to have a striker who can link up with me and do post play in a duo.”

Karim Benzema.

I know he played for Real Madrid.

He still plays there.

Even though he was overshadowed by a player named Ronaldo, I knew he was an excellent striker.

“He's a complete striker with world-class post-play ability. Honestly, if it weren't for all the controversies, he'd be rated even higher than he is now.”

Is he that good?

I felt like watching Benzema's videos.

So before the practice match, I quickly checked out Benzema's videos on my smartphone.

“Wow... He's definitely different.”

I felt sorry for Gianluca and Gennaro.

But a different level of talent was unfolding before my eyes.

I understood why such a player continued to play for Real Madrid despite all the controversies and got called up to the French national team.

“His skill alone is truly respectable.”

The talent was different.

And this kind of linking player scores quite well too?

Isn't he the closest to a complete striker?

“Minho! Hurry up!”

“Yes!”

Thinking about Benzema’s play that I quickly watched, I entered the practice match.

Both A team and B team used a 4-4-2 formation.

Coach Pedro’s main formation was 4-2-3-1, but since all the main players for that formation were out, it seemed like he was testing another tactic.

I was paired with senior Gang Juwon as the forward for the B team.

Before starting the practice.

Coach Pedro told me to ‘Move as much as possible without worrying about stamina.’

It seemed likely that I would be placed as a 1.5 line striker rather than a full second line resource in the national team.

*whistle*

And.

While I was lost in various thoughts.

The practice match began.

* * *

What is the most important element for a striker?

Well, as everyone knows, it's ‘goals’.

If a player scores goals, no one cares if he's a turtle or Charlie Adam; they would plant him in the frontline.

From that perspective, am I a good striker?

I wouldn't know yet since it's my first time playing as one today.

If I knew that, I would be a football god.

Wouldn't you agree?

From that perspective, am I doing well now?

Judging by the expression of my strike partner, senior Gang Juwon, I think I can give myself a passing grade.

More than that, playing with my back to the goal and holding the ball was quite fun.

Was it because I adapted well?

The B team I was in had already recorded four shots on target.

“Let's focus a bit more!”

“Align the line! The line!”

Maybe because of the excellent off-the-ball and line-breaking skills of senior Gang Juwon, the A team's defenders seemed busy.

More than that, I realized something surprising.

I am quite good at physical battles.

Honestly, I was worried a lot as I had never really engaged in proper physical battles while playing centrally in the second line.

But I held up better than expected.

My body was sturdier than I anticipated.

Especially my balance, which senior Gang Juwon praised.

The ball came to me again.

Once again, I received the ball and pushed away the defender who came at me, digging deeply into the A team's danger zone.

And I connected a clean through pass to senior Gang Juwon, who was making a line-breaking move.

Of course, it was finished with senior Gang Juwon's non-stop shot.

*thud*

“Nice!”

Finally, the first goal was scored.

Senior Gang Juwon gave me a thumbs up after scoring.

It was amazing.

So you can play football like this too.

I realized something new.

At the same time.

I experimented with everything I could.

After all, it was a practice match.

Naturally, there were a lot of mistakes.

But despite my mistakes, Coach Pedro's expression seemed particularly bright as he watched the game.

“Good movement! Move more aggressively! Mino!”

Even when I failed in dribbling, he smiled contentedly and praised me to move more actively.

Thanks to that, I could move with confidence.

Soon, the first half of the practice match ended.

Two assists.

I didn’t score, but.

I achieved somewhat satisfactory results.

Unfortunately, I was substituted in the second half.

But it felt like I had made a strong impression on Coach Pedro.

“Mino! You will start in the friendly against Oman.”

But, he seemed too pleased?

Is this what they call favoritism?

Suddenly a starter?

“A starter?”

“Yes, and you will also start in the match against Uzbekistan after that, so be prepared.”

Moreover, a starter in the 9th match of the final World Cup qualifier too?

Something.

Something felt very strange.

Why am I suddenly a starter?

I couldn’t understand.

“Me? Why?”

Coach Pedro just smiled and gave me a thumbs up in response to my question.
