## 33. Display of Skills (1)

[The End of Haaland's Transfer Saga?]

[Liverpool? PSG? Real Madrid? Which team can match the weekly salary Haaland's agent Mino Raiola demands?]

[Haaland spotted in Spain!]

[Haaland, “Just visiting Madrid.”]

[Raiola, “The best players deserve the best treatment. Haaland is undoubtedly one of the best.”]

The chaotic rumors surrounding Haaland's transfer were ongoing.

The closest transfer to Manchester United was quieted with the signings of Derrick de Jong and Shin Junseo.

As a result, the rumors linking Haaland with Liverpool, which agitated Manchester United, naturally subsided.

Of course, the greedy Raiola wasn't one to sit still.

He continued to stir up various clubs with rumors about Haaland, raising his market value.

When the criticism aimed at Raiola from the media reached its peak, a somewhat settled story emerged.

[Haaland spotted in Paris!]

[Haaland to play alongside Messi and Neymar!]

[PSG secures Haaland!]

In the end, Haaland transferred to Paris Saint-Germain.

Despite receiving love calls from big clubs in various leagues, his final decision was France.

Real Madrid, who were targeting Haaland, and Manchester City were left disappointed.

Ultimately, Manchester City missed out on both Park Minho and Haaland.

However, Manchester City shifted their focus.

There was still one forward in Parma who looked very tempting to them.

[Manchester City shows great interest in Parma's main striker, Kenneth Marsetico!]

[Kenneth is Parma's top scorer, excluding Mino!]

[Big clubs show great interest in Kenneth, who scored 33 goals in the league last season!]

Moreover, Kenneth was a traditional striker, making him very attractive to Manchester City, who hadn't found a striker as good as Aguero since.

[Kenneth, “I've already renewed my contract. I won't be leaving the team this season.”]

Of course, Kenneth had no intention of leaving Parma.

He was satisfied with Parma.

As the stormy transfer market was settling down, Alain Levagne was finally able to report to Arsenal's training ground.

With a happy expression, he nodded as he looked at the newly joined players.

"Perfect."

If he could lift the championship trophy with Arsenal, he would truly become a world-renowned manager.

"Alain Levagne became a world-renowned manager by lifting the championship trophies with both Parma and Arsenal."

"Good... Very good. This is a fitting sentence for the last line of my autobiography."

He nodded with a bright smile.

Meanwhile, his assistant coach Mateo, who followed him to Arsenal, sighed deeply and shook his head.

Despite coming to Arsenal, Alain's arrogance as a top manager still hadn't changed.

---

He's an intriguing player.

A Japanese player well-known even in our country.

Arsenal's right-back, Takehiro Kamiyasu, initially looked at me with a wary gaze.

Then, after seeing me warming up on the training ground, he seemed somewhat satisfied.

When he saw me approach Lorenzo Lupo without hesitation, he even showed a strange delight.

"You're different!"

When I heard that, I couldn't understand what kind of team Arsenal was that a model student-like person would say such a thing.

I wondered if it was a team like Manchester United, where everyone was busy dancing and having fun, but luckily, the players showed up on time for training.

There weren't many who were late.

So why did that Japanese guy say that?

I realized why during the actual training.

He's extremely shy and quiet.

In a good sense, it means he's quiet and dedicated to training, but in football, where explosive performance is necessary, it didn't seem like a fitting personality.

Even the model student-like Kamiyasu spoke more during training.

Of course, not everyone was like that.

Axel Odegaard, Bernard Paty, and Tyler Smith Rowe were genuinely trying to lift the team's spirits with their energy.

Sure, not everyone needs to be full of fighting spirit.

As we rack up victories, the atmosphere will naturally improve.

But this issue is quite significant.

Yes, this team has factions.

There can't be a lack of factions.

Even in Parma, there were factions.

The problem was that these factions in Arsenal felt scattered like grains of sand rather than united.

According to what Marlon Ramsdale, who was thoroughly beaten by me in the Europa League quarterfinals, said, the first faction was the veterans centered around captain Tyrone Tierney.

They weren't a big problem.

In fact, they were diligent and dedicated to training.

I watched during training, and the veteran group positively approached the new players.

Talking with them made me feel that Arsenal wasn't such a bad team.

The second faction was the South American group centered around Pedro Ocampos.

They were the only group with habitual latecomers, a small group of South American players.

Communication was difficult since they couldn't speak English, but at least Ricardo Magalhaes, a Brazilian from the veteran group, facilitated communication to some extent.

The problem was that it was just communication.

They didn't easily unite as a team.

This certainly seemed like a significant issue for the future.

The last group was composed of young players, essentially a group of troublemakers.

A small group of players aged 19 to 21.

Amani Richards, Miles Viteres, Maximiliano Robledo, and so on.

These were the biggest problems.

It felt like watching a version of Manchester United's Pogba and some young players but in Arsenal's context?

They were really energetic.

Dancing enthusiastically was fine.

But even during training, they couldn't hide their excitement.

Of course, enjoying training is a good sign.

But they shouldn't cross the line.

These kids often disrupted the atmosphere during training.

Captain Tyrone Tierney managed to coordinate and create some order, but it was challenging for him to handle it all alone.

It was honestly a mess.

To be precise, it felt scattered like grains of sand.

Kamiyasu said that if our coach Alain hadn't cut eight players upon his arrival, the atmosphere would have been even worse.

It's already a mess... and it could have been worse?

Coach Kike Arteta...

What kind of battle were you fighting?

Anyway.

The atmosphere wasn't great.

But it wasn't terrible either.

Honestly, I thought some significant faction fights were waiting for me, but what awaited me instead were these energetic youngsters' pranks.

So why does the coach smile at me?

And why am I being called as the first interviewee?

I had a chilling feeling down my spine.

After the interview.

Coach Alain had a satisfied smile.

As expected, Park Minho was the cheat key.

He asked Park Minho, the first interviewee, to mentor the young players.

Park Minho's reputation, having conquered Serie A, would resonate well with the young players.

Of course, Park Minho's expression turned sour.

Anyway.

Remembering Arsenal struggling in the relegation zone in the first half of last season, Coach Alain nodded.

The squad and team atmosphere were better than expected.

Marlon Ramsdale, Tyrone Tierney, Takehiro Kamiyasu, Axel Odegaard, and others.

Most of the players were entering their prime, and the newly signed players were showing their potential.

The problem was the team atmosphere.

Even in Parma, there were factions.

Those factions didn't unite to lead the team to victory.

Factions always acted separately.

This couldn't be changed.

But at least in Parma, there was a minimal level of communication and respect for each other's cultures and thoughts.

So what about Arsenal?

"It's a mess."

The veteran group found the young troublemakers' habit of playing music on speakers and dancing during training unacceptable.

They conveyed their opinion, "This shouldn't happen in a prestigious club like Arsenal!" to Coach Alain during the interview.

The young troublemakers also had issues.

They considered the veterans as "old-fashioned."

Though the veterans' skills were genuine, their experiences didn't always apply, so the young players felt no need to listen.

Sometimes, the young players' creative moves saved the team from crises, making them distrust the veterans' experiences even more.

Lastly, the South American group had no intention of even talking to the other two factions.

They had no intent to compromise their cultural or lifestyle habits from South America.

They were the very definition of "mercenaries."

"It's really a mess."

Coach Alain couldn't help but admire Coach Kike Arteta for leading the team and securing even one win in the first half of the season amidst such a tough atmosphere.

He also had to acknowledge the abilities of interim coach Theo Mertesacker, who managed to lead the team to fifth place in the league despite such an atmosphere.

Changing this atmosphere would take considerable time.

This was an unchangeable fact.

But Coach Alain knew a quicker way to change the atmosphere.

"A damn amazing superstar."

A harsh word slipped from his mouth.

But Coach Alain was confident.

If a superstar with exceptional skills was in the team, the team would naturally unite around them.

In Parma, that was Park Minho.

Of course, some would inevitably feel jealous of such a superstar.

But Coach Alain was willing to decisively cut such players during the winter.

"It's common sense to quickly get rid of the black sheep."

That's why he entrusted the young group to Park Minho.

Surely, there would be some among the young players who would become jealous of Park Minho's skills.

While transfers were still possible.

Coach Alain planned to loan out those players.

"Good. Very good."

As expected, Park Minho was the cheat key.

With a satisfied expression, Coach Alain smiled and nodded, envisioning Arsenal's future.

It was the worst interview.

Oh, of course, the coach's interview was excellent.

The content was the problem.

How much effort did I put into managing the slackers in Parma?

And now, I had to play nanny at Arsenal too.

How frustrating is that?

But what could I do?

When the coach gives an order, I have to follow.

So, I tried to talk to the young ones as much as possible.

Honestly, there's only a five-year age gap, so there shouldn't be much of a generation gap.

"Hey... Minho! You don't know this?"

"It's the club dance that's trending these days!"

"Wow! You seem so old."

"Hachikitachi!"

"Don't you know the trending TikTok songs?"

I take that back.

No, what kind of difference does five years make...

They say things I can't understand.

It's not that my English is lacking.

I studied it as hard as Italian.

But the constant new slang and incomprehensible topics confused my mind.

If conversations aren't working...

Then I'll have to use another method.

Yes, the best way I bonded with young players in my second season at Parma.

"A demonstration of skills."

Whether young or old, a football player with good skills is the ace and the leader.

Fortunately, I have a good opponent.

The first friendly match against Celtic.

I need to show some flashy plays in this game.

London kids.

Wait a bit.

I'll show you the true skills of the god from Parma!
