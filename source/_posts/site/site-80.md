## 29. Arsenal! Did you wait long? (3)

Jade Kroenke.

As the eldest son of Arsenal's owner, Stan Kroenke, he began to make significant investments in the team, unlike his father who had less interest in football. This earned him much praise from the Arsenal fans.

Unlike his father, who caused a mess with the Super League creation and invested little in the club, Jade Kroenke consistently invested in the team, earning a reputation as a more reliable figure among Arsenal fans.

In fact, the comparison to Stan Kroenke is almost unfair, as many Arsenal fans have nothing but harsh words for Stan Kroenke.

Although some transfers failed, Jade Kroenke showed much more affection for the club by investing actively, unlike his father.

Today, Jade Kroenke, seated in the VIP section to watch the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final, focused expectantly on a particular player from Parma.

"That player is Minho..."

It was mesmerizing.

The defense, brought in at the request of former manager Mikel Arteta, was getting penetrated instantly.

-Minho! Quickly breaking through and crossing!

-Kenneth's header!

-Marlon Ramsdale! A fantastic save!

-Arsenal's guardian angel saves the team from danger multiple times today!

The match was tight.

Arsenal had the overall upper hand in ability.

However, the team that controlled the flow of the game was not Arsenal but Parma.

At the center of this was Park Minho.

Jade Kroenke, aware of this, was eager to see that player in an Arsenal jersey.

The problem was money.

Unlike his father, Jade Kroenke was willing to invest a lot in Arsenal.

However, competing against other clubs with even more financial power, especially those backed by oil money, was the issue.

Could they compete and bring that fantastic player to Arsenal?

It would be tough.

But seeing him play made Jade Kroenke determined to bring him at any cost.

-Minho receives the pass from Filippo Asnelli and shoots with finesse!

-Minho! Goooooal!

-Gooooal! It's in! Minho! Parma leads 2-1 at Emirates Stadium!

By any means necessary, he had to bring him.

Jade Kroenke made up his mind.

Europa League quarter-final, first leg.

Korean fans eagerly awaited this match.

A mini Korea-Japan match, the stage of the Europa League quarter-finals, and the position of Parma aiming for a mini-treble.

It was a setup bound to create buzz.

Especially in Korea.

The first leg between Arsenal and Parma ended in a 2-2 draw, making Korean fans look forward to the second leg.

[Park Minho's brace leads to a 2-2 draw!]
[The team advancing to the Europa League semi-finals will be decided at Parma's home!]
[Lorenzo Lupo vs. Park Minho! The first leg ends in a draw!]

The team advancing to the Europa League semi-finals would be determined by the second leg's result.

Naturally, fan expectations were high.

-Wow... Europa League is different indeed.
-Getting a draw away from home means it's doable.
-Let's go, Parma!
-Arsenal is a good team, but... their cohesion seemed off. The reason they did well in the first leg was thanks to Marlon Ramsdale's fantastic saves.
-Pedro Ocampos and Bernard Partey's coordination wasn't great either.
-I think Parma has a good chance. Watching yesterday's game gave me confidence in the squad.
-Minhooo!

The Europa League quarter-final first leg at Emirates Stadium saw Arsenal's fierce momentum from the start.

However, they couldn't maintain it until the end and eventually allowed a counter-attack from Parma.

Especially, Arsenal's backline, centered around Daniel Saliba and Ricardo Maga, easily allowed Park Minho to create many good chances.

If Marlon Ramsdale hadn't made some godly saves to stop Park Minho's shots, Arsenal would have faced the second leg with a loss instead of a draw.

Overall, Arsenal had a slight edge in performance, but the flow of the game was controlled by Parma.

After the match, Arsenal fans expressed their disappointment with the team's performance on various social media platforms.

Most of the criticism was directed at the underperforming midfielders.

Despite this, the draw wasn't a bad result, so Arsenal fans began to look forward to a win in the second leg.

-Even though it's an away game, Arsenal is a team with strong potential. Especially if Ramsdale and Lorenzo are in good condition... they can get a good result in the second leg.
-The midfielders will perform better in the second leg.
-Go! Go! Arsenal!

However,

There were some who mocked Arsenal.

-They haven't faced Parma at home yet, that's why they're so confident?
-It's quite audacious to think they can beat the invincible Parma at home.
-Serie A victims haven't even managed a proper draw at Parma's home yet... What? Arsenal to win at Parma? Laughable...

Fans of Serie A teams that had faced Parma mocked Arsenal.

And April 13th, the date of the second leg, was approaching quickly.

* * *

The game against Sampdoria ended.

The result was a 5-2 victory for Parma.

Despite some main players, including me, being rested in preparation for the Europa League quarter-final against Arsenal, we secured an easy win against bottom-placed Sampdoria.

Thanks to this, Parma's points tally reached 79.

The gap widened to 17 points ahead of second-placed Juventus.

With 8 league games remaining, winning at least 3 more matches would secure the Serie A title for Parma.

Thus, our coach started to focus more on the Europa League, as the league was almost in the bag.

“Arsenal's midfield is definitely fierce. The reason we dominated the attack in the first leg was partly because their midfielders weren't in good form.”

The screen our coach showed displayed Arsenal players passing the ball quickly, breaking down the opposing defense with their signature play.

And the final pass leading to Lorenzo Lupo's goal was a 'beautiful play' fitting for Arsenal.

However,

If they showed this fantastic form consistently, Arsenal would have been the top team in the league.

But they couldn't, and that's why they struggled in the relegation zone early in the season and barely climbed to 5th place.

Our coach continued to explain how we should approach the second leg.

In training, we practiced different patterns based on the feedback to prepare for the second leg, and that lazy guy was unusually energetic on the field.

I heard he bought a new drone recently; maybe he's excited to play with it.

After training, I returned home, where Monica quickly ran to greet me.

"Whose jersey do you want?"

At my question, Monica blushed and whispered shyly, "That... Ramsdale's... jersey..."

After the first leg, I exchanged jerseys with Lorenzo and brought it to Monica, who treated me like a god, much to my surprise.

Anyway,

I kissed Monica's cheek as she looked at me with hopeful eyes.

Since my Monica wanted it... I had to get it for her.

Monica looked at me expectantly.

Knowing how much of a passionate Arsenal fan she was, I planned to fulfill her small request.

* * *

I always feel it, but the difference between away and home games is significant.

Besides the travel distance, even the smallest unfamiliar elements can irritate a player's sensitive senses.

In that sense, playing the second leg of the Europa League quarter-final at home was a huge advantage.

Arsenal players must be preparing for the match in Parma's grim and uncomfortably designed away locker room.

The pillar in the middle of the room distracts from focusing on the coach, and the shower's weak water flow leaves players feeling sticky.

It's a psychological obstacle course designed to hinder the away team.

Of course, we weren't the only ones doing this.

Every team uses such petty tricks to bother the away team.

Some teams even make the shower floor slightly slippery so players can't wash comfortably.

In that sense, we could consider ourselves somewhat gentlemanly toward our opponents.

Even when stepping onto the field, away teams face all sorts of distractions.

Waaaaaah!

Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!

We're back in the stadium!

Not even COVID can stop us!

Minho! Minhoooo!

A few days before the Europa League quarter-final second leg, vaccinated spectators were allowed, and many gathered at Ennio Tardini.

Though it was only half the usual crowd, it was much better than nothing.

Playing in an empty stadium is oddly less fun.

Holding the hand of an escort kid and entering the field, the girl holding my hand asked, "Minho! We're going to win today, right?"

"How many goals should I score?"

The girl smiled brightly and held up all ten fingers. "100 goals!"

"Alright, I'll do my best."

100 goals, not 10.

Scoring 100 goals in one match?

It's not a realistic number, but I'll work hard for her.

Come to think of it, if I score today, it would be my 100th career goal!

Did the escort kid holding my hand know and say 100 goals?

A strange thrill made my heart pound.

Arsenal would be the victim of my 100th goal.

* * *

The first leg ended in a 2-2 draw, but overall, Arsenal had the upper hand in performance.

Both Arsenal and Parma knew this.

So did the fans who watched the game.

However,

No one, except Parma fans, expected Arsenal to struggle so much in today's match.

Honestly, even some Parma fans thought Arsenal would show decent performance in the second leg.

But as football fans unwrapped the game like a gift, they realized,

Ah, Park Minho is on a different level.

The performance he showed in the first leg was just a part of his skill.

-Minho! He's fast! He's showing the destructive dribbling he displayed in Serie B in today's match!

-Wow! Why has Henry reincarnated in Parma instead of Arsenal?

-Arsenal away fans who came to Ennio Tardini for today's match are holding their heads in despair!

Park Minho, who easily showed Henry's juggling dribble and broke through like Ronaldo, left Arsenal players stunned.

They wondered if this was the same Asian player they faced in the first leg.

"Why is he going wild like that?"

"Did he take some weird drugs?"

"I want to give those drugs to our players too. Come on, guys! Play properly!"

The screams of the few Arsenal away fans.

Their anguish was directed at Park Minho, who, after passing two defenders, scored a fantastic curling shot in the 6th minute of the first half.

-Gooooal!

-Minho with a fantastic goooooal!

-Minho scores his 100th career goal in the Europa League quarter-final second leg against Arsenal!

-Amazing! Minho! A fantastic goal!

Seeing Park Minho slide and hit the emblem like Henry, Parma's home fans screamed in delight, while the few Arsenal away fans fell silent.

The cheers from the home fans weren't just cheers.

They were the cries of fanatics worshipping a god.

Even after Park Minho nodded and looked at the fans before returning to his position, the cheers of Parma's home fans showed no sign of diminishing.

Watching from a distance, interim manager Per Mertesacker could only gaze at Park Minho with a look that seemed to ask, "What is that?"
