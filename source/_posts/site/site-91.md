## 34. Premier League Opening Match (1)

Amani Richards.

A player famous in the EPL for being an expensive English winger, but not a rough one—instead, he is a truly destructive and technical dribbler.

Thanks to this, he started to grow into the most anticipated player at Arsenal since he was 15 years old.

Moreover, his decent off-the-ball movement, whether on the flanks or in the center, further increased his value.

But that was it.

Dribbling, sprinting, off-the-ball.

Aside from these three abilities, Amani Richards was practically a half-baked football player with clumsy skills worse than a 15-year-old.

Despite his flashy dribbling skills, his unpredictable crosses and ‘killer cutbacks’ often caused headaches for Arsenal's U-18 coach.

His disappointing shooting skills and goal-scoring ability, worse than a stray dog’s, further lowered his value.

And if you asked whether he had good defensive contributions or stamina, Arsenal’s youth development head, Per Mertesacker, would firmly shake his head.

The previous coach, Kike Arteta, was confident that his good off-the-ball movement would translate to good team play, but his lacking football intelligence dashed those hopes.

Even Eddie, the ticket office staff at Arsenal, knew about the rumors that Arteta had to increase his headache medication because of Amani.

Anyway.

Amani was a vague asset.

He vaguely felt it, too.

He felt he was reaching his limits.

But, enchanted by his fantastic dribbling, he lightly ignored reality.

He was overflowing with confidence.

There were hardly any games where his dribbling efforts didn’t pay off.

The problem was that as time went on, his simple movements became readable to opponents.

Amani realized this only after he had sunk deep into the quagmire, but it was already too late.

While players his age were gaining experience through loans or as backups, only Amani Richards was not being utilized in proper matches.

So, he gritted his teeth this season.

He polished his dribbling skills even more.

To others, he still seemed lazy, but for the overconfident Amani, investing an extra 20 minutes in training was a huge effort.

However.

During the match against Celtic, he realized.

The dribbling he showed was just clumsy footwork.

“Minho!”

Everyone looked at the monstrous striker from Parma.

The dribbling Minho showed was entirely different from what Amani thought.

It wasn’t explosive, nor was it filled with flashy tricks like his own.

It was just… simple.

He broke through by running fast and faster.

Except for a flip-flap in the middle, Park Minho just ran fast and broke through.

In the end, he lightly flicked the ball past the rushing goalkeeper with a ‘tap’ to finish.

This was a shock to Amani.

Because he made football look too easy.

That’s how it seemed to him.

“If you can’t do it like this, give up dribbling.”

Hearing Park Minho’s words, he felt as if struck by lightning and wore a blank expression.

The match continued.

In the meantime, Amani Richards couldn’t focus on the game, just passing the ball around with a somewhat dazed look.

Even as Park Minho recorded another assist and was substituted, Amani kept pondering and pondering.

As if trying to find an answer.

* * *

You can’t change from the start.

Honestly.

If a player who relied on dribbling for over 10 years suddenly changed their play style, you could create a team of 11 Messis in a snap.

Well, I couldn’t help with Amani’s worries.

But seeing him more focused in training after the Celtic match, it was clear my shock therapy had worked.

Anyway.

Starting with the Celtic match, I practiced tactical movements with various Arsenal players during the preseason.

My personal form was much better than last season.

With help from the physical trainer I hired, I prepared for the rough body clashes and relentless schedule of the EPL.

Of course, this preparation wouldn’t make me perfectly ready.

I might hit a slump in the middle.

But preparing like this would be much more beneficial to my career than doing nothing.

Anyway.

The next preseason schedule was smooth.

In friendly matches against La Liga’s Elche and Osasuna, I showed decent form and synchronized well with Arsenal’s attacking line.

Time flew by quickly.

As many football fans bought season tickets and prayed for the Premier League to start, Arsenal’s opening match opponent was ‘Manchester United.’

[Korean Derby in the Opening Match!]

[Premier League Starts with a Big Match! Park Minho’s Arsenal vs. Shin Junseo’s Man U!]

[Ronaldo sincerely to Chinese Fans! ‘Enjoy the Wonderful Premier League, Chinese Fans!’]

[Man U Without Greetings for Korean Fans Despite Signing Shin Junseo]

- Man U, as expected.
- The worst of all time.
- Seriously... Why are you so disgraceful?
- How can you get more disgraceful as time goes on?
- Man U is doomed, lol.
- Sir Ferguson... the roots are disappearing!
- Ronaldo, as expected!
- Our Ronaldo is a good person.
- Is Ronaldo good?
- The Chinese fans are loving it, lol.
- Junseo, run away! Man U is not it!
- Is this the Chinese dream?

[Arsenal’s ‘Super Korean Day!’ Event for Park Minho, where Coach Alain in Hanbok eats Kimchi and Boiled Pork!]

- Arsenal is the best!
- Those Man U fans are loving it.
- We don’t have the Chinese dream, lol.
- Man U, your roots are falling!
- If it weren’t for Shin Junseo, Man U fans would have been silent and beaten up by Arsenal fans.
- Park Minho is a god.
- Hanbok, Kimchi, and Boiled Pork are the best!
- Unlike those who only eat Kimchi, Arsenal is different!

Well, it was bound to be a noisy match-up.

It’s the clash of the Big 6, Man U and Arsenal.

Junseo hyung contacted me when he heard about facing Man U in the opening match.

But he sighed deeply, saying Man U didn’t feel right.

- Something feels wrong.
- Maybe going to Serie A or returning to Bundesliga might have been the right choice.

It seemed something wasn’t fitting well.

But what could he do?

As a professional, he had to give his all in his position.

Anyway.

My Premier League debut was an away match at Old Trafford.

It was natural for Old Trafford, which could hold about 74,000 people, to sell out quickly.

It’s an opening match against Arsenal, after all.

If you don’t watch this game, you’re not a football fan, for sure.

With two highly popular clubs meeting, the atmosphere was heated from the moment we entered the stadium.

-Fxxk! Kill them! Kill them!
-This is your grave!
-Booooooo!

It was really hot.

Man U’s chants filled Old Trafford, pressuring Arsenal players.

I was a bit surprised by the home fans’ reactions, constantly yelling ‘You will lose!’ and ‘Don’t think of leaving alive!’ at the players warming up on the field.

“North London Derby is worse than this.”

Lorenzo Lupo’s words surprised me.

If non-derby games were like this, just how intense was the North London Derby that players’ expressions were so nonchalant?

Anyway.

Time flew by quickly.

Both teams’ players slowly entered the field.

The previously sparsely occupied seats were now completely filled, with no empty spots in sight.

Oh, that player is Ronaldo.

Cristiano Ronaldo.

He was certainly an extraordinary player.

Of course, both in a good and bad sense.

Today, Man U had Shin Junseo and Jadon Sancho on the wings, with Ronaldo at the forefront in a 4-2-3-1 formation, while Arsenal took out the 4-3-3 formation prepared during the preseason.

Beep!

The referee’s whistle blew.

The Premier League opening match.

The game between Man U and Arsenal began.

* * *

The enthusiastic cheers of Man U’s home fans.

Among them, Arsenal fans occupied the away section.

Gooners looked at the field with worried expressions.

“Can we win today?”

“I believe. We were really good in the preseason, right? We’ll surely show a good performance against Man U.”

“We have Minho, too.”

“Definitely... Minho will create something!”

They believed.

The striker who knocked them out in the Europa League quarterfinals last season was none other than Park Minho.

“If Minho, who eliminated Arsenal, is here, he’ll surely give those dumb Red Devils a hard time!”

“Please! Let’s win the opening match and go back in high spirits!”

The Gooners’ earnest wish.

In the game that started, the side that took control was naturally the home team, Man U.

- Man U! Pushing hard from the beginning!
- Ronaldooooo! Shoooooooot!
- Ah! The ball goes high!
- Man U’s attack is quite sharp!

Ronaldo, who shot over the goalpost, gave a thumbs up to Shin Junseo, who made the cross, with a disappointed expression.

The ensuing attack.

Man U aggressively shook Arsenal’s defense, centering on Jadon Sancho and Shin Junseo.

However.

Arsenal’s defense was more solid than expected.

Especially, the fullbacks were surprisingly excellent in suppressing the opponent’s breakthroughs.

- Man U continues to develop the game from the wings! But it’s not easy to finish due to Arsenal’s defense.
- Good. Kamiya is marking Jadon Sancho well.

Arsenal continued to focus on defense.

Since it was an away game, they couldn’t easily go on the offensive, and coach Alain had instructed them to play slowly for the first 15 minutes of the first half.

And a little over 15 minutes into the first half.

When Arsenal got used to Man U’s tempo, a counterattack started from Tyrone Tierney’s foot.

- Arsenal’s captain, Tyrone Tierney, with a devoted tackle! Cleanly takes the ball from Shin Junseo’s feet!
- The following pass! To Bruno Campos! And a long pass to the opposite wing! To Minho!
- Minho grabs the ball and runs! Minho!

“Focus!”

Luke Shaw blocked Park Minho’s path, responding to James McGuire’s shout.

But Park Minho shook Luke Shaw’s balance with a sudden change of direction and speed.

“Ugh!”

Losing in speed and body strength, Luke Shaw urgently reached out his hand.

He intended to foul and stop him before entering the danger zone.

However.

Despite Luke Shaw pulling his uniform, Park Minho didn’t fall and quickly took a shot a half-beat earlier.

A beautiful curling trajectory from a distance.

Park Minho’s shot curved neatly, avoiding Jordi De Gea’s hands and shaking the net.

- Gooooooal!
- Minooooo! Goooal!
- Takes a shot from a distance! Amazing! Minho! It’s fantastic!
- Mino, who transferred from Serie A’s Parma, scores his Premier League debut goal for Arsenal!

“Minooooo!”

“This is it! This is the play I wanted!”

“Hahaha! The player we didn’t want to face in the Europa League quarterfinals is now our striker! It’s crazy! Absolutely crazy!”

“Jade Kroenke! Keep him forever! Bring such a crazy player next season too!”

The Gooners in the away section cheered.

Wearing an Arsenal uniform, Park Minho ran towards the Korean flag waved by a Korean fan, thumping his chest and shouting.

“This is me! This is who I am!”

The Gooners went wild, cheering and celebrating Park Minho even more.

Minoooo!

Come oooon!

Seeing the Gooners, Park Minho was convinced.

It was quite a good debut match.
