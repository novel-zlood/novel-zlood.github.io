## 25. League Resumption (1)

Alright, enough with the gloomy stories.

It’s unfortunate that we were knocked out in the quarterfinals, but now we can watch the remaining matches as if we’re watching a fire across the river.

- Aaaaah! Messi!

- Messi finally scores in extra time! France sinks to Messi’s Argentina!

Argentina became the second team to advance to the semifinals, following England, by showing a miracle in defeating France.

- Italy defeats Belgium and advances to the semifinals! Italy is showing really solid defense!

- Amazing! Truly amazing!

Italy became the third team to reach the semifinals.

And in the last quarterfinal match between Croatia and Portugal, an upset occurred.

- Aaaaah! Ronaldo misses the penalty shootout, and Croatia advances to the semifinals!

- Croatia shows the strength they demonstrated in the 2018 Russia World Cup and secures the last spot in the semifinals!

Everyone thought that Ronaldo’s Portugal, burning their last flame, would defeat Croatia.

After all, three of Croatia’s main players were out due to injury, and their stamina was exhausted from the previous round of 16 match that went into extra time.

But Croatia managed to hang in there, enduring until the penalty shootout and eventually turning the tables.

The quarterfinals of the Qatar World Cup ended with the scene of Ronaldo throwing away his captain’s armband and kicking it.

[Argentina meets Croatia in the semifinals! Messi’s first World Cup victory is in sight!]

[England vs. Italy in the semifinals! Who will be the winner?]

[This World Cup is a confirmed hit! Will Messi be able to lift the World Cup trophy?]

Although Lionel Messi boasted a near-perfect career after winning the Copa America, it was still hard for him to let go of his longing for the World Cup.

In that situation, his opponent in the semifinals was Croatia, who had gone into extra time for two consecutive matches.

Naturally, Argentina, with more physical stamina, had a significant advantage over Croatia.

The world was buzzing with the title of the first World Cup victory for the Balkans vs. Messi’s first World Cup victory.

The other side was equally noisy.

[Group Chat Room]

- Roberto: Aaaaah! Yes! Italy will be the owner of this World Cup!

- Roberto: Hahaha! This is it! This is it!

- Roberto: This time, Italy is invincible!

Roberto, drunk with Italian pride, was running wild in the group chat, but not everyone in the chat had Italian nationality.

- Monica: Whoever wins, wins!

- Roberto: Traitor!

- Monica: It seems like I can’t hear the words of a loser with only one nationality?

- Roberto: Fool! Of course, you can’t hear it! If you can hear chat messages, that’s a mental illness!

For a moment, I wanted to pull out a meme of a certain fighter with the surname ‘Chu,’ but seeing Roberto’s 5,600-character rebuttal, I quietly held back.

- Monica: The winning team is our team.

With that one sentence, Roberto was crushed.

Other Korean friends remained silent.

It was quite entertaining to watch.

Anyway.

The semifinals were one-sided.

- Argentina advances to the finals! Messi! Messi is crying! Finally, the chance has come!

- This is really the last chance! If Messi wins the World Cup… we can confidently say he has surpassed Maradona!

Argentina’s advancement to the finals.

And on the other side, England defeated Italy 2-0 to advance to the finals.

[England vs. Argentina! The Qatar World Cup final match is set!]

[England, needing a victory since 1966 vs. Messi’s Argentina, aiming to make history]

[The Qatar World Cup, a huge success with this incredible matchup! FIFA is all smiles!]

When England defeated Italy.

Roberto typed a desperate message full of resentment.

Monica, excited, said she wouldn’t be going to Italy for a while and teased Roberto.

England and Argentina.

The final match between the two teams was undoubtedly a classic.

Although Messi carried Argentina with 2 goals and 1 assist, England made a comeback in the second half to win 4-3.

The match showcased how a team with excellent fullbacks could generate various attacking routes.

The image of Messi looking up at the sky with a bitter smile and the scene of England players crying with joy after winning the World Cup for the first time since 1966 were captured by the cameras, marking the end of the final.

After the match, Messi received the Golden Ball award.

Messi also won the Golden Boot for the most goals scored in the World Cup, while I received the Silver Boot, and Harriet Kane received the Bronze Boot.

It’s time to return to daily life.

My first World Cup ended like this.

* * *

“Waaaa!”

“Thank you for your hard work!”

“We are proud of you! Taegeuk Warriors!”

“Minho, player!”

“Junseo oppa!”

After finishing the World Cup schedule, we returned to Korea, rested for a few days, and then Junseo hyung headed to London while I went to Milan.

Before going to London, Junseo hyung said:

“Prepare to move to a bigger stage.”

I immediately understood what he meant.

It was a suggestion to quickly transfer to a team where I could play on the dream stage called the ‘Champions League.’

At the same time, I realized that Junseo hyung’s transfer talks were also progressing to some extent.

I wondered which team he was planning to transfer to.

Various talks started after achieving the feat of advancing to the quarterfinals for the first time in an away match.

There was talk about military service exemptions.

Well, I didn’t pay much attention to it.

I was already a reserve sergeant.

Junseo hyung also seemed not to care much since he had already received a military service exemption from the Asian Games.

He said he would refrain from making any comments for the sake of the juniors because any remarks could just add fuel to the fire.

Indeed, considering that the issue of military service exemptions is always a highly sensitive topic in Korea, this choice seemed somewhat wise.

Given the achievement of advancing to the quarterfinals for the first time in an away match, I believed we would be recognized quietly if we stayed silent.

The overall reaction wasn’t bad either.

I had no particular reason to bring up the topic, so I didn’t look for any more news about it.

After passing through Milan Airport and taking a bus back to Parma, I saw a teary-eyed newcomer joining the club a few days later.

“Soy un idiota…!”

Seeing the guy constantly muttering “I’m an idiot” in Spanish, it seemed his mistake in the final was haunting him.

But he did well.

In this World Cup, the newcomer, who recorded 4 assists, frequently changed the flow of the game as a super sub.

Aside from the mistake that led to a goal in the final, his fantastic pass assisting Messi’s last goal and his active defense brought tremendous energy to Argentina’s flanks.

“Minho! Santiago! Jordan! Are you all okay?”

Coach Alain Levagne, whom I hadn’t seen in a while, looked at the players who had returned from the World Cup with a worried expression.

My condition wasn’t bad.

However, I thought there might be an issue with physical stamina.

Considering the Serie A schedule resumes on December 31st, a few days of rest would be enough to recover.

After finishing light training in the morning, I headed home early today.

On my way, I saw the city of Parma, and maybe it was the aftermath of being knocked out in the semifinals, but there were strangely some scorch marks on buildings, which was eerie.

I almost thought a real war had occurred.

I realized once again that Monica’s decision to refrain from visiting Italy for a while was wise.

Still, seeing the lively city of Parma, I felt something.

It felt like coming back home.

But… what’s that?

[Let’s promote Minho’s naturalization to Italy!]

Seriously, what is that?

Why would I naturalize to Italy?

* * *

Recently, there has been a significant shortage of strikers in the global football scene.

Of course, there are many outstanding goal-scorers.

Especially, many versatile strikers have emerged, excelling in all aspects.

However.

It’s also true that their goal-scoring ability is somewhat lacking.

The tournament that highlighted this was the recent World Cup.

Unlike the versatile strikers who struggled, teams with excellent goal-scoring strikers performed well.

Exceptions would be Croatia and Argentina.

Croatia wasn’t a team that reached high positions with overwhelming scoring ability initially.

And Argentina had that 'Messi.'

Anyway.

Scouts from various clubs, who were impressed by the outstanding strikers in the World Cup, told their bosses.

“To win, we need a striker. A striker with overwhelming goal-scoring ability.”

And the player who caught the attention of these clubs was a Korean striker who won the Silver Boot in the Qatar World Cup, with a buyout clause of just 52 million euros.

“We must sign him!”

“I guarantee… Minho will succeed in the EPL.”

“52 million euros is pocket change. Just go for it!”

“Our club record is 115 million euros. Minho costs less than half of that!”

Scouts from various clubs shouted, spitting as they spoke.

They insisted that to become winners in the upcoming winter transfer market, they must sign the Korean player.

[Real Madrid interested in signing Park Minho!]

[Inter already considering specific wages and terms for Minho’s transfer!]

[Arsenal joins the race to sign Minho.]

[Striker shortage! Clubs start approaching various strikers!]

Naturally, Parma waited.

In a situation where they couldn’t sell Park Minho for more than 52 million euros, they had no intention of selling him this winter.

While rumors about Park Minho’s transfer were spreading again, Napoli, who would face Parma on December 31st, was also busy.

Serie A league 8th place.

After finishing 4th in the league last season, Napoli fell apart this season.

Especially, their defensive organization showed many issues.

As a result, they suffered significant defeats against Inter and Lazio, leading to their current position.

Napoli’s coach Vittorio Grava quietly analyzed Parma’s game, contemplating how to stop that annoying Asian leading Parma’s attack.

But he couldn’t find a way.

Even when Park Minho played in South Korea, where the squad was weaker than Parma, he continued to score goals despite all the marking.

Though time was passing, Vittorio Grava couldn’t come up with a perfect strategy to stop Park Minho.

As the scouts gathered at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, the spectators flocked in.

Yes, it meant that December 31st had arrived.

On the match day, Napoli’s coach Vittorio Grava rubbed his tired eyes, filled with dark circles, and looked at the field.

* * *

Finally, Serie A is starting again.

The 14th round match against Napoli.

Stadio San Paolo.

No, now it’s called Stadio Diego Maradona, and there were many spectators.

The cheers from home fans could be heard even in the locker room.

It meant that many spectators came to see the league resumption after a long break.

As I stepped onto the field, hearing the rough Italian curses, I realized.

Ah, I’m really back in Italy.

The World Cup is finally over.

The gloomy newcomer, who had been down since the runner-up finish, seemed to have snapped back to reality after hearing the Italian curses he hadn’t heard in a while.

Well, other players seemed quite excited to see the spectators after a long time.

The opponents were also similar.

They too seemed highly motivated, looking at the stands with determined expressions.

- The league resumes after the World Cup! We are broadcasting the 14th round match between Napoli and Parma.

- How do you see today’s match?

- Well, I think Parma, with most of their key players sufficiently rested, has the upper hand. However, their ace Minho played a lot during the World Cup, which can’t be overlooked.

- On the other hand, many Napoli players were called up to the national team, and several key players are out due to injury.

- It’s not a favorable situation for Napoli.

The match began.

Running on the field as a member of Parma after a long time felt different from playing for the national team.

“Minho!”

Kenneth waved confidently.

It was a long time since we matched our moves.

Receiving my light pass, Kenneth took an unhesitating shot, shaking Napoli’s net.

- Goooooal! Parma scores an opening goal against Napoli in just 7 minutes of the first half!

- The scorer is Kenneth! Marsetico!

- Despite not playing together for a while, Minho and Kenneth’s coordination is excellent!

Wow, just putting it in seamlessly.

It seemed he had intensely trained his basics during the World Cup break.

His touch looked like it reached the Serie A average level now.

Moreover, his body looked more perfect.

He was slightly sleek yet intimidating, now truly resembling a bear.

Thanks to Kenneth’s upgraded physicality, showing an overwhelming presence in physical battles, I connected the ball without any problem despite Napoli’s strong marking.

Of course, Napoli didn’t give up easily.

In the 31st minute of the first half, James Osimhen’s equalizer brought Napoli back into the game.

As expected, they were not an easy opponent.

We need to widen the score gap again, right?

We can’t afford to lose the first league match after the World Cup just like that.

- The ball is connected to Minho!

- He’s dribbling up slowly.

- Minho! Minho! Minho!

At the end of the first half, I got an opportunity.

I had no intention of missing this chance.

After connecting the ball to Kenneth, I immediately demanded a return and penetrated Napoli’s side.

- Minho! He receives the return and breaks through!

- He’s fast! Gaining speed!

After a clean pass to the center, where Gennaro was, I slightly moved out to the opposite side, and the ball was right at my feet.

Ta-da.

A magic trick where the ball disappears and reappears.

I could see the opponent’s defensive line panicking at our tiki-taka.

The Napoli goalkeeper quickly came forward, but…

What’s the point?

It was already too late.

Swoosh!

A lob shot cleanly over the goalkeeper’s head shook the net.

- Gooooooal! Minho scores a lob shot over the goalkeeper’s head!

- A fantastic goal at the end of the first half! Parma starts leading again with 2-1!

Without thinking, I ran to the away supporters’ section.

I should greet the Parma fans after a long time.

“Minhooooooo!”

“Waaah! Our fantasy star!”

“Minho! You are the best! Minhooooo!”

“If you naturalize to Italy, I’ll give you my daughter!”

“Waaah! Park Minho!”

Ignoring the strange (?) remarks, I just patted the Parma emblem and nodded.

The cheers grew even louder.

Yeah, this is why I score goals.
