## # The Beginning of a Fairy Tale (3)

[Parma secures victory with Minho Park's hat-trick!]

[Parma wins 5-3 against Lazio!]

[Parma has faced all Serie A teams up till the 19th round, maintaining victories!]

[Now halfway through Serie A! The championship-winning teams are becoming clearer!]

[A 10-point difference from second place Inter! Can Parma truly write a fairy tale?]

[Minho Park shows his jersey number to an away fan asking where Parma's god is!]

A victory against Lazio.

With continued wins, the atmosphere within Parma was at its peak.

After the game, Lazio's away fans were utterly excited, causing a ruckus. I think I saw the best flare display I've ever seen in my professional career.

Wow, seeing those flames burning like crazy made me think, "Isn't this going to cause a fire?"

Well, Lazio will pay the fine, but Parma will have a headache cleaning up the mess.

Anyways.

Maintaining a good mood with our winning streak, we rotated our squad and faced Genoa in the 20th round of the league on January 30th.

- Ah! Genoa! Genoa scores 6 goals!

- The match ends 6-3! Parma reveals significant defensive issues, recording their first defeat of the season!

The first league defeat.

I was substituted in the second half to try and change the outcome, but it wasn't an easy match.

It was tough to catch up with a team that had already scored 5 goals.

Honestly, signs of this defeat started showing from the game against Napoli on December 31st.

We hadn't had a clean sheet since then.

We kept conceding goals.

It reminded us that Parma compensated well for this with their attacking power.

Still, there wasn't any sudden drop in morale or internal conflict within the team, so I didn't think it was a big problem.

It was easier to think of it as a minor discord that occurred in the process of fine-tuning our teamwork.

Our defense thought so, too.

The staff at Parma also thought so.

Anyways.

On another note, Monica has been busy lately and hasn't been able to contact me often.

Sometimes she sends me text messages saying she's depressed because she can't come to Italy.

She says working in Paris is too tough.

So I advised her to imagine me going to Arsenal, and she suddenly cried, which surprised me.

- Minho Park: Why are you crying?

- Monica: Because imagining you coming to Arsenal is an unattainable dream... :(

Geez... Monica's blind love for Arsenal is quite something.

But I was relieved to see her cheer up a few days later.

The next match was against Torino.

We drew 1-1 in this match, making it a season where we drew all our matches against Torino.

Well, after two consecutive poor performances...

The Korean community started to get heated again.

Now they weren't attacking me but my teammates.

[Isolated Minho Park! Is it because of Joshua's low activity?]

[Minho Park recorded only 2 shots against Torino! The poor performance of the players supporting the ace is too noticeable!]

Geez... Weren't they calling me overrated before?

The media also eagerly pointed this out.

To be honest, I wanted to say that I can't always be in top form.

As the team's ace, my performance fluctuates depending on my form, and I thought other players' performances could also vary depending on their condition.

Anyways.

We gained only 1 point from the last two matches.

Naturally, Inter started to catch up quickly.

The 10-point gap in points narrowed down to a 5-point difference.

With the unfavorable atmosphere continuing...

We needed an opportunity to turn the situation around.

And within the team, there was an opinion that we needed to win the Coppa Italia quarterfinal match against Atalanta to reverse this atmosphere.

I agreed with that.

Although we were focusing less on the Coppa Italia this year compared to last year, I thought it was a perfect match to break the bad streak in the league.

Our coach seemed to be considering using a 1.5-string squad for this match, and I trained with Yoan Bojani and Gennaro Tatis, who were starting after a long time.

It wasn't a bad combination.

Kenneth and Filippo.

When I play with them, I tend to focus on linking up, but Gennaro and Yoan often expect me to finish, so the number of my shots naturally increased.

Except for the central midfielders and me, Boston Bartok, everyone was a rotation member, but during training, it felt like a squad that could handle Atalanta.

But.

Atalanta seems like a team that gives us generously.

It feels like we meet them often when we need a win.

* * *

Including last season and this year, Parma and Atalanta have faced each other a total of three times.

And with this match, it will be the fourth meeting, and Atalanta wasn't fond of facing Parma.

A team similar to their tactics.

To face Parma, who runs like mad dogs, Atalanta also needed a lot of activity, so their players tended to avoid facing Parma.

On top of that, Minho Park, known as Parma's 'god', showed particularly strong performance against Atalanta, which made them dislike facing Parma.

But.

Atalanta was in a rather unfavorable situation as they faced Parma in the Coppa Italia quarterfinals.

However, seeing Parma slightly shaken from late January, they had a glimmer of hope.

“There are more gaps than I thought.”

“We can do it.”

“Honestly, Parma is nothing without their attackers.”

“Minho? If we can just block that guy, we might have a chance...”

Seeing Parma's 1.5-string squad for this match, Atalanta was convinced.

They had a chance to win this match.

Because Atalanta was putting all their effort into winning the Coppa Italia this time.

6th in the league.

With an 8-point gap from 4th place Lazio, it was tough to secure a Champions League spot, so Atalanta shifted their focus early.

A match between a team running for the Coppa Italia championship and a team giving up on the Coppa Italia to maintain their league lead.

Anyone could see that Atalanta had a higher chance of winning.

The problem was that Oriental player at the forefront.

They were worried about how to stop the monster who always recorded attacking points against Atalanta.

Coach Gasperini even adapted a strategy with two markers, which Lazio used effectively in the first half, to fit Atalanta's tactics.

It was a preparation close to perfection.

However, just 7 minutes into the match between Atalanta and Parma on February 8th, Parma scored the opening goal.

- Gooooooal!

- Gennaro Tatis's fantastic non-stop shot shakes Atalanta's net!

- This is it! The player who received Minho's passes the best last season is Gennaro Tatis!

The Parma 'god' Minho Park, whom Atalanta was wary of, gave them another bad memory.

* * *

Atalanta feels familiar.

The coach, the players, and even the fans.

Unlike the other rough Italian soccer fans, Atalanta feels strangely familiar.

Of course, it's true that the home fans' gazes, staring at me like they want to kill me, are a bit scary.

But compared to other teams, this is like an angel.

Lazio or Juventus fans are much worse.

Anyways.

A goal scored 7 minutes into the first half.

I recorded an assist.

Atalanta allowed a goal early by leaving space behind them.

To be honest, I'm completely familiar with the characteristics of Tobin Gosens, the left wing-back marking me.

Maybe that's why it's fun to play against this guy.

Should I say it's fun to outplay him?

Of course, this guy was cursing me in Italian, looking at me.

Well, as long as it's not a racist remark, I can take it as a lullaby-level insult.

“You bastard.”

Maybe it's a compliment.

When I hear such harsh words from the opponent, it oddly feels thrilling.

Ah, of course, I'm not a pervert.

The real pervert is Yoan Bojani, who started playing hide-and-seek with Atalanta's three-back.

This guy's strength lies in his incredible positioning, and based on that movement, Atalanta's defense was greatly shaken.

Swoosh!

As soon as I passed the ball to Yoan, who cut through the field, a 1-on-1 chance with the goalkeeper was created.

Of course, Yoan Bojani, who received the ball, pulled it back with a heel kick like a madman.

Midfielder Ferelle, who had already moved up, received the pass and took a shot.

- Gooooooal!

- Yoan Bojani shows extreme selflessness!

- Hahaha! Who could imagine pulling the ball back with a heel kick in that situation?

- Really... This player is incredible.

- Anyway, Ferelle Canassini, who moved up to a high position, scores a fantastic goal to seal the deal!

Two goals in just 15 minutes into the first half.

Atalanta's coach Gasperini was hurriedly making adjustments, but Atalanta's defense seemed to be in a bit of a panic.

* * *

“Phew…”

I sighed.

I thought this was our chance, seeing Parma's recent poor performance.

But.

Parma was still Parma.

No, to be precise, ‘Minho’ was still ‘Minho.’

He was controlling the game all by himself.

Clearly, Parma's squad was close to a 1.5-string level, but it was Atalanta, who fielded all their starters, that was trailing 2-0.

After finishing the first half 2-0.

Even after trying various strategies during halftime to prepare for the second half, Minho Park, who had great chemistry with Gennaro Tatis today, created another chance.

Although Gennaro Tatis has recently been pushed from the starting lineup, he consistently scored attacking points when he played, showing excellent teamwork with Minho Park.

Tap tap!

- The second half starts with Parma's continued attack.

- The fantastic combination of Minho and Gennaro!

“Minho!”

Gennaro Tatis called out Minho Park's name.

Receiving his pass, Minho Park elegantly broke through Atalanta's left flank.

A smooth combination like flowing water.

As Atalanta's flank was pierced, coach Gasperini closed his eyes tightly.

Of course, it ended with Minho Park’s finish.

Swish!

- Gooooooal!

- Minho Park scores his 33rd goal of the season! He shows a perfect performance against Atalanta today by scoring!

Atalanta's home fans, who were watching the game with gloomy expressions, held their heads.

Some angry fans even hurled harsh insults at Atalanta's players.

Standing in front of Parma’s traveling fans, Minho Park spread his arms wide, and Atalanta’s coach Gasperini sighed deeply as he watched.

* * *

[Minho Park's 33rd goal of the season! He leads Parma to victory in the Coppa Italia quarterfinals!]

[Atalanta's defense overly focused on Minho Park!]

[Atalanta fans' doubts towards coach Gasperini.]

[Can Parma, who broke the recent bad streak, win again in the league?]

[Next opponent is Bologna! Parma, who saved their starters' energy, wants a win!]

[Global football fans' attention on Serie A! Who is ‘Minho Park of Parma’?]

[‘We wish Minho Park stays at Parma forever!’ Parma fans start holding signs!]

[Can Parma truly become the protagonist of a fairy tale?]

[Parma's fairy tale has already begun!]
