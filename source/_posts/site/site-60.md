## 22. The Man of the Europa League!(1)

Why is the Professor from Arsenal looking for me?

Curious, I looked at him and he answered with a smile.

He was like a ghost.

“I’m not here to ask you to transfer to Arsenal.”

“I just have one question.”

I asked back to our Professor Wenger.

A question?

“A question?”

“Yes, a question.”

What could he be so curious about?

Various questions flashed through my mind, but his question was different.

“Which player would you like to be among Roberto Baggio, Ronaldinho, and Lionel Messi?”

It was an unexpected question.

I answered immediately without filtering my thoughts.

“Can’t I be all three?”

Our Professor Wenger laughed heartily at my answer.

Leo and I were both surprised by the laughter, which was different from what I had imagined.

Why on earth was he laughing like that?

I couldn’t understand.

Our Professor Wenger nodded with a grandfatherly, warm look in his eyes.

“I see.”

He nodded with a look of realization, but I still couldn’t understand why.

He asked again.

“Then, among the three I mentioned, which player do you want to resemble the most?”

“Roberto Baggio.”

“Why?”

“Ronaldinho’s play style is definitely flashy… but he lacked self-discipline…”

Yes, Ronaldinho’s self-discipline was lacking.

Other than that, he was a flawless player in his prime.

“And Messi is Messi. How could anyone resemble him?”

It would be great if I could resemble Messi, but…

His style doesn’t really match mine.

Moreover, it’s impossible to completely emulate his style.

“So, Baggio?”

“Well… yes.”

Although I said this…

I wanted to incorporate the strengths of all three.

That’s my goal.

That’s why I’ve been analyzing videos of the three in depth recently and trying to emulate them in training.

“I see.”

“Yes.”

“Do you know what I felt watching your play in today’s match?”

“I’m not sure.”

What did he feel?

I didn’t particularly feel like I had improved.

“I thought, ‘This player is finally starting to establish his own style…’”

“I was a bit surprised to see that a player who was busy emulating the strengths of other players was finally establishing his own play style.”

I stared blankly at our Professor Wenger.

“The first time I saw you was… yes! It was the Coppa Italia quarter-final against Inter on February 9, 2022.”

“You scored two goals… and that’s when I first thought about you.”

“I thought a second Ronaldinho had appeared in Serie A.”

Yes, in that match, I was in such good condition that I could emulate Ronaldinho’s flashy skills.

I single-handedly dismantled Inter, just like in today’s match.

“Then, you looked like Messi. Ah! I don’t mean the play style… just like Barcelona has Messi, Parma had you.”

“You deserved to be called a god at Parma. Watching your performance in the Coppa Italia final, I saw Messi in you.”

It was a bit embarrassing to receive such high praise.

Of course, Professor Wenger’s praise didn’t stop there.

“But I was worried that you were a player wearing a ‘patchwork quilt’ of other players’ strengths.”

“At first, I didn’t see it positively.”

“A player in his mid-twenties who still hasn’t established his own style…”

“I thought your form might collapse soon. You were an unfinished player.”

While others praised me as already being a complete player, it seems that wasn’t the case for our Professor Wenger.

In fact, thinking about it, it made sense.

Though he appeared to like young prospects, our Professor Wenger actually preferred to sign undervalued or declining players in their mid to late twenties and regenerate them.

Considering his nickname before the Emirates Stadium was built was ‘Rehabilitation Factory Manager,’ he wasn’t just a coach who liked young prospects.

“Before today’s match, I thought…”

“It might be presumptuous, but I intended to advise you after the match to stop emulating others and establish your own style.”

“But watching today’s match, I realized I was wrong. You had already been gradually absorbing the strengths of other players to create your own style.”

I see.

That’s why he came to watch my match.

Looking into our Professor Wenger’s eyes, it seemed he still had the same passion for football as he did during his active career.

“I saw in today’s match… a modern Roberto Baggio…”

“I couldn’t help but shiver at the fact that such an impossible contradiction appeared before me…”

His gaze was a bit intimidating.

Even Coach Gino Inzaghi didn’t look at me like that.

“Is that so?”

“Yes, it was truly wonderful.”

“…”

“Oh, I’ve talked too much about myself.”

“No, it was an informative and interesting story.”

“That’s a relief.”

After the long conversation, we continued our meal.

It was an Asian fusion restaurant.

A fitting fusion Japanese cuisine for Professor Wenger, who loves Japanese food, and it was quite delicious.

More than that… it was a bit surprising that he didn’t mention transferring to Arsenal.

He was practically a lifetime manager for Arsenal.

Seeing my reaction, Professor Wenger laughed.

“Does it seem strange that I don’t invite you to Arsenal?”

“No.”

“What if your divorced wife asked you, ‘My cousin is talented in football, would you like to take him and teach him?’ Would you teach that cousin?”

“No, I wouldn’t like that.”

Professor Wenger laughed and answered.

“I think so too.”

It was an answer that would make Monica tear up if she heard it.

I nodded with a smile at Professor Wenger’s answer.

I felt really fortunate to have met Professor Wenger today.

It was a truly beneficial time, as I could organize all my recent thoughts.

* * *

The beginning of the season in the four major leagues was chaotic.

Unexpected teams were leading each league.

Soccer fans trembled, saying, “Is the world going to end like this?”

Burnley was leading the EPL.

Espanyol was leading La Liga.

Frankfurt was leading the Bundesliga.

Finally, our Parma was leading Serie A.

Of course, it’s still the beginning of the season.

The rankings will likely change in the next 2-3 months, and the teams competing for the championship will emerge.

Anyway.

Let’s cut off the early atmosphere of European football leagues here.

Talking about Serie A Round 5… we won.

The opponent was Fiorentina.

They showed a nearly ten-back defense against us, just like they did in their draw against Inter.

It was 0-0 until the 32nd minute of the second half.

Kenneth’s goal finally broke the deadlock, and we narrowly won 1-0.

It wasn’t a match where I played particularly well.

But the Parma fans still applauded and cheered for me.

Parma recorded 4 wins and 1 draw in 5 league matches.

The good atmosphere continued.

If we could maintain this momentum, we could end the season with a good result.

“Minho! Hurry up!”

“Alright, I’m coming.”

It was a rare day off.

But the players gathered in a large auditorium set up in a corner of the club’s office.

The club staff were operating the projector.

Their eyes were filled with anticipation and tension.

“Which group will we be in?”

“Anywhere but Moscow would be good…”

“Sure, the long distance is quite burdensome.”

“Ah! It’s starting!”

The projection screen started displaying the Europa League group stage draw, and the players, who had been idly chatting, all sat down and watched.

The first pot seemed to be all decided.

Group A: Lokomotiv Moscow

Group B: Arsenal

Group C: Leipzig

Group D: Atalanta

Group E: AS Roma

Group F: Sevilla

Group G: Dinamo Zagreb

Group H: Red Star

There were a lot of tough teams.

In particular, some teams looked like they could compete in the Champions League.

“Atalanta and Sevilla too?”

“Ah… I really hope we don’t get drawn there… That would be so annoying.”

“Hope we avoid Moscow too.”

“What pot are we in?”

“We’re in the third pot.”

The second pot started being drawn slowly.

The outline of the ‘group of death’ began to emerge.

Santiago sighed deeply when Marseille was drawn into Group A.

He closed his eyes, praying, “Please, avoid that group!” when Celtic was drawn into Group C.

Finally, when LASK Linz was drawn into Group H, he prayed fervently for us to be drawn into Group H.

“Minhooo!”

“Why are you suddenly calling me?”

“Because you’re the god of Parma… If we pray to you, maybe we won’t be drawn into Group H?”

The players all looked at me and started praying with clasped hands, saying, “Minho-men…!”

No, even if I pray, will we really get drawn into Group H?

-As Wolfsberger is drawn into Group G, Parma Calcio joins Group H!

“Huh?”

What is this?

Is everything going to work out so easily?

Contrary to my puzzled expression, the Parma players were ecstatic.

“Almighty Park Minho!”

“Woohoo! Minho! Minho! Minho!”

“The god of Parma is different!”

“Everyone, worship Minho!”

But it wasn’t over yet.

An incredible result came out of the fourth pot as well.

[Group H: Servette FC!]

Group H was formed with three ‘manageable’ teams aside from Parma.

Of course, the Parma players knelt and cheered for me.

“Minho-men!”

“Minho-men!”

Is this really okay?

Isn’t this rigged? Rigged?

* * *

[Parma! Green light for advancing to the Europa League knockout stage!]

[A manageable Group H for everyone! Who will be the winner?]

[The group of death for Arsenal! Facing Athletic Bilbao, Beşiktaş, and Maccabi Haifa!]

[Hellish away matches in Turkey and Israel await Arsenal!]

[AS Roma vs. Leicester City! Who will be the top of Group E?]

[Atalanta, Parma, Roma! All get favorable group draws!]

[Coach Martinho: “Just like we won the Europa Conference League, I will lead AS Roma to win the Europa League this season.”]

[Coach Alain Levagne: “I am confident we can advance to the next stage if we play without complacency.”]

-There’s a possibility!

-I never dreamed things would go so well in both the league and the Europa League.

-Most of the Serie A teams got decent groups.

-The worst group is definitely Arsenal’s.

-Wow… Hellish away matches in Turkey and Israel?

-Arsenal should be thankful they didn’t also draw Moscow despite being in the first pot.

-Parma! Let’s advance to the Europa League knockout stage!

-Parma! Parma! Parma!

Everyone around me was laughing, but...

One person was crying.

-Monica: This is a lie...

-Monica: Don’t joke! 14th place in the league, away matches in Turkey and Israel? Plus Athletic Bilbao? Why are we the only ones stuck in a group like this? Huh?

The chat was filled with angry messages.

I quietly closed the chat window.

In times like this, it’s best to stay silent.

-kingwangjangyube: LOL hellish away matches!

-Monica: Laughing?

Yes, until someone becomes a sacrifice.

Goodbye…

Bianconeri!
