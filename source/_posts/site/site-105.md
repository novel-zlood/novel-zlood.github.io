## 39. Scoring Competition (3)

After my opening goal went in.

The game started to get a bit rough.

Considering that Chelsea, a prestigious club, is not a team that would be shaken or mentally collapse with just one goal, I didn't realize that they were getting a bit rougher.

But it wasn't like that.

I could feel the impatience from Chelsea's players.

I thought for a moment about why that might be.

It seemed to be because the team, excluding a few players, was composed of those under the age of 24.

The young players were showing their impatience, and the efforts of Chelsea's veterans to calm them down were visible.

Especially Kante, who at the age of thirty-two was practically dominating the midfield alone, tirelessly harassing Arsenal's midfielders.

Anyway.

As the young players over there started playing rough, our young guys also started getting rough, and the game gradually became quite rough.

-The game is getting rougher.

-The referee raises a card. Arsenal collects their third card of today's game.

-Counting Chelsea's cards... A total of 7 cards have been issued in the first half of this match.

"Calm down!"

"Focus on the game!"

Whether it was due to the veterans' shouts from both teams, both teams started to spend time in a sluggish state from the 30th minute of the first half.

Waaaaaah!

Score another goal!

Pass the ball to Minho!

Now there's only a one-goal difference with Ronaldo.

Thanks to this, the cries of Gunners shouting to pass the ball to me could be heard on the field.

Of course, Chelsea's defenders must have been aware of this too, as they continued to stick close to me, marking me intensively.

"Ah... I don't want to rub against a man like this."

"I'm a married man."

I couldn't help but laugh at Ricardo Bastoni from Chelsea who persistently stuck to me, saying this.

"I also have a girlfriend at home who is like a pterosaur."

"You crazy guy."

Taking advantage of the moment Ricardo looked at me with eyes that said 'Are you crazy?', I made a big turn and dug in.

"Oops!" I heard his exclamation, and at the same time, the pass from Axel Odegaard precisely landed at my feet.

-Minho! Receives the ball in a good position!

-A great opportunity obtained at the end of the first half!

-He cuts inside and shoots straight!

-Ohhhh! Mendy! Mendy! A fantastic save! Chelsea's goalkeeper is insane today!

That guy messed up again.

As another good opportunity was missed due to Chelsea goalkeeper Mendy’s super save, I felt a sense of regret.

And with the referee's whistle, the fierce first half between the two teams came to an end.

* * *

Coach Alain Levagne thought.

This team is fascinating in that it collects cards more enthusiastically than anyone else when the game gets a bit rough.

Unlike Parma, which is composed of a calm squad and used cards to break the opponent's good opportunities, Arsenal’s players collected cards enthusiastically whenever there was a slight gap.

The only consolation was that Chelsea's young players were also burdened with many cards along with Arsenal.

Thanks to this, the second half began in a state of slightly reduced intensity compared to the first half.

Coach Alain Levagne, who had sweated it out trying to rearm his players' minds during halftime, nodded with satisfaction as he saw the players showcasing Arsenal's original football at the start of the second half.

However, it wasn’t that the rough atmosphere of the first half had been completely resolved, and unnecessary rough situations continued to emerge in the middle.

Fortunately, thanks to the referee warning the players with strong gestures from the beginning of the second half that they would see the red card if they got any rougher, there were no major issues until the 10th minute of the second half.

Yes, until the 10th minute of the second half.

"Aaaargh!"

The moment Park Minho fell clutching his ankle, Coach Alain Levagne was more furious than anyone else and shouted.

"Those XX bastards stepped on him! Red! Give a red card!"

Beep!

As the referee issued a yellow card to Chelsea defender Kamel Amerovic, who committed the foul, a huge booing erupted from Emirates Stadium.

Booooooo!

"He stepped on him!"

"That was a deliberate foul! Ref!"

"You X bastard! Are you blind?"

Despite the booing and swearing from the spectators near the field, the referee checked VAR, but the result did not change.

Everyone sighed in relief as Park Minho got up without any major issues.

"Damn it! Minho must not get hurt, even if it's anyone else! We need him to put that damn Ronaldo in his place!"

"Minhooooooo!"

"Kamel, you X bastard! I saw you! Huh?"

Even though Park Minho got up, the players from both teams growled at each other, engaging in a war of words.

In such a heated atmosphere, Park Minho slowly stood in front of the ball to take the free kick.

It was the second free-kick chance of today’s game.

The first chance was regrettably not a goal due to Mendy's save, but the Gunners fervently prayed that it would be different this time.

-Minho stands in front of the ball.

Everyone's attention was focused on Park Minho.

He slowly stepped back.

He took a deep breath.

* * *

"Phew..."

The atmosphere is not very good.

Rough play towards each other has intensified, and I just fell down screaming.

But there’s no good way to deal with it.

The young players are full of energy, so even if you try to control this part, it’s clear that it will flare up again.

So it’s better to reduce their momentum.

If we score an additional goal and end their will to chase, this heat will subside a bit.

Beep!

With the referee’s whistle, I looked ahead.

Beyond the wall of Chelsea players, Mendy the goalkeeper was looking at me, ready.

If I curl the ball, I can definitely score one.

But aiming for an unexpected angle with the outside of my left foot might not be a bad idea either.

‘Left foot outside shot.’

Yes, it seems better to go with this.

With that thought in mind, I quickly ran towards the ball.

The ball caught on the outside of my left foot curved like a banana, aiming straight for the goal beyond Chelsea’s defensive wall.

At the same time, I saw Mendy the goalkeeper dive.

Although the direction was the same, I was sure as I saw that his fingertips didn’t touch the ball.

This one went in perfectly.

Swoosh!

The ball hit the net cleanly.

Immediately, I ran towards the direction of the fans.

And for the first time in a while, I showed Henry’s celebration.

Ssshhh!

As I slid and showed Henry’s pose, the fans near the corner kick line burst into cheers.

"Waaahhhh!"

"Minhooooo! Yes! You are the king! The king of Arsenal!"

"Hahahahaha, this is it! This makes Minho tied with Ronaldo in the scoring rankings!"

The happy screams of the Gunners echoed.

Some even called out to God, enjoying the current situation.

There were old Gunners who were wondering if this was really the Arsenal they knew, which used to hover around 4th to 7th place.

Arsenal extended their lead to 2-0.

Naturally, the fiery determination of Chelsea players was doused with cold water, and the atmosphere subsided.

Jeremy Lukaku, who had been demanding the ball at the front, sighed deeply and shook his head.

That guy had given an unhappy interview before, and I wondered if he would do the same this time.

Well, it’s not the time to worry about others.

We also have a South American friend suffering from homesickness.

It seems no team is perfect.

Every team has flaws, and the results depend on how the team addresses those flaws.

In that sense, Arsenal wasn’t bad.

It didn’t have the incredibly tight-knit feeling like Parma, but it felt like it was slowly coming together as a team.

Anyway.

Chelsea couldn't recover the 2-0 gap and spent the second half like that, leading to Arsenal’s 2-0 victory over Chelsea at home.

[Minho’s multi-goal! Arsenal! Continues to maintain the top spot in the league by defeating Chelsea!]

[Minho, tied with Ronaldo with 18 league goals!]

[As we enter December, the competition for the top scorer intensifies! Ronaldo and Minho lead, followed closely by Abraham, Salah, and Lorenzo Lupo!]

[MOM is Minho! Sinking Chelsea with just 2 goals!]

[Minho, recording an incredible attacking point, is evaluated as the most powerful striker in the EPL this season!]

[Coach Alain Levagne: ‘It was a bit of a rough match, but fortunately, none of the players from both teams were injured.’]

-Come ooooon!

-Minho truly deserves to be the top scorer!

-Last season, Ronaldo started to falter from December. Minho will definitely win the top scorer competition.

-Salah is actually the more threatening opponent. He’s only got 11 goals now, but unlike Ronaldo, Salah consistently scores throughout the second half of the season.

-Factos!

-This is it! Minho’s real rival is not stupid Ronaldo! It’s Liverpool’s Salah. Factos!

-Factos!

-It’s been a while since I agreed with the Kop.

-Is this... a Gunner x Kop alliance? My heart is swelling!

-What? Alliance? Those guys... harass Hum-hyung?

-King but... Hum-hyung has such a good impact?

-Even as a 10-year Kop, I agree with that.

-But Hum-hyung has experienced the Big Ears that Arsenal never had, so let's call it a draw.

After the game, the Gunners went wild.

This was because my goal tally had tied with Ronaldo, who had been constantly provoking Arsenal in interviews.

Well, the Kops who joined in also enjoyed mocking Ronaldo and Man United.

That sight looked a bit fun.

I guess this is why Korean overseas football fans enjoy teasing Man United fans whenever they meet them.

It feels so satisfying.

[Ronaldo: ‘It’s just a tie. In the next match, I can widen the gap, and I believe Man United can surpass Liverpool to take the second place in the league.’]

It’s really amazing how this guy, even at thirty-eight, is so full of enthusiasm.

I should really learn from him in that aspect.

Of course, such over-enthusiasm often shows in a bad light, so I should be careful.

Anyway.

Having won against Chelsea, we now face four consecutive away games in December.

West Ham-Southampton-Lazio-Burnley.

There are no particularly threatening opponents or important matches.

But the schedule is so tight that physical management is definitely needed.

We need to handle this December schedule well to surpass that petty someone and gain the upper hand in the top scorer competition.

So we must put in extra effort for this away trip.

Now that I think about it, Man United’s next league opponent is Chelsea.

Facing us and then immediately facing Man United.

Their schedule doesn’t look too favorable either.

Anyway.

Our next opponent is West Ham.

A club that had a team that made racist remarks to Junseo hyung, who was formerly at Tottenham, and the team that was the start and main character of my professional debut episode.

The team’s nickname is the Hammers.

Their fans call themselves the Irons.

Their chant is famous for being the Bubbles chant.

The 'Bubbles' itself became a symbol of West Ham thanks to the chant ‘I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles’.

Monica was quite anxious ahead of this away trip.

With the notorious ‘Inter City Firm’ (ICF) hooligan group of West Ham being so infamous, she was worried that something might happen to me.

But there was nothing to worry about.

Just like popping bubbles with a needle, I just need to burst West Ham players.

Isn’t that too presumptuous?

Honestly, I think I have the skills to lead the team called Arsenal.

Don’t you think so?

Ah... Was I too cocky just now?

Monica doesn’t like it when I imitate someone like that.

I need to be more humble.
