## 51. What Does It Feel Like to Lose? (1)

Beep! Beeeeeep! Beep!

The whistle signaling the end of the match.

Manchester United players collapsed onto the field with expressions as if they had been thrown into a sewer.

Some players shook their heads with bitter smiles, while others sighed looking at the sky.

That’s what defeat is like.

Especially a home opener defeat.

The Manchester United players probably never considered the possibility of losing, making the sting even sharper.

More than that, Aches Parti, who idolized me, hesitantly approached and asked for my jersey.

Isn't James McGuire, who was frowning, scary?

“Here. You worked hard today.”

“You were really fierce today. I'll show you a hat-trick in the next match.”

A brief warm conversation.

As I was about to enter the locker room, Manchester United's coach approached me for a handshake.

“Minho.”

“Oh, it was a good game.”

“Minho. When will that bald manager be fired?”

“Pardon?”

“I'm sure. I can make you shine more than that delusional bald manager…”

“Hold on! Stop!”

And then.

Our coach cut him off with a sharp look.

Coach Helge smiled and went off to greet the other players. Meanwhile, our terminally ill 'legend' coach looked at me anxiously.

“You and I are Arsenal for life. Got it?”

“Of course.”

“Good. That damn guy dares to threaten my position. He has no ethics.”

Hmm... Helge's football style is quite interesting too.

But our coach also pursues entertaining football.

If our coach ever considers the national team, Helge might be a good replacement.

“Minho?”

He must’ve read my expression.

Our coach looked at me with eyes full of betrayal.

I just scratched my nose and turned my head.

* * *

[Opening Match Victory! Minho’s Hat-trick at Old Trafford]

[Coach Helge: ‘Minho is the best player in the world. The era of Messi and Ronaldo is over, and his era is coming.’]

[Coach Alain Levagne: ‘Minho has always been the best player in the world.’]

[Arsenal wins 4-1! Catastrophe at Old Trafford!]

[Minho! Hat-trick in the opening match! Leading Arsenal to Victory!]

[Where did the Arsenal that conceded hat-tricks go? Gooners thrilled by dominant performance!]

-Minhooooooo!

-We’re going to win the league this season too!

-Minho! He’s crazy! Absolutely crazy!

-Great news to start the season.

-What? Aches Parti? He’s worth more than double Minho but scores less than a third!

Was the opening match victory very sweet?

Monica came back from the dentist, saying she got a cavity treated, and carefully put an Arsenal jersey into the washing machine.

I’m not sure why she needed an Arsenal jersey to go to the dentist.

Anyway, the fact that Arsenal's victory at Manchester United’s home was sweet and fantastic enough to please Monica was clear.

After finishing the opening match and heading to the training ground for recovery training, Fabian was having a short conversation with Lorenzo.

His expression, now feeling a sense of belonging to the team, was noticeably brighter than on the first day of preseason.

Fabian seemed to now feel that he was a part of Arsenal.

Playing as a right wing-back in the recent match against Manchester United, Fabian showed decent skills and received good ratings, successful in his position switch.

“Wow! The house in front of the training ground belongs to Lorenzo? That’s amazing.”

Ah, he must be surprised by the story of Lorenzo buying and remodeling the grocery building into a house.

I once visited the housewarming, and indeed, the house was well-decorated, making me nod in approval.

Moreover, there was a small training ground in the backyard, showing how much effort Lorenzo was putting in.

Unlike how I emphasize ‘Effooooort!’ to Amani and Jules Kaembe, I didn’t need to say much to Lorenzo.

“Minho, Arsenal feels similar to Parma.”

“Really? I wouldn't know.”

“No, seriously. It’s quite similar.”

I’m not sure what he means by similar.

But, I think both Parma and Arsenal know how to win.

Of course, Parma now is a mid-table team in Serie A, but back when I played for them, Parma was definitely a strong team.

More importantly, Fabian seemed to have a strong desire in his eyes.

Maybe because he didn’t get to play much last season at Parma, he looked quite motivated.

Anyway, it’s the opening match.

Playing as a starter in an important away match against Manchester United must have boosted Fabian’s confidence.

The next opponent is Everton.

Most likely, except for a few players, everyone will be rotated out.

Not because Everton is weak.

Our coach likes to rotate heavily in the early season to elevate the performance of backup players for the second half.

Last season, even with injuries to key players, Arsenal managed an undefeated league win thanks to the maintained performance of backup players.

This season too, our coach plans to rotate boldly to elevate the players' performance.

Coincidentally, our opponent, who suffered a 1-0 defeat against Chelsea in the opening match, would be a good match even with rotations.

“Alright! That’s it for today.”

After a short recovery training, I bought Monica’s favorite fruits and headed home.

As soon as I arrived, Monica greeted me with a displeased look.

Did I do something wrong?

Wondering, I asked, and she shoved an article about the attacking midfielder Tottenham brought in for 73 billion won from Monaco.

[Dominik Jansen, who recorded 8 goals and 11 assists last season at Monaco, transfers to Tottenham!]

[Dominik Jansen: ‘I will lead Tottenham to victory like Arsenal’s No. 10. I am the best player.’]

“I don’t like it.”

“Does he think a little performance in Ligue 1 will work in the Premier League?”

“Damn Spurs! That ignorant and rude guy transferred to the EPL.”

Monica spewed out words like a machine gun.

Silently, I put an apple in her mouth, and she looked at me with desperate eyes.

“Alright. So, I just need to take revenge in the North London Derby in October?”

Only then did Monica’s face brighten.

Sometimes she is so simple.

That’s why she’s so passionate.

And she’s truly a beautiful person.

Swoosh-Swoosh!

Monica’s punches cutting through the air.

She seemed to be already looking forward to the North London Derby in October.

* * *

“Come on Arsenal! Come on Arsenal!”

The Arsenal anthem resounded loudly in the home ground, Emirates Stadium.

Arsenal, known for relatively quiet support compared to other clubs' supporters, was no more.

Last season’s undefeated league win and mini quadruple had restored great confidence to the Gooners.

Naturally, their voices were bound to get louder.

“Home is the best after all.”

Lorenzo smiled brightly, looking around the stands.

A red wave different from Old Trafford.

Though he started today’s match on the bench, he smiled brightly.

“Kaembe.”

“Yes, sir!”

“What’s the task of the front striker?”

“To create space for Minho to score and hold onto the ball as much as possible!”

“Good.”

Today’s match.

Lorenzo smiled with satisfaction at Jules Kaembe, who was playing as the front striker.

Having recently shifted to the winger position, Jules Kaembe stepped up to the front this time to utilize his excellent shooting ability.

Transferred last winter and playing only 13 matches, scoring 1 goal and 5 assists, his powerful shooting ability shown in every match was too good to be left idle.

“You find it hard to hold the ball with your body like me, so you need to keep switching with Gabriel to create space for Minho. Then you’ll definitely have a good chance too.”

Lorenzo, almost like a dedicated coach, was teaching all sorts of know-how to Jules Kaembe.

Coach Alain Levagne watched the scene with a satisfied smile.

Tyler Smith Rowe.

Park Minho.

Daniel Saliba.

Marlon Ramsdale.

Except for four main players, all positions were started by backup players.

Thus, scoring first was more important than ever.

Lorenzo sticking close to Jules Kaembe symbolized the importance of the first goal in today’s match.

It was time to enter the field.

Players headed to the entrance tunnel.

Even backup players matched the time and headed to the bench.

Everton fielded their full main squad, determined to secure a win in this match.

Everton players' eyes were on Park Minho, who was waiting with a relaxed expression.

“Minhooooo! Score a hat-trick today too!”

“You scored a hat-trick away, now it’s time to score a hat-trick at home!”

“Minhoooo! I love you!”

“I love you more!”

“I love you so much I’d follow you to hell!”

Leaving behind the confessions of love from the uncles, Park Minho led the players to form a circle.

“It’s the first home game of the season.”

“Remember the expressions of those Manchester United guys who got thrashed at home by us?”

“If we lose this game, we’ll be the ones sitting on the field with those expressions.”

“Let’s show them what kind of team we are.”

Captain Tierney's words ignited the players' competitive spirit.

“Don’t forget to keep switching! Keep moving so that Everton’s defense can’t settle!”

Coach Alain Levagne’s voice echoed through the field.

He hoped Jules Kaembe would show his real potential as a front striker in today’s match.

It might have been an excessive expectation.

Having changed positions to winger last winter and now shifting to the front after just half a season.

“But still, he’s better than Nicolas Pepe, and his cost is just a fraction of Pepe’s.”

Coach Alain Levagne exuded confidence, mentioning Arsenal’s worst signing.

The Gooners would surely nod in agreement hearing that.

That’s how cheap Jules Kaembe’s cost was.

And his talent was greater than any other player.

Many evaluated that in terms of physicality, he had higher potential than Park Minho.

-Jules Kaembe! It doesn’t seem like this is his first time playing at the front!

-Amazing! A perfect chance, but the shot is unfortunately deflected by Jonathan Pickford’s hand and goes out of bounds.

-Arsenal’s first corner kick situation.

Contrary to everyone’s worries, Jules Kaembe showed excellent movement at the front.

Moreover, his quick feet kept moving, confusing Everton’s defenders.

“Was Kaembe always this clean with his touch?”

“Is that the same fast-footed Jules Kaembe? He’s exchanging 1-2 passes with Gabriel?”

The Gooners at the stadium couldn’t hide their surprise at Jules Kaembe’s remarkable growth compared to last season.

As Everton's defense focused on the unexpectedly good Jules Kaembe and Gabriel Artieli.

Silently, an excellent opportunity came to Park Minho, who was moving in space on the left flank with Tierney.

-Minho! Minhooooo! A great chance near the box! Receives the pass from Jules Kaembe and shoots without stopping! Whoooooa! Goal!

-Minho’s first goal! A clean shot shakes Everton’s net! Arsenal takes the lead easily at home against Everton!

A lead goal scored in the 11th minute of the first half.

Park Minho slid on the grass, spreading his arms, passing the stunned Jonathan Pickford.

Waaaaaaahhh!

The cheers of the Gooners shook the Emirates Stadium.

They sang Minho’s chant, reveling in the joy of the first goal.
