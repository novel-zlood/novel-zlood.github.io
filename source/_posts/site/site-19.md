## 8. What can't he do? (1)

Two goals scored in an instant.

Park Minho and his friends' group chat quickly heated up with those two goals.

-MilanoLove: Uwaaah! This is it! This is it! The legend of AC Milan! Park Minho's multi-goal!

-RealMilan: Hahaha, what legend of AC Milan? The emperor of Inter, Park Minho's multi-goal!

-KingYuve: No, he's Juventus's...

-MilanoLove: Shut up.

The chat window quickly flared up.

The excited trolls spewed all sorts of letters, quickly filling the chat window.

-RealMilan: How dare a 7th place team talk to the Milan brothers who are competing for 1st and 2nd place?

-MilanoLove: Geez... smells like a joke, hahaha.

-KingYuve: ...

-RealMilan: Are you mad? Sensitive? It's a joke, why are you frowning like that?

They were convinced that one day Park Minho would transfer to the team they supported.

Of course, Roberto, who supported Parma, was different.

-Roberto: Who are you to talk about legends?

-Roberto: Minho still has 3 years left on his contract with Parma!

-Roberto: Everyone shut up! I want to be alone.

Even when they were chatting wildly, they got along well when Park Minho got the ball.

-Roberto: It's here!

-MilanoLove: Minho! Minho! Park Minho!

-KingYuve: Ah! Santiago missed that;

-RealMilan: Why does he keep doing that Marseille turn at such weird times these days?

Just like fans of a top star.

They started fighting again.

Monica, taking a quick break from work, glanced at the chat window and let out a giggle.

-Monica: So, is Minho doing well?

The chat window became lively again with that question.

Confirming that Park Minho was doing well, she smiled satisfactorily and went back in front of the camera for her modeling work.

[Parma's rising star! Park Minho. 2 goals and 1 assist!]

[Parma! Defeats Perugia 4-1!]

[Minho ranks 3rd in league goals and 1st in assists! Leading Parma's attack!]

[Coach Alain Lavant, 'Minho is a genius. Perugia was too easy for him.']

[Perugia angry at Coach Alain Lavant’s interview]

[Comments]

-Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho!

-Uwaaah! The bomber from Korea is burning Perugia!

-Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!

-Tied for 3rd in league goals with Gennaro Tatis... And he's 1st in assists! We got such an amazing player for free!

Simple reactions matching simple achievements.

The hot reactions to my performance weren't only from Parma fans.

Some Korean overseas football fans, who recognized me from the national team, also responded positively.

I'm becoming more famous.

And I'll get more attention, right?

"Agh...!"

"One more set."

So I have to try harder.

This lazy guy doesn't understand my pace and just thinks about how to skip this training.

Someone might say, looking at me,

Can't you slow down a bit?

I know.

I know I'm quite talented.

But the world is full of monsters with far more overwhelming talent than me.

They've played football longer than me.

They've trained more than me.

And even now, they spend more time than me.

So how can I just rest?

"Aaaargh! Minho! I'll kill you!"

Well, this lazy guy curses me, saying he's dragging himself into training hell.

But it's all training that becomes blood and flesh.

If you're upset, you should have scored in the last game.

"Minho! I'm at my limit! My limit!"

"Sir, you still have 3 sets left."

"Damn! Damn! Damn!"

"Oh! Your Italian has improved."

"This damn training! This damn teammate! This damn Minho!"

Santiago.

Seeing his Italian swearing improve, it seems he's finally properly adapted to the team.

More than that, I can feel his stamina improving.

To become a player who can show various plays, not just simple ones like now.

"Let's do one more set."

"..."

The lazy guy looked at me resentfully.

Lazy guy! I told you.

If you're upset, what should you do?

You should have scored in the last game.

[Serie B Round 7]

-Parma Calcio vs Ascoli

[Broadcast Comments]

-What's this? Why are they broadcasting Serie B matches?

-Park Minho has been doing well lately, so they're broadcasting Serie B too.

-They got the Serie A broadcast rights, and now they got the Serie B ones too.

-Oh, it's starting!

September 27, 2021.

Serie B Round 7 match against Ascoli.

Even before the match, the cheers of Ascoli home fans could be heard in the away locker room.

But here, it's quite gentlemanly.

The away locker room is much more comfortable than in other places.

Of course, there are some psychological elements that make players uncomfortable...

But it's much better than being physically uncomfortable.

I heard from Leo that the Serie B broadcast rights were bought in Korea.

Does that mean my parents and friends from my time in Korea can watch my matches now?

It feels strangely emotional.

I absolutely can't make any mistakes today.

Well, there was another reason I absolutely couldn't make any mistakes today.

I sneakily took out my smartphone and checked a sports article on a Korean portal site, and one article caught my eye.

[South Korea's A-team coach Pedro heads to Italy to observe Park Minho!]

Our coach Pedro came all the way to today's stadium to observe me.

Honestly, South Korea's opponents this time were Syria and Iran, and since both matches were away games, thorough preparation was necessary.

So I was curious.

Is there any reason to bring someone like me, who's a bit of a burden?

There are many players who are much better than me.

"Well... everyone has their reasons."

Honestly, it would be great to be selected for the national team.

If not, it would be some time to rest.

Someone might ask me, 'Don't you have any patriotism?' but...

Sorry, but...

I was a regular person two months ago.

I haven't had the luxury of forming an identity as a national team player, and I'm too busy adjusting to being a professional.

Moreover, unlike other players, I didn't have much attachment to the World Cup, Asian Cup, or Olympics.

If you ask why...

"Because I'm a reserve soldier."

Re.serve. Sol.dier, what a pleasant sound.

It oddly lifted my spirits.

I feel like today's game will go well.

* * *

Boooooo!

Ascoli's home stadium.

The boos from home fans at Stadio Cino e Lillo Del Duca poured onto the field.

The small stadium that only holds 12,000 people.

But their passion wouldn't lose to the nearly 100,000 home fans at Camp Nou for Barcelona.

"Impressive."

Coach Pedro let out a brief exclamation as he watched Park Minho, who started on the right flank today.

This player has grown even in the short month since his debut with the national team.

"You can see him growing."

It's not an average player's growth rate.

It was an explosive growth rate.

He now seemed capable of competing with other main players on the flank.

Moreover, his playing time and activity had significantly increased.

"The problem is that South Korea's attacking lineup is already full."

There's no room.

South Korea's attacking lineup, experiencing an unprecedented golden age, was evaluated as being on par with the lineup that created the glory of 2002.

It was honestly still a bit unsettling to insert Park Minho into such an attacking lineup.

His experience was one thing.

He wasn't sure if Park Minho had the ability to show the diverse plays he wanted.

That's why Coach Pedro planned to keep observing Park Minho until the final roster was announced.

Slap!

Boooooo!

The boos poured in again.

A goal scored by cutting inside and curling a left-footed shot, just like Arjen Robben.

Park Minho smiled brightly and slid in front of the home fans after scoring the opening goal with this simple yet destructive play.

A play that's simple yet hard to stop.

Coach Pedro burst into laughter.

"If Minho could play as a central midfielder, I'd take him without question..."

Again, mixed boos and cheers were heard.

Park Minho with the ball caught his eye.

Coach Pedro busily moved his pen, once again pondering how to utilize Park Minho.

* * *

After scoring the opening goal.

I got hit by a water bottle thrown by an Ascoli fan.

With a thud, my head throbbed.

Thanks to that, the game paused for a moment.

Tensions flared between Ascoli players and our team.

Swish!

A rough tackle came in. But before that, I made a low and fast cross with an outside front kick.

I saw Gennaro Tatis bring his head to my cross.

But the opposing goalkeeper, Nicola Relli, made a fantastic save, stealing my assist.

-Nicola Relli's fantastic save!

-It was dangerous! If they had conceded another goal while trailing 1-0, the momentum would have completely shifted.

Players' plays became rougher.

Probably because getting hit by the water bottle made everyone a bit irritable.

Honestly, if that lazy guy had been hit by a water bottle, I would have been a bit angry too.

Throwing something onto the field.

It's indeed bad manners.

The problem is that this tension causes rough plays, leading to injuries.

Like Franco lying on the field now.

A red card was shown.

And not just one, but two.

One for Ascoli's central defender Matia Viti, who tackled Franco from behind.

And another for Santiago, who ran at Matia in anger for Franco.

The field was a mess.

Boos and trash were thrown onto the field.

It was really the worst.

At that moment, the coach urgently called me.

"Minho! Minho!"

I ran urgently to the coach.

The coach told me to play in the center.

"So... as a central midfielder?"

"Yes, there's no one else who can play in the center. With both teams down to 9 players, there's no point in playing in the attacking midfield."

"A central midfielder..."

"Don't worry! Just play a bit deeper and connect the ball forward. Leave the rest to Marjan! Hey! Yann! Move to Minho's position!"

After explaining everything to me, the coach quickly replaced Franco with Yann Karamoh, positioning him on the right flank.

And put Gennaro Tatis on the left flank.

The second substitution was Gianluca for Glauco, stationed at the front.

The game resumed.

Marjan Kurtić, who became my partner, approached.

"Minho, if the pass is blocked, just play it long to the flanks. And if there's no angle, just connect it to me."

He seemed worried about me.

Honestly, I was worried too since it was my first time playing in this position.

But I can't just stand there and take it.

They injured Franco, who taught me so much, so they deserve proper retribution.

Of course, I won't stoop to their level.

I'll repay them with a brilliant play.

The game resumed.

Maybe because both teams were down a player, the ball moved around chaotically.

And after a brief scuffle, when the ball came to my feet, a play from a player I saw a few days ago on MyTube came to mind.

"Whoo..."

They called such a player a midfielder.

Shall I try to imitate him?
