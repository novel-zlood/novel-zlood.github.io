## 8. What can't he do? (1)

Two goals scored in an instant.

Park Minho and his friends' group chat quickly lit up with those two goals.

-MilanoLove: Uwaaaaaaa! This is it! This is it! AC Milan's Legend! Park Minho's multi-goooooooal!

-RealMilan: Hahaha, what legend of AC Milan? It's Inter's Emperor Park Minho's multi-goooooooal!

-KingWangJangJuve: No, it's Juventus's...

-MilanoLove: Shut up.

The chatroom quickly ignited.

All kinds of excited text fragments covered the chatroom.

-RealMilan: How dare you, the 7th place in the league, speak to the Milan brothers who are competing for 1st and 2nd place?

-MilanoLove: Oh... smells like trolling, hahaha.

-KingWangJangJuve: ...

-RealMilan: Are you mad? Sensitive? It's just a joke, why are you frowning?

They were sure that someday Park Minho would transfer to the club they truly support.

Of course, Roberto, who supports Parma, was different.

-Roberto: Who are you to talk about legends?

-Roberto: Minho still has 3 years left on his contract with Parma!

-Roberto: Everyone shut up! I want to be alone.

Even amidst the lively chatter.

When Park Minho got the ball, they quickly synced up again.

-Roberto: He's got it!

-MilanoLove: Minho! Minho! Park Minho!

-KingWangJangJuve: Ah! Santiago missed it;

-RealMilan: Why is he doing that ridiculous Marseille turn at such weird timings these days?

Like rabid fans of a top star.

They started fighting again.

Monica, taking a short break at work, glanced at the chatroom and chuckled.

-Monica: So, is Minho doing well?

Her question stirred up the chatroom once more.

Satisfied that Park Minho was doing well, she smiled contentedly and headed back to the camera for her modeling work.

[Parma's Rising Star! Park Minho. 2 goals and 1 assist in a stellar performance!]

[Parma! Defeats Perugia 4-1!]

[Minho ranked 3rd in league goals and 1st in assists! Leading the attack for Parma!]

[Coach Alain Levagne: 'Minho is a genius. Perugia was too easy for him.']

[Perugia furious at Coach Alain Levagne’s interview]

[Comments]

-Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho!

-Uwaaaaaa! The bomber from Korea is burning Perugia to ashes!

-Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!

-Tied for 3rd in league scoring with Gennaro Tatis... Plus, he's 1st in assists! We got an incredible player for free!

Simple performances matched with simple reactions.

It wasn’t just Parma’s fans who responded passionately to my performance.

Even some Korean overseas football fans who recognized my presence in the national team had a pretty good response.

I'm getting more and more famous.

And more and more attention will come, right?

"Aww...!"

"One more set."

So I have to work harder.

This lazy guy doesn't understand my pace and is just thinking about how to skip this training.

Someone might say, looking at me.

Can't you take it a bit slower?

I know.

I know I'm quite talented.

But the world is full of monsters with far more overwhelming talent than me.

They've played football much longer than I have.

They've trained more.

And even now, they spend more time than I do.

So how can I just sit back and rest?

"Aaaaaah! Minho! I'm gonna kill you!"

Well, this lazy guy curses me because he blames me for dragging him into this training hell.

This is all training that will become blood and flesh.

If you don’t like it, you should have scored in the last game.

"Minho! Seriously, I'm at my limit! My limit!"

"Member, you still have 3 sets left."

"F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!"

"Oh! Your Italian has improved a lot."

"F*cking training! F*cking teammate! F*cking Minho!"

Santiago.

Seeing that his Italian swearing has improved a lot, it seems he's finally properly adjusting to the team.

More importantly, I feel my stamina increasing.

To become a player who can show a variety of plays, not just simple ones like now.

"Let's do just one more set."

"......"

The lazy guy looked at me with resentful eyes.

Lazy guy! Didn't I tell you?

If you don’t like it, what should you do?

You should have scored in the last game.

[Serie B Round 7]

-Parma Calcio vs Ascoli

[Live Chat Comments]

-What's this? Why are they even broadcasting Serie B?

-Because Park Minho is doing well these days, they decided to broadcast Serie B too.

-They got the broadcasting rights for Serie A, and now it seems they got Serie B as well.

-Oh, it's starting!

September 27, 2021.

Serie B Round 7 match against Ascoli.

From before the match, the cheering songs of the Ascoli home fans could be heard in the away locker room.

But here, it's quite gentlemanly.

The away locker room is much more comfortable than elsewhere.

Of course, there are some psychological elements meant to make players uncomfortable...

But it's much better than being physically uncomfortable.

I heard from Leo that they bought the Serie B broadcasting rights in Korea.

Does that mean my parents or friends from my time living in Korea can watch my games?

That feeling is quite unique.

I must not make any mistakes today.

Well, there was another reason I must not make any mistakes today.

I took out my smartphone and glanced at sports articles on a Korean portal site, and one article caught my eye.

[South Korea National Team Coach Pedro! Travels to Italy to observe Park Minho!]

Our coach Pedro came to the stadium today to observe me.

Honestly, considering that South Korea's opponents this time were Syria and Iran, and both matches were away, it required thorough preparation more than any other match.

So I was curious.

Is there a reason to bring someone as uncertain as me?

There are many players much better than me.

"Well... everyone has their own reasons."

Honestly, if I get selected for the national team, that's great.

If not, it gives me some time to rest.

Some might look at me and ask, "Don't you have any patriotism?"

Sorry, but...

I was an ordinary person just two months ago.

I haven’t had the luxury to develop a national team identity, and I've been busy adjusting to the pros.

Moreover, unlike other players, I have no lingering attachment to the World Cup, Asian Cup, or Olympics.

If you ask why...

"Because I'm a King General Reserve."

The gratifying resonance of "re.serve."

It made me feel strangely good.

I think today's game will go well.

* * *

Boooooo!

At Ascoli's home stadium.

The boos from the home fans at Cino e Lillo Del Duca poured onto the field.

A small stadium accommodating only 12,000 people.

But their passion wouldn't lose to the nearly 100,000 home fans of Camp Nou who support Barcelona.

"Impressive."

Coach Pedro, watching Park Minho's movements starting on the right wing today, let out a short exclamation.

Having just made his debut for the national team a month ago, that player had already grown.

"I can see the growth."

It wasn't typical player growth.

It was an explosive growth.

He looked good enough to compete with other starting-level players on the wing.

Moreover, his playing time and activity levels were increasing significantly.

"The problem is that South Korea's attack line is already full."

There's no room.

South Korea's attack line, enjoying an unprecedented golden age, was evaluated to be on par with the glory days of 2002 at least.

Inserting Park Minho into such an attack line was still worrisome.

Experience was one thing.

He wasn’t sure if Minho had the ability to show the variety of plays he wanted.

That's why Coach Pedro planned to keep observing Park Minho until the final squad announcement.

Smack!

Boooooo!

Boos poured out again.

A simple play of cutting inside and curling a shot with his left foot, like Arjen Robben used to do.

With this simple yet destructive play, Park Minho scored the first goal and slid joyfully in front of the home fans.

It was a simple yet destructive play.

A play that couldn't be stopped even when known.

Coach Pedro burst into a hearty laugh.

"If Minho could also play as a box-to-box midfielder, I'd take him without any questions..."

Again, a mix of boos and cheers could be heard.

Park Minho had the ball again.

Coach Pedro, busily scribbling notes, fell into a happy dilemma about how to utilize Park Minho.

* * *

After scoring the first goal.

I was hit by a water bottle thrown by an Ascoli fan.

Thud! My head throbbed with the sound.

The game paused briefly.

A confrontation broke out between Ascoli's and our team's players.

Swoosh!

A rough tackle came in. But before that, I sent a low and fast cross with the outside front of my foot.

I saw Gennaro Tatis bring his head to my cross.

But the opposing goalkeeper, Nicola Leali, made a fantastic save and snatched away my assist.

-Nicola Leali's fantastic save!

-It was dangerous! If they conceded another goal while trailing 1-0, the momentum would have completely shifted.

The players' play became rougher.

It seemed like they were becoming irritable because I got hit by the water bottle.

To be honest, I would have been somewhat angry if Lazy Guy had been hit by the bottle.

Throwing something onto the field.

It's certainly bad manners.

The problem is that this confrontation leads to rough play, causing injuries.

Like Franco, who was now lying on the field.

Two red cards were issued.

One for Ascoli's central defender, Mattia Viti, who tackled Franco from behind.

The other for Santiago, who ran at Mattia in anger after seeing Franco.

The field was in chaos.

Boos and trash rained down onto the field.

It was really the worst.

That’s when the coach urgently called me.

"Minho! Minho!"

I quickly ran to the coach.

The coach told me to play in the center.

"So... as a box-to-box midfielder?"

"Yes, there's no one who can play centrally. With both teams down to nine players, there's no reason to stick to the central attacking midfield."

"Box-to-box midfielder..."

"Don't worry! Just focus on linking the ball forward from slightly behind. Leave the rest to Marjan! Hey! Jan! Take Minho's position!"

After explaining everything to me, the coach quickly substituted Jan Karamoh for Franco and placed him on the right wing.

And Gennaro Tatis was moved to the left wing.

The second substitution was Gianluca brought in for Glauco and placed upfront.

The game resumed.

Marjan Kurtić, my partner, approached me.

"Minho, if your pass gets blocked, just send it long to the flanks. If you can't find the angle, connect it to me."

He seemed worried about me.

Honestly, I was worried too since it was my first time playing this position.

But I couldn't just sit back.

They injured Franco, who taught me a lot, so I had to pay them back properly.

Of course, I wasn't going to stoop to their level.

I would repay them with a stylish play.

The game resumed.

Maybe because both teams were down a player, the ball moved around chaotically.

And after a brief skirmish, as the ball came to my feet, a play by a certain player I saw on MeTube a few days ago flashed in my mind.

"Hoo..."

They called such a player a midfield striker.

Should I give it a try?
