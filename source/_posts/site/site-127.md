## 48. 4senal (1)

I can feel the season coming to an end.

As we entered April, I could see people's expectations inflate like a balloon.

"Minho! What should I buy to make a good impression in celebration of Arsenal's unbeaten season?"

Monika was buying my worn jerseys at random from auction sites. I thought she could just ask me to bring one for her.

"We're still missing the jersey you wore in the first half of the League Cup final and the one you swapped with Juan Zapata in the Europa League Group F match against Lazio."

"I need these to complete my collection."

Sometimes, Monika scares me.

At the same time, I wondered how she could afford to spend so much money collecting my jerseys just with her modeling job.

"What? You think I don't have enough money?"

Monika manipulated her smartphone with a look that said, 'What on earth do you mean by that?'

And the screen she held up to me showed an enormous amount of money.

I heard that her grandfather is the owner of a famous Italian distribution company.

Moreover, she was preparing to inherit that company while working as a model and learning its operations.

Honestly, I was a bit taken aback.

Monika's words, "Minho, you have a lot of money too, right?" brought me back to my senses.

Somehow... I can't believe my pterodactyl-sounding girlfriend is rich.

Anyway.

Contrary to Monika's expectations, Arsenal continues to be in a precarious situation.

There are even rumors that Arsenal's medical team is incompetent because players keep getting injured.

Of course, compared to Parma, Arsenal had amazing facilities and excellent staff.

"Lorenzo Lufo, who I met at the training ground, spit out a story about Arsenal's curse while saying, "I'm telling you, the number 4 and Arsenal are definitely connected by something bad."

It seems that he believes this superstition even more because he experienced Arsenal in April last season.

Honestly, I'm skeptical.

But... when I see players suddenly suffering frequent injuries starting in April, I start to think differently.

What on earth is the number '4' to Arsenal?

I don't know anymore.

* * *

Some injured players have returned.

But the coach gave everyone except for captain Tyrone Tierney a rest.

Why can't Tyrone Tierney rest?

Looking at how the left flank was thoroughly exploited in the match against West Ham without Tyrone Tierney, it's inevitable.

Even I think it was severely exploited.

Casper Nielsen is by no means a lacking player, but he is still a young player who needs more growth.

In the match held at our home ground.

Southampton confidently pushed up their line against our 1.5 team and returned with a satisfied expression after achieving the result they aimed for.

[Arsenal! A narrow draw with Southampton!]

[Minho's last-second goal! Preventing Arsenal's defeat and continuing the unbeaten streak!]

[Tyler Smith Rowe carried off the field in the 34th minute! Arsenal continues to have injured players!]

[A brutal April! A wave of injuries hits Arsenal!]

A disappointing result.

It was a game we could have won.

I felt that Southampton had prepared well.

Well... Southampton is currently hanging in 5th place in the league, so they have no choice but to risk everything.

There's only a 3-point difference with 4th place Manchester City.

Still, it's fortunate that we maintained our unbeaten streak.

As soon as injured players returned, another player left the field due to injury.

"At this rate, it really is a curse."

"I think the reason we drew this match is that Southampton is in 5th place. If we had faced 4th place Manchester City... we would have definitely lost."

"Soon... it's the FA Cup semi-finals... We won't lose to Man United in that match, right?"

I could hear Gooners murmuring.

They also showed anxiety about Arsenal's strange trend as we entered April.

Even though I worked hard to relieve their anxiety, somewhere an injury would occur, stuffing Gooners' hearts with anxiety again.

In Korea, they call this 'eokkka'.

I wonder if there is a similar term in England.

I'm a bit curious.

[Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final opponent is Man United!]

[Can Man United defeat Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-finals and seize their only remaining chance for a trophy this year?]

[The Champions League semi-finalists are Liverpool, Man City, Real Madrid, and Leverkusen!]

[Arsenal! Achieves a 3-0 victory against West Ham in the second leg of the Europa League quarter-finals!]

The second leg of the Europa League quarter-finals passed without incident.

Honestly, if someone had gotten injured in this match too... I would have seriously believed in superstitions.

So as mid-April passed and April 21st arrived.

We headed to Wembley for the FA Cup semi-finals.

Our opponents were Man United, with Junseo hyung and Ronaldo.

Having been eliminated in the Champions League quarter-finals by Leverkusen, Man United's only remaining hope for a trophy this season was this FA Cup.

I asked Junseo hyung about it over the phone.

Man United is determined to win this FA Cup, to the extent that they are putting everything on the line.

"Ronaldo is very determined."

Hearing this made me a bit excited too.

Will Ronaldo be able to lift a trophy in his final years?

It's up to our Arsenal to decide that.

More than that, I feel a bit sorry for Junseo hyung.

He came to Man United for the chance to win a trophy.

Unfortunately, their performance this season has been less than stellar.

Of course, if he had stayed at Tottenham, he would have had to fight for relegation, so... I think moving to Man United might not have been a bad decision.

[Ronaldo: 'I'm a superstar. Please don't compare me to rising stars.']

However... this man's mouth is impressive even in his final years.

I'm curious about how much more he will talk like a nagging mother-in-law after retirement.

* * *

Wembley Stadium was packed with spectators.

The FA Cup semi-final between Arsenal and Man United.

Many fans gathered to watch this single-elimination match.

Man United, hoping to achieve a beautiful end to Ronaldo's final season by lifting the FA Cup trophy, and Arsenal, aiming to record a mini treble by also winning the FA Cup, faced each other.

With some players returning from injury, Arsenal had regained momentum, while Man United, with Junseo hyung and Ronaldo, had regained form and improved their performance since March.

Many football fans showed interest in the match between the two teams.

The various storylines intertwined, increasing the interest even more.

[Minho vs Ronaldo! The battle of the best strikers in the EPL!]

[Can Ronaldo claim victory against Minho?]

[Despite all the trouble he causes, the reason Man United can't let go of Ronaldo is because of his title as the league's second top scorer!]

Especially since the match featured the two players who have been the top two scorers from the first half of the season until now, there was even more interest.

Moreover, Arsenal was quite serious about this FA Cup.

Even if it wasn't as significant as the league or the Europa League, winning the FA Cup would mean achieving the incredible feat of lifting four trophies in a single season.

"I'm sad there's no term like 'mini quadruple.'"

"Then we'll just have to win the Champions League next season and achieve a treble."

At my words, Lorenzo quietly nodded, saying, "Is that so?"

With captain Tyrone Tierney back, the locker room atmosphere was much brighter than usual.

As we entered the tunnel, Man United players were already lined up, waiting to enter.

Junseo hyung greeted me with a big smile as I stood next to him.

And a bit further away, Ronaldo, with his usual sullen expression, glared at me.

If only he were a bit more mature...

Ronaldo, who would be praised as a truly great player, why does he have such a childish mindset?

Of course, that childlike innocence might have positively contributed to his incredible records and achievements, but I predict that Ronaldo will be much more underrated than Messi after retirement because of that personality.

"Lorenzo... don't be like that."

"What?"

"Nevermind."

Lorenzo made a sulky face.

The guy who was so happy when I transferred now doesn't appreciate my value because Arsenal's performance is good.

"Ah... I just want to rest for one month due to injury."

"Nope! Minho... don't say such negative things. Didn't you see the goosebumps on my arm just now?"

I have to threaten him like this for him to realize my value.

Leaving behind the startled Lorenzo, the players of both teams entered the field.

Seeing Wembley Stadium again.

Having come here often, it feels a bit familiar.

"I don't feel good today."

"Why all of a sudden?"

"Looking at today's referee... I think the game will be rough."

Tyrone Tierney, looking anxiously at today's referee, puzzled me.

What's wrong with that referee?

What's the problem?

* * *

- RealMilan: We're screwed! Of all people, the referee is Luke Ellington.

- LoveMilan: Are you watching the FA Cup semi-final too?

- RealMilan: Man United's key playmaker Arsen Zakarian will be a free agent at the end of this season.

- KingJuventus: That guy... he has a Juventus style.

- RealMilan: Screw you.

- Roberto: So what's the problem with that referee?

- RealMilan: That referee is famous lately. His decisions are all over the place, and he doesn't react much to rough physical play.

Park Minho's group chat was also buzzing.

The FA Cup semi-final was such a match that it naturally drew the attention of football fans.

- Monika: Ah... of all people, it's Luke Ellington;

- Roberto: Seeing a genuine Gunner reacting like that... He must be a really terrible referee.

- RealMilan: Mr. Park Minho! I earnestly pray that you don't get hurt and transfer to Inter.

- Monika: Our Minho is staying with Arsenal for life.

- LoveMilan: Honestly, I think Minho should be treated as public property. Arsenal should use him for just three years and then send him back to Serie A. That's fair.

- Monika: Are you guys crazy?

Just as the group chat was being flooded with messages about today's referee, the match began.

Everyone's expectation was, of course, for an Arsenal victory.

Recent form was good, and even though some players were out injured, Arsenal's squad was quite solid.

Moreover, the left flank, which had been identified as a weakness in the West Ham match, was patched up with the return of Tyrone Tierney.

Many believed that Man United would not easily break through Arsenal's defense.

In that situation, about 4 minutes into the first half, an incident occurred.

During a ball contest, a rough physical battle ensued.

Ronaldo and Tyrone Tierney were vying for the ball when they both fell to the ground, screaming.

No referee, no matter how lenient, would ignore a scene where an elbow was used in mid-air.

Ronaldo collected a yellow card just 4 minutes into the first half.

The problem was Tyrone Tierney.

He was rolling on the field, clutching his ankle, even though he was initially holding his head.

Arsenal's medical team quickly rushed out.

After examining Tyrone Tierney's ankle, they signaled for a substitution to the bench.

It turned out that he had landed badly on his foot.

Naturally, the Gooners booed and cursed Ronaldo.

Fortunately, it didn't seem like a major injury as Tyrone Tierney managed to get up and walk off the field with assistance.

At the same time, Arsenal's bench was bustling.

The problem was that there was no player on Arsenal's bench to play the left flank.

Backup Casper Nielsen couldn't even sit on the bench for this match due to exhaustion.

As a result, coach Alain Levagne decided to put in Bhutanese winger Saka, who had some experience playing as a wing-back early in his career.

"In attack, it's a 3-4-3 formation! Plan B! Got it?"

He then switched to a modified three-back formation, using Bhutanese winger Saka as a winger since he had little defensive influence.

With the game restarting, Lorenzo Lufo muttered to himself.

"See... there's definitely something about the number 4 for Arsenal."
