## The God of Parma (2)

- The game ends! The winner of the 21-22 Coppa Italia is Parma Calcio 1913!
- Parma, who once sold all their trophies, not only won the league undefeated but also defeated AC Milan, a prestigious Serie A team, in the Coppa Italia to become champions!
- Parma! This is a miracle! Truly a miracle!

As soon as the referee blew the whistle to end the game, Parma's fans rushed onto the field to embrace the players.

Winning the league undefeated was already exhilarating, and now, with their return to Serie A, they had also secured the Coppa Italia title and a spot in the Europa League.

There was no reason not to adore them.

Especially popular among the fans was Park Minho, who scored a hat-trick in today's game and netted the most goals (11) in the 21-22 Coppa Italia season.

"Minhooooooo!"
"The God of Parma said he won't leave! He will stay with us for one more year!"
"Park Mi-no!"
"Park Mi-no! Park Mi-no! There is a god living in Parma! Park Mi-no!"

Even though they conceded 4 goals today, there was an old man hugging Giovanni Buffon, who made crucial saves at key moments, and crying. 

Others were tossing Santiago, who had vigorously attacked the opponent's flanks, into the air.

Even 20 minutes after the game ended, the fans' invasion of the field did not subside, and they were barely able to leave the field.

Then began the award ceremony.

Medals were hung around the players' necks one by one.

Giovanni Buffon, who brought the trophy, looked around at the players and slowly raised his arm.

As Giovanni lifted the trophy high, paper confetti burst with a "pop!"

The Parma fans continued to roar with immense cheers, showing no signs of tiring.

- Yes! The winner of the 21-22 Coppa Italia is Parma Calcio 1913!

With the commentators' final words, Parma's 21-22 season came to an end.

* * *

[Park Minho promises 'one more year' with Parma! Re-signing announced right after the game!]

[Park Minho's contract is for 3 years with the highest salary clause and a buyout clause of 52 million euros!]

[Even with a 52 million euro (approximately 70 billion won) price tag, Park Minho continues to attract interest from many big clubs!]

[Park Minho, 'How could I leave after just one season when Parma calls me a god?']

[A Parma fan fainted from excitement over Park Minho's performance! Fortunately, there are no major health issues!]

- Ju-moooooo!
- This is incredible, haha!
- Wow, 54 goals and 37 assists in 45 games this season... Is this real?
- No wonder Parma fans call him a god, haha. With interviews like that, isn't it thrilling?
- Seriously... This is insane. A hat-trick in the final?

In Korea, the news of Parma's Coppa Italia victory and Park Minho's performance was also widely reported.

As a result, the reactions were overwhelmingly positive.

Though not as much as in Parma, of course.

[Title: Why Parma is Going Crazy]

  - A team that won the Europa League twice in the late 90s went bankrupt and sold all their trophies.
  - Then, suddenly, a fan who stormed the pitch during a friendly match started scoring goals, leading the team to an undefeated league win and a Coppa Italia victory?
  - And scored decisive goals in several crucial matches?
  - There’s no reason not to call him a god, haha.
  - Scored 43 goals and provided 32 assists in the league to secure promotion, and scored 11 goals and provided 5 assists in the Coppa Italia to win it... Why wouldn’t you call him a god?
  - Hey! They say Park Minho has a girlfriend? (link)
  - What? What? What?
  - Minho hyung? Who is this girl?
  - Hyung, do you want to see me go crazy?
  - Wow... This is insane. What does she do?
  - She’s Monica Argento, an Italian model who became famous for her 'selfish body' in women’s communities.
  - Hyung? Why are you the only one happy?
  - Park Minho is so undeserving... Damn, he should just vanish!

Noisy media.

The Parma squad couldn’t regain their composure.

There was even talk of preparing for a parade when they returned to Parma in two days.

They even appeared on Parma’s local broadcast.

However, not all news was good.

Giovanni Buffon, who hoped to be included in the 2022 World Cup squad, announced his retirement.

[Giovanni Buffon! Honorable Retirement of a Legend!]

[Buffon retires after lifting the trophy at the place where he started his football career!]

[Giovanni Buffon, 'I wanted the 2022 World Cup... But I felt it was too difficult. Still, I am happy to end my career where I started, at Parma.']

Buffon wasn’t the only one to retire.

Franco Vázquez also announced his retirement soon after, citing frequent knee injuries.

With the departure of two key veterans, Parma urgently began preparing for the transfer market.

They kept Park Minho.

They were renewing contracts with key players.

What Parma needed now was new signings.

* * *

After finishing the re-signing process.

I headed to the US to meet the physical trainer and instructor introduced by Leo.

I wanted to go straight to Korea, but I couldn’t rest properly because I promised the Parma fans.

Still, being called a god, how could I not prepare for the next season?

Anyway.

Before Buffon and Franco retired, I had a simple meal with them and other departing players before coming to the US.

Parma was still buzzing with talks about me.

Ah, in a good way.

And rightly so.

This season.

My personal performance was the best.

Of course, the team’s achievements were also the best.

I recorded 54 goals and 37 assists in 45 games this season.

As a team, Parma achieved an undefeated league win and a Coppa Italia victory, securing a double.

Thanks to this, Serie B teams seemed to dislike me, but I didn’t care much.

After all, we got promoted.

Oh, and Ascoli, who cursed me like they wanted to kill me, got eliminated by Benevento in the playoffs.

Honestly, it was quite satisfying.

I wanted to offer some insincere condolences to some Ascoli fans who made racist remarks towards me.

Even though my market value rose to 52 million euros, Leo said the interest in me didn’t stop.

Honestly, I still can’t believe it.

That my market value is around 70 billion won.

I was amazed that it was even higher than the price of a house in Gangnam.

Ah, as my market value increased, Juventus fans, on the other hand, were heavily criticized.

Despite attending the tryouts to check me out directly.

I heard they faced a lot of backlash for not signing Park Minho.

Moreover, Juventus suffered the humiliation of finishing 3rd in the league and getting eliminated in the Round of 16 in the Champions League this season.

The criticism will probably intensify.

Anyway.

The media focused on Parma’s remarkable performance, highlighting the contributions of young players.

With performances from players under 26 like me, Kenneth, Santiago, Lautaro, and Gennaro, it was clear why they were interested in Parma’s young talents.

At the same time, such interest often led to transfers.

[Chelsea and Newcastle offer 17 million euros to Lautaro Valenti!]

[Transfer almost certain! Lautaro’s choice?]

[Parma losing key defender! Who will fill Lautaro Valenti’s void?]

When I called the prince syndrome patient, he told me he was most attracted to Newcastle.

I heard they offered a huge sum.

Apparently, it was twice the weekly salary I received under Parma’s highest salary clause.

For a moment, I wondered if I should have transferred too, but the sight of Parma fans in the Coppa Italia final lingered in my mind, making it impossible to leave.

- Monica: Lorenzo Lupo! Lifelong Arsenal! Best. Arsenal. Ever! Next season is ours!

The 2-meter giant from Pisa.

Lorenzo Lupo left for Arsenal.

Before leaving, he texted me, "You must come to the EPL too!" and then headed to London.

He seemed even more persistent than Monica.

Monica seemed like an angel compared to him.

Such an obsessive attachment, scarier than a toxic Gooner.

Monica seemed to have high expectations for Lorenzo Lupo, who scored 32 goals this season for Pisa.

She was very excited, claiming they brought a monster striker who saved the team from relegation.

However, Arsenal finished 5th in the league this season, got eliminated in the League Cup semi-finals, and were runners-up in the FA Cup, so it’s hard to expect much next season.

Still, if Monica is happy...

That’s all that matters.

- MilanoLove: Hehe... King God Emperor Professor Park Minho... What kind of car do you want?
- RealMilan: Lucky bastard.
- KingWangJangJuve: We should’ve made him buy a real sports car to teach him a lesson... But our Professor Park Minho is too kind-hearted, so he settled for a car model! Annoying!

My stockbroker seemed half-crazy after seeing AC Milan finish as runners-up in both the Coppa Italia and the league by just 3 points.

So I felt a bit sorry and let it slide.

- Roberto: Hey-yo! Professor? Do not call a god by a mortal’s title!

Oh, Roberto was even crazier.

These days, he seemed to see me as a saint or a holy person.

I mean, what’s so special about winning the Coppa Italia?

I don’t get it.

But if they like it, it’s OK.

* * *

"Minho! Long time no see!"

A handsome Italian man smiled in front of me.

Yes, it's my agent, Leo.

Leo, who met me at Miami Airport, put me in his car and took me somewhere.

"This season was truly amazing."

"I was lucky."

"Haha! If that was luck, then every player in the world must have the worst luck?"

"Hmm... Is that so?"

"Minho, you are now the god of Parma. It wouldn’t be strange to call you that given your performance."

Leo told me to have confidence.

But honestly, it’s a bit scary, isn’t it?

What if we fail miserably next season?

Of course, that won't happen.

But still, I need to be thoroughly prepared.

"Minho, you underestimate yourself."

"Do I?"

Leo nodded vigorously.

"Yes, when you said you would stay at Parma for one more year... Honestly, I was quite disappointed."

"Because I believe Minho can play for a much bigger club and receive better treatment than at Parma."

"So, don’t worry too much about next season. You are an excellent player, and a few days of rest won’t diminish your skills."

With Leo saying this, I should probably take it easy.

"Oh, by the way, I have someone to introduce to you."

"An introduction?"

"Yes, not an instructor... A friend of mine who wants to meet you."

Someone wants to meet me?

Who could it be? I was really curious.

But that question was soon answered.

Arriving at a large stadium near Miami Airport, I looked around the stadium in a daze.

"This place..."

"Yes, this is DRV PNK Stadium, home of Inter Miami CF."

"Then the person I’m meeting?"

"Yes, someone related to this club."

The first person that came to mind was the club owner, David Beckham.

He played for Manchester United and Real Madrid, and I still remember him from a phone commercial in Korea, saying "I want both!"

"Oh, it’s not Beckham."

Then who could it be?

My question was soon answered.

It was a player I had seen many times in YouTube videos.

Though he had gained some weight compared to the past.

Still, his excellent goal-scoring ability and his knack for creating 1-on-1 chances by cleverly avoiding offside traps were unmatched.

A great striker who scored 240 goals in the 2010s playing for top clubs like Real Madrid, Napoli, and Juventus.

"Nice to meet you. I’m Gonzalo Higuaín."

Gonzalo Higuaín stood before me.
