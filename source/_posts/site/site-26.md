## 11. Step Up? Level Up! (1)

Ternana had prepared extensively.

In order to win this match.

Their fourth place position in the league.

With just a few more victories, they could challenge for second place, which would secure promotion.

That's why they poured everything into this match.

They analyzed not only Benevento, who are second in the league, but also Brescia, who are third.

Thanks to this, most of the analysis team was on the brink of exhaustion, but they managed to catch up in points by defeating Benevento before the match against Parma.

And now, facing Parma Calcio.

A team dreaming of an undefeated league season.

They are almost certain to be promoted to Serie A.

The only question is whether they will remain undefeated in Serie B.

They were on the verge of breaking them.

"They are not invincible."

Ternana's coach Cristiano looked sharply at the field, stroking his chin.

It was past the 35th minute of the second half.

The score was 2-1, with Ternana narrowly leading.

"I was surprised. I didn't expect him to break through the defense by himself and sprint 20 meters to score a goal..."

"We have to acknowledge it. Minho is a player with such exceptional talent that he doesn't belong in Serie B."

In the first round of the Coppa Italia, they didn't realize this and suffered a humiliating defeat.

But this time would be different.

They had prepared extensively.

In attack, they exploited the weaknesses in Parma's defense to score the first two goals.

In defense, they isolated Park Minho and Franco, making it difficult to penetrate the center of Ternana's defense without individual skill.

"It's really fortunate for us that Gennaro Tutis is injured."

"That's right. Even if Minho or another second-line player sends in a good cross, Gianluca can't perfectly intercept it."

Gianluca Inglese, who used to be strong in aerial duels, was no longer the same.

It couldn't be helped.

His age, coupled with a knee injury, meant he wasn't as good as he used to be.

"But we can't just leave it at that."

So they assigned a marker.

A defender over 190cm tall.

Time was running out.

Parma was getting desperate.

Now there were only 10 minutes, no, 9 minutes left in regular time.

With added time, they only needed to hold on for about 13 more minutes for Ternana to claim victory.

"Breaking their unbeaten streak and advancing to third place in the league with this crucial win."

Cristiano's eyes gleamed.

With this victory, the team that would leap forward would be none other than Ternana.

Time was ticking away.

Then.

The ball connected to Park Minho's feet again, and Parma's counterattack began.

* * *

Football is a team sport.

Therefore, an individual's ability to change the game is limited.

Overreaching can have negative effects on the entire team because of one player.

Well, if it were Messi, he might have the ability to change the game single-handedly.

But I'm not Messi.

To say I should play like Messi.

I can definitely say it's impossible.

My strengths and Messi's strengths are different.

Honestly speaking, it's a bit frustrating.

A surprise play like earlier isn't very effective, and I couldn't think of a clear method.

If I were a dribbler with immense skill and creativity like Ronaldinho, it might have been different.

But I couldn't fully replicate his play.

I couldn't understand the reasoning behind his moves in various situations.

I could roughly see the intentions of other players.

But not Ronaldinho.

So I couldn't replicate it.

I stopped watching Ronaldinho's videos on MyTube after just one viewing.

It wasn't like Arjen Robben's play, where you know but can't stop it.

It was genuinely unpredictable play that you couldn't stop because you didn't know.

That couldn't be replicated.

So how should I play the game?

Who would be the best example of a game-changer that I could emulate?

I thought deeply and deeply again.

And I made a decision.

For now, let's utilize my teammates.

The moment I made that decision.

The ball connected to my feet again.

Unlike usual, this time I didn't dribble the ball directly but passed it to Franco.

The Ternana players, who were used to my on-the-ball style, looked slightly surprised.

They must have remembered that I had tried to beat at least one player every time I had the ball during the match.

But no matter how I thought about it, my ability was a bit lacking to play like a game-changer.

My stamina wasn't fully developed either.

So I had to utilize my teammates.

Yes, like this.

-The ball is connected to Franco.

-For the first time today, Minho passes the ball to Franco and penetrates deeply into the center.

-The ball switches to Gianluca on the flank.

-Gianluca! He advances slowly while keeping the ball. But there are two players blocking him.

Ternana is defending Gianluca with cooperative defense.

But since two players are involved.

A space opens up, and I raise my hand and move into that gap.

-The ball is connected to Minho again.

-Minho receives the ball in the half-space! It's a bit far, but... With Minho's ability, it's possible to shoot from here!

As soon as I received the ball in this position, Ternana's defense moved to block the pass and shot.

Especially knowing my ability to curve the shot, I noticed that a defender was positioned there.

Seeing three defenders move to block me, I honestly felt a bit impressed.

I've already become a player like this.

That's the kind of admiration I felt.

But I couldn't just admire it.

Recalling a scene that came to mind, this time I dribbled directly into the danger area.

-Minho! This time he's breaking through directly!

-The space is narrow! It's a bit reckless!

It looked like I was entering a narrow space on my own.

Some football fans might be thinking, 'Finally, he's become greedy!'

But I can say for sure.

I have a plan.

Tap! Tap! Tap!

Three touches.

And the ball never touched the ground.

I kept lifting the ball with my instep like juggling, pushing aside Ternana's defenders and moving deeper.

Ah, if Monica saw this, she would be thrilled.

Because I'm briefly showing that juggling dribble Thierry Henry once displayed.

-Minho! Minho! Minho! He's dribbling with juggling and penetrating deep into the penalty area!

-It feels like we're watching Thierry Henry! Incredible! Minho effortlessly beats one player!

Five more touches followed.

And two more juggles in between.

Now all that was left was the shot.

But I couldn't score.

"Aaaah!"

Ternana's defender, who I was pushing away, eventually pushed me down.

The problem was that the defender's outstretched left foot hit my foot instead of the ball.

Piiiii!

Yes, this is a penalty kick.

-Uwaaaah! Penalty! Minho earns a penalty kick in the 42nd minute of the second half, creating a chance to equalize!

-This is it! This is it! When Parma was in danger, Minho created this opportunity! He's an amazing player!

Boo! Boo!

The Libero Liberati, Ternana's home stadium, was buried in huge boos.

I didn't want to see the Ternana defender urging me to get up, so I covered my face with both hands.

I didn't want them to see me smiling.

After lying down for about 30 seconds, Franco, who had a satisfied smile, extended his hand.

"Nice play."

I grabbed his hand and stood up.

"Franco, you take this PK."

"Are you sure?"

"I used up a lot of energy, so my legs are shaking."

Franco nodded at my excuse.

Honestly, I'm not very confident in taking PKs.

That's why I conceded.

Praying as I watched Franco stand in front of the ball.

If he misses this, I'll put 20 bugs in his socks tomorrow.

Fortunately, Franco seemed to hear my prayer and cleanly converted the PK, making it 2-2.

"Uwaaah! Good job! Good job!"

"Minhooo!"

"Parc Minho! Parc Minho!"

Our fans were chanting my name in joy more than Franco, who scored the PK.

Seeing them follow us to the away game, they must really love Parma.

Now the score is 2-2.

There are 2 minutes left.

Including added time, there are about 5 minutes left.

But humans are greedy. If you score one goal, you want to score two.

If you score two, you want to score three.

Ending it at 2-2 feels a bit regretful.

"Let's score one more."

* * *

"What are you doing? Focus! Focus!"

The technical zone of Ternana was in chaos.

Ternana's coach Cristiano, who was furious when it became 2-2, roared like a beast, harshly criticizing the Ternana defense.

"Block the ball from getting to Minho! Why aren't you blocking that position? It's a play you can block if you know it, right? Focus!"

Coach Alain Lavagne didn't agree with the opposing coach.

A play you can block if you know it?

No, that's a play you can't block even if you know it.

And the move Minho just showed is something the Ternana defense hadn't seen before.

"What? You're offering 9 million euros (about 12.1 billion won) for Minho's transfer fee?"

Ridiculous.

Trying to acquire a player like that for just 9 million euros is an insult.

"You can't even buy Minho's toenail for 9 million euros."

"I agree."

Assistant coach Matteo also acknowledged it.

A player like that for just 9 million euros?

The standards of big clubs these days are worse than gangsters.

"He was just like Thierry Henry! Just now! Seeing that play and saying what? Because he lacks experience and it might be a fluke, the maximum transfer fee is 9 million euros?"

Go home and eat the food your mom gives you.

And go get spanked by your dad three more times.

The even more surprising thing is that Park Minho, through analyzing videos of various players, is gradually adapting their play to his own style.

"Minho lacks creativity and adaptability?"

Of course, compared to world-class players, he's a bit lacking.

Coach Alain Lavagne shook his head.

But to show moves like that.

Basic creativity was essential.

Moreover, he seemed to have quite a bit of adaptability.

But why did these aspects seem like significant weaknesses when he first saw Park Minho?

"I don't understand."

Yes, he couldn't understand.

Of course, it's only been a few months.

But the Park Minho of now was different from the past.

Someone had locked a tight padlock.

Today, that padlock seemed to have been unlocked.

The problem was he didn't know how it was unlocked.

And who had locked it in the past.

It wasn't a mental issue either.

Thinking about Park Minho's usual behavior, that didn't seem to be the case.

Waaaah!

The away section roared.

With one minute left in added time, Park Minho had finally scored a buzzer-beater.

Seeing that, Coach Alain Lavagne jumped up.

And he forgot about the dilemma he had just been pondering, becoming an animal that only screamed wildly.

"Uwaaaaaah!"

"Parc Minho! Minho! Minho! Parc Minho!"

"Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!"

The away section was in chaos.

Conversely, the Ternana players hung their heads low.

Shortly after, the game resumed.

But after a couple of lackluster exchanges.

The referee blew the final whistle to end the match.

Piiik! Piiik! Piiik!

* * *

The buzzer-beater went in easier than expected.

Just... I took a shot from a distance.

And it went in with a whoosh.

Honestly, this goal felt too anticlimactic.

There wasn't any overwhelming feeling.

Anyway.

Soon after, the referee blew the final whistle to end the match.

"Uwaah! We won! We won!"

"Another close comeback victory!"

"Minho! I love you!"

"Minho! Minho! Parc Minho!"

After greeting the fans who followed us to the away game and swapping jerseys with the Ternana players, I entered the locker room.

Coach Alain Lavagne had a stern expression.

Yes, I was back to reality now.

On the surface, it seemed like a sweet result of a 3-2 victory.

But in reality, the situation was a mess.

Knowing this, the veterans voluntarily told the younger players to be quiet and sit down.

All eyes were on Coach Alain Lavagne.

Finally, the coach spoke.

"First, I apologize."

The coach bowed his head deeply.

After about three seconds, the younger players seemed to sense something was wrong and looked visibly flustered.

The coach continued, raising his head.

"I was too complacent, confident of victory. Preparing for the third round of the Coppa Italia against AS Roma, I became arrogant. I thought the remaining league matches would be easy."

"So I neglected the analysis of the recent league matches. To beat AS Roma, I didn't even want to waste time on the league."

But that was arrogance.

In today's match against Ternana, they were trailing until over the 20th minute of the second half.

The coach knew this too.

They had been too complacent.

There's a famous line from a movie.

-You guys only live for tomorrow? Those who live only for tomorrow die to those who live for today.

-What are you saying, you idiot...

Ah, cancel the second line.

Just read the first one.

Anyway, the coach was saying this.

He only looked at tomorrow too much.

He should have looked at today too.

And then gradually looked at the next.

"We will never respond as poorly as we did today in the next match."

"I promise. If we show such a performance again, I will voluntarily resign."

Afterward, nothing special happened.

After giving feedback on today's match, the coach quietly left the locker room.

But the players' expressions were different.

Even without the veterans setting the mood.

The players' eyes had changed a lot.

After facing the crisis called Ternana.

Parma seemed to regain their unbeaten form.

[Park Minho! Second Buzzer Beater Goal of the Season!]

(Serie B Round 17)

-Parma Calcio 3:2 Ternana

MVP: Park Minho (70, 90+2)

After the match against Ternana, we showed overwhelming performances in the following two matches, continuing our winning streak.

[Parc Minho! 1 Goal and 3 Assists! Dominating the Match with a Fantastic Performance!]

(Serie B Round 18)

-Parma Calcio 5:1 Cittadella

MVP: Park Minho (75)

For the first time in a while, I recorded a hat-trick of assists.

[Goal Explosion in the Second Round of the Coppa Italia! Parma Calcio Scores 6 Goals for the Win!]

(Coppa Italia Second Round)

-Parma Calcio 6:3 Ascoli

MVP: Gennaro Tutis (33, 44, 71)

In this match, I recorded a 20-20 season.

After the match, Leo called me and said, "Minho! Congratulations! Is there any gift you want?"

I replied that I would receive it after achieving 40-40.

Honestly, it was a bit of a boastful statement.

Leo was ecstatic after hearing my words.

Before hanging up, he said, "Minho! I'm so happy to be your agent."

Anyway.

The crisis passed, and the team became more solid.

Now, only the last match in December remains.

After this match, we have a break until mid-January.

But I don't think I can rest during this break.

-Coach José Matinho, what do you think about Parma's Parc Minho, your opponent in the third round of the Coppa Italia?

-Who is Minho? I don't know such a player. What? A rising star from South Korea?

-Star is a term fitting for the god of Tottenham.

-It is not a term fitting for a mere Serie B player.

To give that 'Special One' a taste of his own medicine...

I need to think about what kind of training to do during this break.

I need to ponder this carefully.
