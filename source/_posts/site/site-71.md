## 25. League Resumption (2)

[Parma wins the last match of 2022!]

[Park Minho! Stellar performance with 1 goal and 1 assist! The World Cup star is indeed on a different level!]

[Parma just 5 points behind the second-place Inter! Is Parma creating a fairytale like Leicester City?]

[The Ballon d'Or winner announced later due to the 2022 Qatar World Cup is Thierry Mbappe!]

They ended 2022 smoothly.

The Ballon d'Or winner, announced later due to the World Cup, was Thierry Mbappe.

January 1, 2023.

As soon as the transfer market opened, clubs were drooling over Parma, and contacts poured in.

[Simon Soph! Gaining interest from Monaco and Leeds!]

[Interest pouring in for Santiago Brunetta! Dortmund, Sevilla, and Liverpool targeting him?]

[Fabio Cucciola! Wanted by Fiorentina!]

It was a dominant first half of the season.

Of course, only 14 rounds had passed.

Parma's squad showed they could compete in Serie A, as demonstrated in the match against Napoli.

Conversely, there were hardly any rumors about Park Minho.

Of course, there was some contact.

Many clubs were continuously talking with Park Minho's agent, Leo Carpentieri.

Anyway.

Amid ongoing transfer talks, Parma quickly tightened internal control.

They extended contracts with young players to keep as many as possible.

They quickly sent off players who needed to leave and hastened to recruit replacements.

Parma, usually known for being inefficient, moved surprisingly quickly this winter.

Some Parma fans watched quietly, wondering if the sun was rising in the west.

[Parma signs young Swedish midfielder Joshua Feizoff for 12 million euros!]

[Simon Soph! Almost confirmed to be loaned to Monaco?]

[Coach Alain Lavagne, who prefers signing young players! Is he becoming Parma’s Wenger?]

The beginning was a young midfielder from Sweden.

With Simon Soph's transfer almost certain, they brought in a midfielder to replace him first.

The evaluation was not bad.

At 18, he was young, but with many young players in Parma, adaptation didn't seem to be a problem.

[Santiago Brunetta! Close to joining Dortmund!]

However.

Dealing with the transfer of Santiago, who was responsible for Parma's left side, wasn't easy.

Coach Alain was recently fretting in his office because of Santiago's contract renewal.

Soon, news of Santiago’s contract renewal came.

[Santiago! Stays with Parma for one more year!]

[Parma succeeds in contract renewal! Stays with Santiago, who manages the left flank, for another season!]

With the successful contract renewal with Santiago, Parma faced Atalanta in the league.

* * *

Serie A, Round 15.

With Parma’s recent performances in the league and Europa League, the Ennio Tardini was nearly full.

Of course, there were many scouts among them.

Parma's squad had many talents needed by various club managers.

Considering Ennio Tardini could accommodate about 22,000 spectators, such enthusiasm was indeed special.

“Park Minho!”

“Minhooooooo!”

“Please show a fantastic performance today too!”

“Let’s go! Let’s gooo!”

The home fans' huge cheers.

But among those cheers, those shouting my name were gradually increasing.

Thanks to this, it was hell for the visiting Atalanta.

Facing Parma, who clung like leeches at home, they had to endure the harsh curses directed at them and the excessively loud cheers from 20,000 fans.

It was indeed a situation fitting the term "away hell."

Hence, there were rumors that Serie A teams were starting to shy away from away matches against Parma.

Anyway, the internal atmosphere in Parma was very good.

Despite taking a break for about two months, there were no significant issues with organization or performance.

Players returning from the World Cup didn't show signs of losing form either.

“Minho.”

“Why?”

“Messi has retired from the national team.”

“I know.”

“Do you think I can play well in Messi’s position?”

I shook my head at Santiago’s words.

Argentinian fans didn't have high expectations for a player who was just playing the same position as Messi.

He was a completely different type of player from Messi.

Expecting otherwise was strange.

So.

Santiago’s concern was a pointless one.

But I kept my mouth shut.

There was no need to tell him that fact.

“I must work really hard to fill Messi’s void. I will become Argentina’s new ace.”

Since he was mentally preparing himself like that.

There was no reason to disturb him.

Leaving Santiago behind.

I looked at Atalanta’s players.

Atalanta had announced in an interview that they would use a very aggressive formation and tactics in today’s match.

Parma also raised the fans' expectations by planning to counter Atalanta aggressively.

Soon, the first half began.

Atalanta’s fierce attack started.

-Anthony Pasalic’s breakthrough! Shooooot!

-Gooooooal! Atalanta scores the first goal at Ennio Tardini!

-Fantastic breakthrough followed by a back shot that completely fooled Parma’s Casa!

The score came from Casa’s mistake and the breakthrough of Atalanta’s key attacker, Anthony Pasalic.

I saw Casa blaming himself and goalkeeper Jose Juan trying to calm the defense.

Turning my gaze forward again, I saw Atalanta’s players celebrating.

Celebrating already?

The first half had just started.

There was still plenty of time.

We just needed to slowly take control.

“Let’s play as usual!”

“Focus! Focus!”

Other players said what I wanted to say instead.

The game resumed.

Santiago’s declaration of “I will fill Messi’s void!” didn’t seem in vain.

As soon as he got the ball, he showed sharp breakthroughs that he hadn’t shown before, quickly breaking through Atalanta’s right wing-back, Viggo Mehle.

-Santiago! Santiago!

-The player who moved defensively in the first half is now actively targeting Atalanta’s right side.

Thanks to this, space opened up in front of me.

I wasn’t foolish enough to miss such space.

“Minho!”

Santiago called me.

As I quickly moved into the open space in Atalanta’s defense, a sharp pass connected perfectly to my feet.

Is he really thinking of filling Messi’s void?

This pass was truly precise enough to give me goosebumps.

It was touching to see such a day come for the inconsistent Santiago.

Thinking back, Santiago was often a substitute in crucial moments among Argentina’s solid second-line resources.

A super sub who consistently recorded assists in every game.

Yes, Santiago had grown.

Tatatat!

As soon as my explosive pace, honed through recent training, burst out, Atalanta’s Gerard Dinsic came in with a tackle.

Swoosh!

The problem was my explosive and direct breakthrough was faster than he expected.

Secondly, the delay caused by his sliding tackle was quite long.

Not using this would be foolish.

Whistle!

-Gerard Dinsic’s foul!

-The referee pulls out a card!

-Minho earns a free-kick chance from a close distance!

-Minho looks exceptionally agile today!

A free-kick chance from a good position.

I saw Gerard Dinsic spewing curses as he got up.

In this position, using another player seemed better than aiming directly.

Showing two fingers to Santiago who approached, signaling the pattern.

Santiago nodded and conveyed my instructions to Filippo who started today’s match.

Filippo, who entered the penalty area, tapped Kenese’s back twice.

Kenese nodded at me.

Alright, everything was ready.

As soon as the referee blew the whistle, I quickly ran towards the ball without raising my hand.

Boom!

The ball, kicked strongly, curved significantly more than usual and flew accurately towards Kenese’s head.

“It’s Kenese!”

At the shout of an Atalanta player, everyone’s eyes turned to Kenese, and Kenese avoided the header.

The chaotic situation in the penalty area.

Filippo Asnelli, who moved behind Kenese, kicked the fallen ball strongly into the net.

-Gooooooal!

-Filippo Asnelli of Parma scores the equalizer!

-Minho’s assist! And Filippo’s goal! It’s fantastic!

Alright, the game was back to square one.

Leaving behind the thrilling free-kick feeling, I headed back to my position.

“Filippoooooo!”

“Minho! Park Minho!”

“Parma! Parma!”

As the game tied, home fans started cheering loudly again.

* * *

Joshua Feizoff, who joined Parma in the winter, watched Parma’s game from the stands with a strange eagerness in his eyes.

“That player is Minho…….”

The player creating a miraculous fairytale for Parma.

To the fans, Park Minho, known as ‘Parma’s God’ and ‘Fantastista,’ was going wild in today’s match.

-Minhoooo! It’s fantastic!

-Hattrick! Parma leads 4-3!

-What a goal fest in today’s match! Parma and Atalanta show explosive performances!

Overall, Atalanta’s performance was superior.

Their attack routes were varied, and every attacker recorded attack points evenly.

But it was Atalanta who was losing.

Because of ‘Parma’s God’ who scored 3 goals and assisted 1 in today’s match.

Joshua played for Sweden’s ‘Malmo FF,’ but his decision to join Parma was solely because of Park Minho’s performance in the Coppa Italia final.

Watching that match on TV, he resolved to play with that player.

This winter, he could fulfill that resolution.

He felt both excitement and disappointment.

“The other players…… are below standard.”

It was disappointing.

The quality of passes to a player displaying such beautiful football was too poor.

“It’s the worst.”

Especially that big striker, he wasn’t the kind of footballer he thought.

A gorilla who could just shoot well suited him more.

The more he watched the match, the more he believed he was the only one who could engrave ‘beauty’ into Parma’s football.

The same went for the second half.

Only one player was shining brightly.

Even when Atalanta scored an equalizer to make it 4-4, it was the same.

While the dumb players were flustered by the equalizer, Park Minho showed a mysterious smile and remained calm.

“As expected……. He’s amazing.”

Joshua’s eyes sparkled.

Just as he expected, Park Minho scored a stunning individual goal in the 33rd minute of the second half, recording a ‘poker’ (four goals).

He scored 4 goals and assisted 1 in one match.

It was like he led the match alone.

Watching the match with a stunned expression, Joshua suddenly stood up and shouted.

“Yes! This is it! This is football!"

It was exactly what he expected.

Joshua believed joining Parma instead of Valencia was an excellent choice in his life.

* * *

[A thrilling comeback victory! The bloody battle of two attacking teams ends 3-2 -> 4-3 -> 5-4!]

[Scoring 4 goals and assisting 1 in one match! ‘Parma’s God’ is invincible at home.]

[Coach Gasperini laments Park Minho’s one-man show!]

[Coach Alain Lavagne, ‘Yes, football is a sport where the team that scores more goals wins!’]

[Defense crumbled under heavy pressure! What tactical adjustments should Parma make for the second half of the season?]

[19 goals and 10 assists in the league, 7 goals and 11 assists in the Europa League, 26 goals and 21 assists in the season. These are Minho's stats for just the first half of the season.]

-Park Minhoooo!

-Wow! Minho! Minho! Minho!

-Minho is a god! Minho is a god! Minho is a god! Minho is a god! Minho is a god! Minho is a god!

-Atalanta! Losing to a god is a natural result.

-Hahaha! This is it!

We narrowly won against Atalanta.

The young players succumbed to the opponent’s strong pressure, conceding consecutive goals, but thanks to the attacking line in good form, we could push through and win with goals.

Honestly, it was a match we could have lost, but luck was somewhat on our side.

“Everyone! Here’s Joshua Feizoff who joined us recently. Help him adapt well to the team!”

At the words of Assistant Coach Mateo, everyone clapped.

Then Joshua stepped forward and, with a peculiar look, scanned the squad before making a shocking statement.

“I, Joshua, was disappointed watching the match against Atalanta.”

“I will show you the true beauty of football.”

He was truly an amazing guy.

Everyone stared at Joshua with bewildered expressions, seeing him lost in his own world.
