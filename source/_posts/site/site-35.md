## 15. Park Minho's That Day (1)

Parma is cruising.

No, there's no need to say they're cruising; they're tearing Serie B apart with overwhelming performances.

The term "undefeated in the league" is not something easily achieved.

Being the ace of such a team inevitably draws a lot of attention.

If that ace is a Korean player, it also gives broadcasting stations, obsessed with ratings, a reason to buy Serie B or Italian Cup game rights.

Thanks to this, after the first half of the season ended,

Serie B broadcasts started,

and from the Italian Cup 3rd round match against AS Roma, it was broadcasted in Korea.

Now, stories about Park Minho related to Serie B and the Italian Cup often appeared in the community.

However, not all of them were favorable opinions.

[Title: Honestly, Park Minho is overrated.]

Content: With players like Franco-Santiago-Gennaro helping him, it's honestly strange if he doesn't record that many attack points.

[Comments]

- Does 31 goals and 24 assists seem like a joke to you?

- Hahaha, there are really people like this, huh?

- Did you perhaps bet on the 3rd round of the Italian Cup?

- How low must you think of the Serie B level... At least Park Minho can be an ace for a lower-tier team in the top 4 leagues.

Of course, unfavorable opinions are in the minority.

Interestingly, a man running a mackerel restaurant is also part of that minority.

He spent his days off from the mackerel restaurant doing football lectures and sharing stories about Shin Junseo from his high school days on MeTube, growing his MeTube channel.

His unexpectedly good storytelling led to some viral videos, and with 30,000 subscribers, he established himself as a respectable football creator, so he contemplated quitting the mackerel restaurant.

Yeah, the man's name is Baek Seunghoon.

A man with remarkably strong thighs.

He was a peer of Park Minho.

He subtly looked down on Park Minho's success.

Perhaps it was inferiority.

Because the status between him, once called the Korean Messi in middle school, and Park Minho, who was just another player, had changed.

Maybe that's why.

He bit, chewed, tasted, and enjoyed tearing down Park Minho.

But the results were not as satisfying as expected.

[Title: Honestly, Park Minho is a fluke.]

Content: In middle and high school, he was just Baek Seunghoon's sidekick, who was expected to be the Korean Messi.

[Comments]

- Middle and high school? Baek Seunghoon was just a flashy middle school prospect.

- The real Korean Messi is Lee Sungwoo.

- Hahaha, Baek Seunghoon? Isn't he running a mackerel restaurant now? Lee Sungwoo, at least, is consistently active after returning from Belgium to Korea.

- Honestly, Lee Sungwoo's physicality is a bit lacking. If not for that, he would've endured in peripheral European leagues.

- Baek Seunghoon? He's just Shin Junseo's high school junior, isn't he? Nothing else to his name, right?

- Seunghoon? Seunghoon-ah! Get ready to open your mackerel restaurant. I'll visit for lunch, hahaha.

- Ko-ri-an Me-ssi, Seunghoon-ah, even Lee Sungwoo, who is a year younger than you, is a pro. What Korean Messi are you talking about, hahaha.

"Damn it!"

Baek Seunghoon, angry and ridiculed in the community, threw his smartphone into the pile of mackerel he was handling.

Smack!

But thinking about the installment payments, he reluctantly picked up the smartphone again.

With the smartphone reeking of mackerel, he began fervently using his thumbs.

[Title: Honestly, Park Minho needs to prove himself.]

Content: Against Inter, he will surely flounder, make zero goals, zero assists, weird passes, get one thumbs-up, and that's it.

[Comments]

- Seunghoon-ah, how pathetic.

- Hahaha, he's already proven himself against AS Roma, and Seunghoon is funny asking for more proof, right?

- Writer: I’m not Baek Seunghoon. Just a viewer of Baek Seunghoon's MeTube.

- Haha, were you a Baek fanatic? Hahaha.

- Who? Who? Who's Nunu Cantoo, damn it!

- Seriously, Baek fanatics think Baek Seunghoon carried Shin Junseo and Park Minho in high school, hahaha.

- Shin Junseo was preparing to transfer to Borussia Mönchengladbach, so he didn't play much in his third year. Park Minho eventually pushed Baek Seunghoon out and alternated as a starter and rotation player in his third year, hahaha.

- Baek Seunghoon = High school third-string winger, haha.

- What are Baek fanatics thinking, hyping a 30K subscriber Baek Seunghoon on MeTube? If Baek Seunghoon was that good, he would've gone pro before Park Minho, right?

- Writer: Anyway... Park Minho's level will be exposed in the match against Inter, for sure, hahaha.

Feeling relieved, Baek Seunghoon left the final comment and quickly closed the community, putting his mackerel-smelling smartphone back in his pocket and started handling the mackerel again.

“Inter will definitely win.”

For his jealousy and the 200,000 won he bet on Toto, Inter had to win.

He prayed to the goddess of football for Park Minho to get crushed in the match against Inter.

* * *

There are days like that.

Days when your body feels unusually light and the sensation in your feet is so clear that anything seems possible.

Days when you feel like you could trap even a tofu with your feet.

Days when you feel like you could trap a falling pottery from the 7th floor with your feet without breaking it.

Headed to Milan for the away game against Inter.

I had just woken up in the hotel and felt that my body was more sensitive and lighter than usual.

There were times when I felt like this in the past.

It was the day when I was just about to be promoted to sergeant.

It felt like the god of football had descended, and my body was light and my feet were sensitive that day.

I still remember scoring 13 goals alone and leading our platoon to victory, and one of the guys from another platoon said, "Did you want frozen food that badly?"

Anyway.

To have such a body condition before the match against Inter.

Maybe I could showcase the plays I had only seen in videos and wanted to try later.

Especially, I was excited about the first touch, which was a technique even I found hard to follow.

In the light training session in the morning, my light movements caught everyone's attention.

Bbaengjilee looked at me with a surprised expression.

Kenneth nodded his head in amazement as he watched my smooth first touch.

“You seem really light today.”

I nodded at Bbaengjilee’s words.

I really felt light.

And I felt like I could do anything.

With my body feeling so light, confidence naturally followed.

The coach also looked at me with a satisfied expression.

After the morning training session, we had lunch and took a short break before heading to the stadium by bus.

The official name is Giuseppe Meazza.

But fans call it San Siro.

Today, at this home ground of AC Milan and Inter, we challenge the champions of Serie A.

I also think San Siro fits better than Giuseppe Meazza.

Even the Italians in Milan mostly preferred calling it San Siro over Giuseppe Meazza.

It's quite an old stadium.

Even though it was renovated in 2016, the exterior of this stadium still feels quite cold.

Maybe it’s because of the eleven concrete towers surrounding it.

“The grass here is hybrid grass.”

“What kind of grass is that?”

“It's a combination of natural grass reinforced with artificial grass. San Siro's roof affects the growth of the grass.”

“You know quite a bit, huh?”

“I studied landscaping before playing football.”

Bbaengjilee’s eyes sparkled at my explanation.

Well, the reason I know so much about grass is actually because I studied a lot to get a job in golf course facility management.

Then I started studying grass related to football stadiums, so I still remember.

Because artificial grass is mixed in, the surface is more uniform than regular natural grass, making the rebound a bit less.

Because of this, the ball feels faster when it bounces on the field compared to other stadiums, sometimes causing goalkeepers to miss the timing.

On the other hand, because the surface is uniform, the position where the ball bounces is more predictable, making it easier for some goalkeepers to catch shots.

“Wow! Minho, were you planning to become a grass manager later?”

“I was more interested in golf course management. But just in case, I studied both.”

If I hadn't become a football player.

I probably would have returned to Korea and gotten a job at a golf course.

We arrived at San Siro and headed to the away locker room.

Before the match started, we had some time to loosen up, so I planned to get used to the hybrid grass then.

Honestly, I’ve only played on natural grass in every match, so this is my first time on hybrid grass.

I stepped onto the field to warm up.

The rebound felt definitely less on this grass.

Because of that, the ball felt like it shot out quickly.

Santiago, with a curious expression, kicked the ball a few times and then passed it to me accurately, understanding the feeling.

In contrast, Kenneth seemed to have no sense of it at all.

This is a bit worrying...

But honestly, what we expect from Kenneth is in other areas, so we have to accept some of it.

More importantly, the ball sticking to my foot felt distinctly different from usual.

The ball just moved the way I wanted it to.

Moreover, my body was light, allowing my movements to flow smoothly without stopping.

I had high hopes, thinking I might really show an amazing performance in today's match.

* * *

Honestly, Inter initially didn’t pay much attention to Parma Calcio.

They saw them as just a team that got lucky to beat Roma and move up.

That was their level of recognition.

But after watching Parma Calcio win their next three matches 8-0, 5-1, 6-0, they realized something was off and started to analyze them.

And they realized.

Parma Calcio was not an easy team.

Especially the harmony of the second line consisting of Park Minho-Santiago-Franco was so precise that even Serie A starting defenders couldn’t easily stop them.

Recently, a big striker named Kenneth appeared, further complicating Inter's analysis.

So they gave up on many things and focused on one.

Exploiting Kenneth, who had many weaknesses.

It was easier than expected.

By increasing Kenneth's ball possession time, they had enough.

Since he was weak with his feet, he wouldn't easily attempt dribbling; his passes would be clumsy, and his shots would likely be inaccurate.

Even if Kenneth's passes or shots succeeded, Inter's defense, which allowed the least goals in Serie A, could handle such variables.

And so the match began.

As the Inter coach and analysis team predicted, Parma Calcio was clearly on the defensive from the start of the Italian Cup quarterfinal match, with Inter firmly in control.

-Parma, which showed overwhelming performances in the league, is clearly on the defensive this time.

-As expected, the opponent is different. Inter! They are showing their true form as Serie A champions!

But something felt strange.

“...”

Inter coach Gino Inzaghi turned his eyes to the front.

Unlike other attackers who were joining the defense, an Asian player quietly waiting for a counterattack between the defenders.

Park Minho was bothering him.

‘Why is that?’

Why was he feeling so uneasy?

Why was he focused on an attacker who had only made one touch in the first five minutes of the game?

“Yeah... he's just an attacker who cleanly trapped the ball and made a back pass.”

Cleanly trapped the ball?

Only then did coach Gino Inzaghi feel a strange sense of déjà vu.

“Was Minho’s first touch always this smooth?”

He was known for his good first touch.

But it wasn't at the level of feeling this smooth.

And he realized why he felt this déjà vu.

During his playing days.

When he was playing for Piacenza Calcio in Serie A.

He remembered seeing a Dutch player at Inter.

That Dutch player struggled to adapt to Italy, making his performance inconsistent, but he remembered that the player’s first touch always shone beautifully in any situation.

“Dennis Bergkamp!”

The moment he muttered the legendary name in his reminiscence.

Parma Calcio's counterattack began.

From Park Minho's right foot...!

* * *

The perspective is different.

This is the first time I’ve seen the entire field.

I can see all 22 players on the field.

I trapped the long forward pass with my right foot, quickly turned with my back to the defender, and positioned myself.

Then I passed to Santiago, who was sprinting up the wing, and I followed the defender.

The counterattack initiated by me.

Inter had five defenders.

We had three attackers.

We were short by two.

Kenneth was sprinting up quickly, so if we played calmly, it would be a 5 vs 4 situation.

After lightly trapping the ball passed back to me, I gave an upper body feint, moved the ball to the right, and I moved to the left side of the opponent.

The defender, unsure whether to chase the ball or me, seemed to compromise by grabbing my jersey.

But it wasn’t me who caught the ball moved to the right; it was Gennaro, who got there faster than me.

Gennaro made a long pass to the right wing.

Denis caught the ball and crossed it.

Kenneth, rushing in despite his size, headed the ball.

But rushing in made Kenneth's header less accurate than usual.

Inter managed to clear the ball.

-Inter! They successfully stopped Parma's counterattack.

-But Parma's attack continues! Franco Vazquez catches the cleared ball from Inter!

-He’s slowly building up.

The moment the counterattack failed.

Parma switched to a slow, positional attack.

And caught their breath.

They settled their disrupted rhythm and spent energy from defending in the early part of the first half.

Franco, trying to switch the ball to the wing.

That’s when I raised my hand.

Signaling for the ball.

He looked at me with a puzzled expression.

Franco's pass connected to me.

Ignoring Franco’s gaze that questioned how I would handle the tight pressure in the center, I moved.

Today, such pressure didn’t bother me much.

-The ball connects to Minho!

-Parma seems to be planning to attack through the center this time.

-But the center is crowded.

Inter's defensive midfielder Pietro Barella charged at me moving towards the center.

With a light upper body feint, I deceived Pietro and penetrated deeper.

Even in my usual condition, I had enough confidence to easily bypass one opponent.

But today, my body felt lighter.

Moreover, my foot's sensitivity was heightened.

I could guarantee.

I wouldn't lose the ball today.

I heard Pietro’s strange shout, which seemed like a curse as he got bypassed.

Deep inside, I was surrounded on all sides.

But I wasn’t afraid.

-Minho! He’s instantly isolated!

-He’s in danger! It feels like he recklessly penetrated through the center! Minho! Minho!

Three players charged at me.

Inter’s cooperative defense was quite formidable.

In my usual state, I would have easily lost the ball.

But today was different.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

With just three touches, I bypassed two players and connected the ball to Santiago, who was penetrating the center.

Inter’s players were startled and shaken.

I didn’t miss it.

“Return!”

Upon my shout, Santiago’s pass came back.

Inter’s defender.

Ricardo Bastoni blocked my front.

Quickly turning my back to Ricardo, I lifted the ball to Ricardo's right with my right foot outside-front.

Then I turned the other way, moving to Ricardo’s left.

Yeah, this is a Bergkamp turn.

Bergkamp pushed in with the ball to the right, but I turned the other way.

I felt it would work this way.

-Minho! Minhoooooooo!

-Wow! Minho!

-It’s a perfect opportunity! Such a clean touch completely bypassed the opponent!

In an instant, it became a one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper.

Without thinking, I shot strongly in a direction the goalkeeper couldn’t reach.

Smack!

-Goooooooal!

-Minho! A fantastic first touch! It felt like Bergkamp had returned to the field!

-He seems insane today! His first touch is more precise and beautiful than usual!

-Minho! Minhooooo! Minhooooo!

After scoring, I performed Thierry Henry’s knee slide, which Monica liked.

Screech!

Though knee slides aren’t good for knee health.

Sometimes showing it for someone you love isn’t bad.

“Isn’t this a complete Arsenal edition?”

Scoring like Bergkamp.

Celebrating like Thierry Henry.

Isn’t this going to make Monica ecstatic?
