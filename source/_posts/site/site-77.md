## 27. At the Fork in the Road (3)

As the first half ended,

the second half flew by in the blink of an eye.

Seeing the extra time held up by the fourth official, I could slowly see the end of this game.

[Parma 3 vs 1 Inter]

Perfect.

Well, the fact that I was involved in conceding that one goal wasn't great news, but...

I could endure by rationalizing with Aaron Ramsey's famous quote, which had become a meme in Korean overseas football communities: "I'm a midfielder, so..."

Hmm, if I localize it to my style, "I'm a striker, so..." fits better.

I mean, who would have known that the cross that deflected off my body would become a goal?

Anyway, Goran Perisic, who was my opponent today, finished the game with a face that looked like he was about to cry.

Who told him to underestimate me?

I'm a striker who is quite good at defense.

Anyway,

the home fans close to the fence were clenching their fists, almost certain of the team's victory.

"Hahaha! Just hold on for 5 more minutes!"

"Inter! You guys are weaklings!"

"Let's go! Let's go! Parma!"

Inter's coach, Gino Inzaghi, was already shaking his head in resignation.

Lautaro Marcius, who was brimming with confidence before entering the field, was shaking his head with a sullen expression.

I don't understand why this guy, who is constantly linked with big clubs, has no intention of transferring.

Well, it must be because he likes Inter that much.

There's no reason for me to meddle.

About 2 minutes past the extra time.

Goran Perisic, who had the ball, moved it to the center and tried to get behind me.

So I lightly tugged on his uniform.

Tweet!

- Minho interrupts the opponent's flow at the right moment.

I traded a yellow card for one of their chances.

Of course, I did it because the chances of me getting another card in the next game, where I'll be a forward again, are low.

Our coach grabbed his head in distress.

As if to say, what if I miss a game due to accumulated warnings?

Of course, I brushed off such worries with the self-rationalization of "I'm a striker, so..."

This is really convenient.

If I make a mistake other than scoring a goal, I can just rationalize it with that magic phrase.

What? You think it's too selfish?

Yes, as long as a striker scores goals, it's fine.

A striker even comes down to the right wing to participate in defense... Shouldn't this level of mistake be overlooked?

Isn't that too harsh?

"You bastard... One day you'll get your comeuppance from someone like you."

Goran Perisic gritted his teeth and glared at me.

I don't know what I did to deserve such harsh words.

Where else can you find a gentleman like me?

Boom!

I took the ball from Goran Perisic and sent a poorly executed early cross, which Kenneth finished.

- Goooooooooooal!

- A hammer blow in extra time! Kenneth Martinez shakes the net with a header!

I thought he had scored a hat-trick with this.

But it turns out the ball deflected off Jeroen de Free's attempt to clear Kenneth's header and went in.

So, it became an own goal.

Ah, I lost an assist.

That's so disappointing.

Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!

Finally, the referee blew the final whistle.

To be honest, I was very tense.

But we completely dominated the game and won.

Honestly, I thought it would be a tough match against Inter, but Inter collapsed more easily than expected, leaving me feeling a bit unsatisfied.

Was the match against Inter always like this?

I even wondered.

Is this the crossroads for winning the league?

It felt like we bulldozed through the crossroads, leaving me dumbfounded.

The crossroads for winning the league?

Ta-da, Parma, the bulldozer, has cleared the crossroads!

* * *

[Parma 4-1 Victory! Lightly defeating even the title contender Inter!]

[Finally within reach of the title! Parma's fairy tale has finally crossed the penultimate ridge!]

[Parma, unlike Leicester City's fairy tale, comfortably maintaining the top spot!]

[Now 10 points ahead of second-place Inter again! Parma's title within reach!]

[Can Parma achieve its first Serie A title in club history?]

[Park Minho records 36 goals and 30 assists this season! Breaking multiple Serie A records in one season!]

[Comments]

- Woooooo! Minhooooo!

- Parma! Parma! Parma!

- Finally, we've come this far! We're really close to the title!

- It's only the 24th round... We don't know when that 10-point gap might be closed, but with Minho, we can definitely hold on!

- Screw you, Serie A!

- Win the league! Win the Coppa Italia! Win the Europa League! Let's go, Parma!

A somewhat anticlimactic end to the Inter match.

Of course, thanks to this victory, Parma is one step closer to the title.

Naturally, the fans were ecstatic.

Moreover, other Serie A teams started to take us more seriously.

This means more teams are trying to "park the bus" against us.

- Verona! Eventually, they go on the offensive!

- They have no choice! Their plan to sit back with ten men and slowly shake Parma's mentality collapsed after conceding two goals from Minho's crosses!

Thanks to that, I haven't been able to score lately.

Still, I got two assists, so it wasn't bad.

On the other hand, Kenneth has been on fire recently.

He scored in the match against Inter and again in the match against Verona, bringing his league tally to 24 goals.

This means he's now just 3 goals behind my league-leading 27 goals.

"Hey... Honestly, you're scared, right?"

"What are you talking about?"

"League top scorer! You're scared Kenneth might take it from you."

When the cheeky guy asked with a sly smile, it strangely triggered my defiant nature.

"Ah... Should I ask the coach to let me play on the left wing next time?"

Hearing my words, our cheeky guy shivered.

Then he shouted, "Absolutely not!" and listed ten reasons why I should play at the front or on the right wing.

Geez... Does he fall for it every time?

No matter how many times he gets pranked, the cheeky guy always comes near me, looking like he can't resist teasing me.

Well, that's his charm.

Anyway,

what awaited Parma, who had neatly dealt with Verona, was the second knockout round of the Europa League.

Our opponent was Athletic Bilbao.

This meant our opponent was the Spanish team that beat Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach in the round of 16 playoffs.

Due to the rescheduled fixtures because of the Qatar World Cup and the resurgence of a new COVID variant from early February, the round of 16 playoffs and the round of 16 matches were held as single-leg ties.

Wow... Honestly, COVID is really nasty.

Still, since we are gradually returning to our previous way of life, I don't think it's a big problem.

The match would be held at our home ground but with no spectators.

Anyway,

since the round of 16 match was a single-leg tie, we had to prepare well.

It wasn't a home-and-away format where we had another chance.

Hence, our coach planned to field all the main players for this match.

Well, I was worried I would be playing on the right wing again for this match, but there was news that Fabian Pavone, who was supposed to take two weeks to recover, was recovering very quickly.

There was news that Fabian might make his return in the match against Athletic Bilbao, putting a smile on our coach's face.

Throughout training, I couldn't help but laugh seeing our coach nodding while looking at me, saying, "Yes, Minho is a forward."

Oh, Monica has returned to Italy.

She was staying at my house again since early March.

Having dinner and chatting with Monica after a long time felt somewhat healing.

"Minho... What is this?"

But from the moment she caught me with a dirty magazine I secretly bought, 'healing' turned into 'killing.'

* * *

"Minho... Are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine."

Parma, preparing for the match against Bilbao,

Park Minho, who had been playfully tormented by Monica the night before, didn't look too good.

Even Santiago was worried.

But my condition quickly recovered.

Anyway,

there were no major issues while preparing for the Bilbao match.

Except for the fact that all training sessions at the training ground were conducted behind closed doors to minimize external contact.

This was partly due to COVID, but it also meant we were thoroughly preparing for the Bilbao match.

It was also proof that what Parma wanted was not just the Serie A title.

Yes, Parma also wanted to win the Europa League.

Questions like "Europa too?" would arise.

And all sorts of negative doubts would follow.

- Winning the league alone seems challenging enough.

- They'll end up missing out on both.

- Better to aim for the next time.

And so on.

Many doubts would stick like a tail.

But Alain Levagne was confident enough to answer those doubts.

"Do you think this team can even win the Coppa Italia properly after Minho leaves?"

Of course, the person hearing this question would keep their mouth shut.

Alain Levagne was confident.

And the Parma board knew it too, which is why they fulfilled all of Alain Levagne's wishes this season.

Yes,

Parma was challenging for a mini-treble this season.

Otherwise, Alain Levagne wouldn't have bothered to ensure the performance of rotation members.

"Go big or go home!"

Alain Levagne muttered, recalling a Korean saying he learned from Park Minho.

Anyway,

perhaps because of the renewed fear of COVID, interest in Park Minho grew even more.

The buyout clause of '52 million' euros, which was almost half of what other top-level attackers were worth, further increased Park Minho's value.

Naturally, scouts wanted to see how far a player like Park Minho could go.

That's why they came all the way to Italy to watch the match on March 2, where Park Minho was showing his full potential.

- Minhooooo!

- A goal in just 2 minutes! Athletic Bilbao concedes an early goal in the 2nd minute of the first half!

"Damn... That's just fantastic."

"The transfer fee isn't the problem. It's the salary."

"If we don't bring that player in, the fans will burn our club's office."

"That would be the least of our problems."

The scouts' eyes were all on Park Minho.

While they had their eyes on other players too, only Park Minho hadn't renewed his contract with Parma's squad.

In other words, it meant he would leave this summer.

And the clubs that failed to sign Park Minho would be considered losers.

And observing this scene quietly, Park Minho's agent, Leo, was smiling brightly.

* * *

"Block him! Block him!"

Athletic Bilbao, who had been fluctuating between 4th and 5th place in this season's La Liga, struggling for a Champions League spot, was shaken from the start of the match against Parma.

They were definitely a strong team.

Despite the difficulty of signing players due to their pure-blood policy, they consistently produced good players from their well-developed youth system.

But even Athletic Bilbao couldn't avoid a major humiliation when facing the 'God of Parma.'

- As expected, Minho fits best at the forefront!

- Ah! Bilbao's defense is in disarray.

- With this, Parma successfully takes the initiative from the start! Amazing!

"I'm here."

Hearing my words after scoring the opening goal, the cheeky guy laughed loudly and shook his head.

I never thought I would end up saying such things myself.

Lately, I've been enjoying soccer so much that I've been half out of my mind, often blurting out such cheesy lines.

Athletic Bilbao is definitely a strong team.

But based on my experience of facing Inter, Juventus, AC Milan, and Lazio, Bilbao was still lacking to be called a strong team.

- Minho! Grabs the ball and runs! He's fast!

- Step over! And accelerates in an instant, bypassing a defender with just his speed!

- Woooooo! Minho! Minho! Minho!

Ah, if the league I was playing in was La Liga, my dribble now would have been called 'Ankara Minho.'

That's a bit disappointing.

I wanted to hear 'Ankara' once too.

Clang!

My shot, which unfortunately hit the goalpost and went out.

As I scratched my head in disappointment, Bilbao's central defender Juan Nunez shouted with an exasperated expression.

"Damn dog! Stop running!"

Well, you should have prepared proper marking for me.

Serie A teams have two players marking me just to prevent me from scoring, but Bilbao, with their confidence, only assigned one marker to me.

Naturally, Bilbao was getting punished thoroughly.

They should have left me alone.

"Minho!"

The cheeky guy called my name.

Receiving his pass, I started to break through near the opponent's half-space again.

Jonny Birchece, who was urgently stretching his leg.

The left full-back coming to this position meant that the flank was completely open.

Passing it back to the cheeky guy, a sharp cross accurately connected to Kenneth's head.

- Kenneth's header!

- Goooooal! Parma extends the lead to 2-0! Kenneth Marsetico's perfect header goal!

- Minho and Kenneth! The two players have created 17 goals in the Europa League! Parma is amazing!

Although it wasn't an assist,

Well, I was happy as I had initiated the play.

Bilbao was shaking every time they faced me, gradually losing their will.

Maybe because I was in a good mood,

It felt like I was frequently going up alone compared to other matches.

What if I get exhausted in the second half?

Remember Mr. Ramsey's famous quote.

"I'm a striker, so..."

Yes, because I'm a striker.

As long as I score goals, it's okay.

- Minho! Running fast!

- Pass to Filippo! And a return pass! The ball returns to Minho, who is penetrating behind the defenders!

The marking on me is still weak.

Bilbao is paying the price for underestimating me.

Like this.

- Minho! La Croqueta! And a shot!

- Goooooal! Minho's multi-goal!

- Season's 38th goal! Minho scores his 9th goal in the Europa League this season!

- Amazing! Parma scores 3 goals in the first half, pushing Athletic Bilbao back!

There was something awkward even when I scored a goal, and I realized it was because the stands were silent with no spectators.

"Tsk..."

When will this damn COVID end?

Just when it seemed to calm down with the spread of Omicron, another variant is wreaking havoc again.

I hope it ends here.

Indeed, soccer is fun when enjoyed with everyone.
