## 46. A Team That Doesn't Seem to Lose (2)

The two teams ahead of the League Cup final.

Leicester City and Arsenal.

Among them, Leicester City manager Richard Rodgers felt a glimmer of hope as he watched Park Minho, who recorded two assists in the Palace match.

"Of course! Even that monster gets tired!"

Palace marked the tired Park Minho well.

Thanks to this, Park Minho couldn't show much impact in this game and remained silent.

Of course, even in a sluggish game, he recorded two assists, letting them know that he's never an easy opponent.

The fact is, even when the monster is tired, he's still a monster.

But there was hope.

The monster involved in 70% of Arsenal's goals.

Just the fact that the striker Park Minho was a bit tired made Arsenal's play frustratingly sluggish in the game against Palace.

If it weren't for lucky goals by Amani Richards and Gabriel Artinelli, Arsenal would have drawn 1-1 in this game.

"When else will we get a chance to break Arsenal if not now?"

With the League Cup final coming up quickly, Park Minho wouldn't be able to fully recover his stamina.

Leicester City wanted to win the League Cup final against the nearly invincible Arsenal.

Manager Richard Rodgers had already done a lot of preparation for this League Cup final.

"We can definitely win."

Yes, he was confident that he could defeat Arsenal with his tactics in this final match.

Didn't they draw in the previous league match?

This time, it wasn't just about drawing; winning was possible.

He smiled with that conviction.

* * *

Indeed, whether you rest in December or not, by the second half of the season, football players inevitably have to play with tired bodies.

Of course, I was managing my stamina well, receiving appropriate care.

I only played 60 minutes in the last Palace match.

There was no reason to be tired.

Of course, I could feel that I was definitely more tired than in the first half of the season.

But that didn't mean I was showing poor performance.

So, why was I silent in the match against Palace? There's no particular explanation.

It was just... things didn't go well for me, but the other players managed well.

But the next game will be different.

The reason I was silent in the last Palace match was that I played much more conservatively to save my stamina.

If I hadn't been preparing for the League Cup final, I could have scored at least one more goal in the last game.

Anyway.

Ahead of the League Cup final, my stamina was at its peak.

Contrary to some experts' concerns about my stamina, I had managed it well myself.

Ahead of the League Cup final, Alain Levagne, who brought out tailored tactics against Leicester City, was encouraging and leading the players at the training ground.

"Our manager is really determined."

"Why?"

"I never imagined he would prepare such tactics against Leicester City."

"Me neither."

Seeing such passionate behavior, Lorenzo shook his head and sighed.

Having recently enjoyed scoring some goals, he let out a deep sigh at the fact that he wouldn't have such fun in this League Cup final.

"Ah... I just want to score five goals in one match."

"Even if you say that, there's no way."

"I really want to score five goals in the final."

Even though Lorenzo was grumbling like that, there was no choice.

Our manager brought out a somewhat defensive tactic to face manager Richard Rodgers this time.

It's almost time to get off work.

Lorenzo looked at me with a puzzled expression as I tried to leave work early for the first time in a long while.

"Leaving already?"

"Yeah, from March, I need to manage my stamina by doing just the basic training."

"Well... January and February were really busy."

"Want to go eat?"

"Sure."

I thought of having a light meal outside with Lorenzo and then heading home.

Today, since Monica isn't home, it would be boring.

Where did Monica go?

She left for work in Paris again.

She might come back around May?

At least, that's what I knew.

So, I was saying I'd eat out with Lorenzo and then go home.

Hmm... Lorenzo is asking the others if they want to join us for dinner.

Honestly, if it's just Lorenzo and me eating out, we'd probably end up talking only about football.

Fortunately, Jules Kaembe and Bruno Campos joined us.

I sighed in relief, thinking we could talk about various things besides football.

Jules Kaembe, who transferred in winter and joined the team, was gradually appearing in matches.

He had already played in five league games and recorded two assists.

With the pressure gone, his performance was improving.

Although there were talks about his unstable position as he was substituted in the last two games, I thought our manager was giving him time to slowly adapt to the winger position.

"Minhoooooo!"

"Please sign!"

"Lorenzo! Lorenzo!"

"Wow! Minho! I love you!"

On the way home after training, we gave autographs to the Gooners waiting in front of the parking lot and then drove to the city.

"So, why does Jules look so upset? Does he hate kids?"

When giving autographs to the kids, Jules Kaembe seemed to sulkily step away.

To Lorenzo's question, Jules Kaembe sighed deeply and answered.

"No, it's because of that kid."

"What's with that kid?"

"That kid goes around various clubs and collects famous players' signed uniforms. He's notorious."

"What?"

"He probably told Southampton he was a fan of Brian and got Brian's autograph."

I didn't know that.

Geez... kids these days are quite sly, aren't they?

* * *

Wembley Stadium is definitely different.

You can naturally understand why it's called the Mecca of football when you see its tremendous size.

We are now fighting against Leicester City at Wembley Stadium, the so-called 'Mecca of football,' for the League Cup trophy.

On match day, Wembley Stadium was already full of spectators.

Indeed... whether in Italy or England, people are crazy about football.

Before entering the field, I could see Leicester City's ace and striker Jamie Vardy, who led their fairytale run, in the tunnel.

Although he only played 12 games this season due to frequent injuries, considering he scored 7 goals in those 12 games, he might still be able to hold the frontline for Leicester City for a few more years.

I thought that the 37-year-old striker might want to win the trophy in what could be his last career match.

He saw me and smiled before looking ahead.

Even before the match, Leicester City's manager Richard Rodgers had stirred up excitement by saying he had found a way to neutralize Minho.

In England, manager Richard Rodgers is nicknamed 'the maker of reckless statements,' so I was a bit curious about the method he found to neutralize me.

Of course, we also had tactics prepared to face Leicester City... so it should be interesting.

Just as we prepared a nearly full-strength lineup, Leicester City also brought out all their main players.

"Hmm... did their manager say something in the pre-match interview?"

"What?"

"That he'd stop me and win no matter what."

"Ah... that reckless statement? Yeah, right... let's see him try."

Lorenzo smirked and shook his head.

I didn't like the strange smile he gave me, but as we were entering the field, I turned my gaze away.

It was different from the Emirates Stadium.

I finally felt like I was really standing on the grass of Wembley Stadium.

As everything was ready and the cheers of the football fans in the stadium grew loud, the match started.

Arsenal, as usual, lined up in a 4-3-3 formation, while Leicester City brought out a 4-2-3-1 formation.

But five minutes into the match.

Manager Richard Rodgers shouted loudly as he saw us sitting back.

"You bastards! Stop parking the bus!"

Well, if you're upset, you can park the bus too.

Our prepared tactic was 'parking the bus.'

Except for Lorenzo Lupo at the front, all the players dropped deep.

It was a formation close to 4-5-1, and manager Richard Rodgers cursed with a face full of fury.

How do I know so well?

I could hear it clearly from the flanks.

It felt good to hear manager Rodgers yelling, "You bastards! Cunning Arsenal bastards!"

Well... unlike us sitting back, Leicester City players seemed a bit flustered.

Even if manager Rodgers prepared tactics... it would probably involve using Jamie Vardy for counter-attacks to score and then locking down the game.

I remembered a few games in the league where they had fun with that tactic.

"Why should you guys have all the fun?"

Yeah, we'll do it too.

We'll defend and then counter-attack the space behind the opponent's defense to score.

"BoOOOOOOO!"

The boos from Leicester City fans could be heard.

They must be thinking why we're sitting back like cowards.

Why? Because we also want to have some fun.

Like right now.

Thunk!

"Counter-attack!"

Leicester City had over 70% possession, but honestly, their forward passes were terribly inaccurate.

Arsenal players were waiting for such passes.

Jake Francis intercepted the ball and sent it long down the flank to start the counter-attack.

A pass connecting to the right flank.

Jules Kaembe, who our manager placed on the opposite flank for today, showcased his physical prowess.

Like a sports car racing down the autobahn, Jules Kaembe utterly devastated Leicester City's left flank.

Without any tricks, he simply bulldozed through Leicester City's left side with sheer speed and sent a long pass to the center.

- A long pass is connected! Lorenzo Lupo is in the center!

- Lorenzo! Lorenzo!

- He catches the ball and shoots!

Clang!

Unfortunately, the shot hit the goalpost and went out.

Lorenzo Lupo showed a regretful expression and gave a thumbs-up to Jules Kaembe.

Based on the first half alone, Leicester City had the upper hand.

But concentrating on defense, we weren't afraid of Leicester City's offense.

"It doesn't feel like we're going to lose."

With such solid defense.

How could we possibly lose?

I can confidently say it's impossible.

Look at those guys.

After facing a single counter-attack threat, Leicester City's players were hesitating more in their offense.

This is why football is all about physicality.

Stephan Castagne of Leicester City, who glanced at Jules Kaembe, was now positioned lower than before.

"Castagne! Move up! Be more aggressive!"

Manager Rodgers' shouts were useless.

Even with his yelling, Stephan Castagne's head was filled with the incredible speed and acceleration of Jules Kaembe, who devastated the left flank moments ago.

Thanks to this, Arsenal could focus on defense more comfortably.

Of course, we weren't just taking hits.

A little over 30 minutes into the first half.

This time, the ball rolled to my feet.

Arsenal's second counter-attack of the match was starting from my feet.
