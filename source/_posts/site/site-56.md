## 20. The New Season (2)

"This season looks promising as well."

Leo Carpentieri smiled brightly as he watched Park Minho, who recorded 1 goal and 2 assists in the first friendly match of the preseason.

He’s truly an amazing player.

It’s only been a year since his professional debut.

His status within Parma has reached an unassailable position.

In the European football scene, he has grown significantly to the point where many are showing interest.

What’s more astonishing is that, unlike most players who might develop a sense of ‘complacency’ at least a little, he still thinks he’s lacking.

"A player who doesn’t rest on his laurels and continuously seeks improvement... Truly admirable."

Even now, look at that completely different movement.

Compared to last year, he breaks the opponent’s offside trap and creates 1-on-1 chances much more naturally.

His control of the ball is as smooth as receiving soft tofu, followed by a clean shot after dribbling forward.

And lately, his passing has improved even more.

Park Minho is now close to being a complete player.

No, if he grows any more from here, he’s not a human but a game character.

Leo watched the video with a fascinated expression, captivated by Park Minho’s highly polished play.

Park Minho was that impressive.

Just watching his performance made his heart race.

Leo wasn’t the only one feeling this way.

The friendly match that Parma released on MiTube also received a great response in Korea due to Park Minho’s performance.

Clips of Park Minho’s plays even circulated in overseas football communities as GIFs.

- Uploaded with a GIF as well.

- A pass that pierced through 3 Bologna defenders, creating a 1-on-1 chance instantly.

- A cross after a Marseille turn.

[Comments]

- ㄷㄷㄷ That was sick.

- Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho!

- Wow; what’s up with that soft tofu trapping? Insane.

- Seriously... With that level of ball control, he could probably catch a falling ceramic from 30 meters without breaking it.

- What’s with that pass timing?

- How fun would it be to play football like that?

- Wow... Can we expect great things this season too?

Park Minho, who has improved even more since last season.

Watching him, Leo quietly paused the video.

Then he contacted someone.

To help make Park Minho even greater, he began to prepare step by step.

As the friendly matches continued, the expectations of Parma fans grew tremendously, like a balloon filled with too much air.

Normally, the players might be shaken by the high expectations, thinking, ‘Isn’t this too much pressure?’

But the performance was so good that such talk never came up.

How well were they doing?

They were doing insanely well.

A 4-0 victory against Bologna.

A 7-0 victory against Sassuolo.

A 7-1 victory against De Graafschap.

They showed overwhelming performance, leaving the opponents in a groggy state.

What was even more impressive was that the goals were not concentrated on one player; the six forwards registered in the first-team squad were evenly scoring, which was quite encouraging.

The young players, along with the newly reorganized defense, showed a surprisingly solid performance.

Especially, the beast-like saves of goalkeeper Jose Juan had Parma fans raving about the arrival of 'The Second De Gea.'

"Minho! Minho!"

"Minho! We count on you this season too!"

"Park! Mi-noooo!"

On the day of the last friendly match of the preseason against Ajax.

Since it was the last match of the preseason, it seemed that the opponents had also adjusted their starting lineup to their first team as much as possible.

Beep!

As soon as the referee blew the whistle, Ajax players concentrated their press in the central area.

They wanted us to attempt long passes.

By pressing the center and advancing the fullbacks, they tried to prevent us from easily building up through the center.

But there was no problem.

Unlike last season when the build-up always had to go through Franco or me, this season, we pushed it long to the sides.

"Minho!"

Santiago, switching to the center, raised his hand and called for a pass.

After deceiving the right fullback of Ajax, Fer Casnew, with upper body feinting, I immediately sent a cross.

Beyond the eyes drawn to Santiago.

Two targets moved in sync with my cross.

Filippo Asnell grabbed the ball lightly and started advancing slowly.

Despite the pressure from Ajax’s central defender Astel Gigart, he advanced slowly and then gently pushed the ball to the center.

Santiago, who had already dug into the center, did not control the pass and took a non-stop shot.

Thud!

"Good!"

"Goooooooal!"

"Santiago!"

Definitely different.

The attack is more diverse than last year.

We can compete in the air.

If necessary, we can make direct breakthroughs.

"Mi-nooooo!"

"Wow! Minhooooo!"

A few minutes after scoring the first goal, another chance came to me. This time, as I moved into the center and then darted outside, Ajax’s central midfielder Dyson Tyler reacted.

I passed to Banjiri, who was staying in the half-space, and then moved between the defenders, receiving a return pass.

As I quickly accelerated, another central defender of Ajax, Kalai Blind, approached.

I ran aggressively and then changed direction with a back shot, causing Kalai Blind to slip clumsily.

Waaaaaah!

As the fans cheered, I also shot strongly towards the gap left by Ajax’s mistake.

Bam!

Waaaaaah!

Park Minho! Park Minho!

Park Minho! Park Minho!

It feels so good.

Showing this level of performance against Ajax, who reached the quarterfinals of last season’s Champions League.

It would be a lie to say I wasn’t happy.

"Isn’t it possible for us to do well in the Europa League?"

Banjiri’s over-the-top excitement didn’t even feel like an exaggeration anymore, given Parma’s impressive form this preseason.

We defended the 2 goals scored in the first half and added 2 more in the second half, securing a 4-1 victory over Ajax.

Finally, the last friendly match of the preseason came to an end.

[Comments]

- The season opener is an away game.

- The home opener opponent is Torino! Let’s beat Genoa and Torino to gain momentum!

- Let’s be like Leicester in the EPL!

- Par-maaaaaaa!

- Stupid Parma! Release Minho’s jersey already! Why is it sold out?

An undefeated preseason.

The preseason, which left Parma fans with huge expectations, finally ended, and the season opener arrived.

The opener was an away game.

The opponent was Genoa CFC.

Genoa had consistently stayed in Serie A since the 07-08 season, with a mid-table level of strength.

Our coach expressed confidence that our team could easily overpower them.

In a pre-match interview, the coach exuded strong confidence, stating that he would leave a significant mark in Serie A.

Genoa’s coach, Vittorio Gassman, expressed displeasure and strongly countered that statement.

- Parma is a one-man team with Minho.

- We plan to start the season pleasantly with a win in the home opener.

- We know how to stop Minho.

- We have observed Minho closely, like under a microscope.

They say they know how to stop me.

Indeed, this is Serie A.

As soon as we moved up to the first division, the defensive measures against me became this strong.

That’s why I worked hard during the break to improve my stamina and polish my basic skills.

After all.

The world of professionals is like a jungle.

I was very curious to see how the Serie A defense differs from Serie B.

What? We even defeated Ajax?

That was preseason.

Surely, the regular season would be different.

It would probably be an intense pressure.

As my expectations swelled like a balloon, the opening day of Serie A finally arrived.

- Finally, Serie A has started! The 22-23 Serie A Round 1 match! We greet you from Genoa’s home ground after a long time!

- Genoa and Parma! Both teams reinforced their squads solidly this summer.

- That’s right! Both teams finished the preseason with good performances.

A match between a mid-table team and a newly promoted team.

Standing on the grand stage of Serie A, Parma’s players looked very excited.

On the other hand, Genoa’s players looked at us as if we were country bumpkins who just arrived in Seoul for the first time.

Indeed.

The old-timers of Serie A are different.

Such composure.

My expectations swelled even more.

Honestly, in ‘Serie B,’ there was no competitor from the second half onward.

Even I focused more on the joy of victory than the enjoyment of football itself during the second half.

That’s probably why the Coppa Italia games were more thrilling and fun.

AS Roma, Inter, Atalanta, AC Milan.

Playing against various strong teams allowed me to fully enjoy the fun of football itself.

So, I was a bit curious.

Would this team also provide the enjoyment of football itself, just like other Serie A teams?

Banjiri, seeing me, shook his head with a disgusted look, saying I was half crazy.

Kenez and Johan looked at me with sparkling eyes.

Gianluca looked at me with a worried expression, saying, ‘You might be disappointed...’

Genoa came out with a 4-2-3-1 formation.

Coach Vittorio Gassman liked to manage the game by tightly controlling the center through possession football, our coach told us.

Emotions rising gradually.

As the referee looked at both sides and blew the whistle to start the game.

I passed the ball to Kenez and started sprinting forward like crazy.

Kenez, holding the ball, passed it to Santiago.

Santiago dribbled shortly and then perfectly delivered the ball to my feet with a long, low ground pass.

An event that occurred 20 seconds into the first half.

The only players in front of me were Genoa’s defenders.

- As soon as the game starts, Parma catches a good chance with a long pass!

- Minho grabs the ball and runs!

- As expected, he’s fast! Minho!

Seeing me running quickly, Genoa’s defense was in a panic and wavered.

That’s strange.

I heard they prepared to stop me.

Why is the defense so weak?

- Wow! Minho! He’s running!

- Here comes the McGeady spin!

- Minho! He swiftly dribbles past one defender! No one can catch up with him!

Strange.

Why am I getting past them so easily?

Didn’t you guys prepare hard?

Didn’t you analyze me under a microscope?

- Minhooooo! Minhooooo!

- Minho penetrates the center and shoots for a goooooooal!

- A goal scored within 41 seconds of the first half!

- Minho scores the first goal of the season as easily as sipping soup! Amazing! Truly amazing!

What?

Why did I get through so easily?

Having scored, I ran towards the Parma fans who came all the way to the away game to watch.

"Minhooooo!"

"The first goal of the season is, of course, Minho!"

"I love you, Minho!"

"Let’s go for the top scorer this season too!"

Amid occasional Korean words.

It seemed there were fans who came from Korea to watch the game.

Only then did my excitement subside, and I felt my head cooling down.

"Is this team really a Serie A club?"

Finally, disappointment set in.

You guys said you prepared hard to stop me.

You said you analyzed me like looking through a microscope.

Then why did you concede so easily?

"I, Park Minho, am disappointed in Genoa."

Just like the worst company commander I met during my military service, I was really disappointed in Genoa.
