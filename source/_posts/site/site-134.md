## 48. Another Victory! (5)

After Amani scored the opening goal.

The players' expressions became much more relaxed.

How should I put it?

Yes, it seemed they had gained proper confidence.

Confidence is extremely important for sports players.

Baseball, football, basketball.

In all ball sports, players who lack confidence cannot take bold strategies.

Just as players with strong mental strength can have long careers despite physical or technical shortcomings, Amani, who is continuously building confidence, is sure to become an excellent player.

Of course, his laziness, which is at a level of idleness, still needs to be whipped into shape.

After scoring the opening goal, Amani showed a lot of activity and annoyed Lazio's defense.

Even on the stage of the Europa League final, Amani's breakthroughs continued without much tension.

- Amani! Instantly breaks through Lazio's flank. He seems to be in great form today.

His activity is higher than usual today.

Furthermore, his defensive contributions surprised not only the opponents but his teammates as well.

“If a person suddenly changes, it means they're about to die... I hope that guy doesn't suddenly collapse.” 

“Don't say ominous things.”

In the corner kick situation, Bruno frowned at Lorenzo's words and moved to his spot.

Honestly, I also felt that Amani's play had changed a lot compared to before.

Come to think of it.

Since the second half of the season until now, that guy hasn't skipped basic training while sticking by my side.

Sometimes he would hover around training enthusiasts like Craig and Lorenzo...

It seems the effect is showing now.

This season, Amani recorded 22 goals and 13 assists, showing high efficiency.

He has the third-highest offensive points in Arsenal.

Although his inconsistency due to his young age is a bit regrettable, you can't expect too much from a 19-year-old striker.

If he continues to record such results, he will surely secure a position as a semi-regular at Arsenal.

“Ah!”

And just as I was praising him, Amani got greedy and lost the ball to Lazio's defender.

Cancel everything I said earlier.

This guy is just a lazybones who loses focus as soon as he gets a bit of praise.

- Lazio! Launches a counterattack instantly.

- Fabio Immobile creates space as he moves to the flank! Felipe Pereira is diving into the center.

Lazio's players running with clenched teeth.

The pass from Felipe Pereira, narrowly missing Craig Martin's outstretched foot, connected precisely to Fabio's foot.

Thud!

Fabio didn't miss the opportunity.

The ball left his foot and shook Arsenal's net.

- Gooooooal!

- Fabio Immobile! Scores his 20th goal in the Europa League final!

- Amazing! 20 goals in the Europa League! Fabio shows incredible finishing skills!

It was a perfect counterattack by Lazio.

I approached Amani, who was holding his head in distress, and gave him a light tap on the back of his head and butt.

“Being bold is good, but don't let your guard down.”

“Ugh...”

Seeing him click his tongue in regret, it seemed like he was thinking of attempting such a reckless breakthrough again if given another chance.

It's good to be ambitious.

But even if you're ambitious, I hope you don't play carelessly.

- Despite conceding a goal, Arsenal's momentum is strong.

- The score is back to 1-1. But the overall flow of the game is still in Arsenal's favor.

Still, with Amani causing chaos on the opposite side, I had a bit more freedom to shake up the other flank.

Thanks to that, Lorenzo was continuously creating space in the center by dragging along two of Lazio's defenders, and Bruno and Ødegaard were utilizing that space well.

Whoosh!

- Ah! Another shot narrowly misses!

- Arsenal is gradually increasing their shots! Moreover, the ratio of effective shots is quite high.

- Lazio has no choice but to aim for a counterattack. If they go on the offensive now, Arsenal's attacking line will properly target the empty spaces in Lazio's defense.

Now, since their striker Fabio has scored.

Isn't it my turn to score?

“Pass the ball.”

At my shout, Lorenzo, who was guarding the goal, quickly passed to me and started moving back.

Certainly, I feel my coordination with Lorenzo has been better than with other players lately.

Receiving Lorenzo's pass, I quickly sidestepped Pico Lazzari and moved swiftly to the flank.

- Minho! Carrying the ball forward.

- Lazio's flank is exposed! But there are still two defenders in the center.

- Lorenzo moves to the opposite side, dragging one defender, and Minho attempts a 1-on-1 breakthrough against Francesco Acerbi!

Grabbing the ball steadily despite its irregular bounce, I drove straight into the penalty area.

Avoiding Francesco's outstretched foot, I took a shot.

A slightly curving shot to the left.

The ball curving slightly on a low trajectory.

The ball bounced once on the field, skimmed James Strakosha's gloves, and was sucked into the goal.

Thud!

Yeeeeeessss!

The net shook with the cheers of the Gooners.

As soon as I scored, I slid towards the direction of the Gooners with my arms wide open.

Sssh!

The Gooners kept chanting my name as they watched me.

Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!

Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho! Minho!

- Gooooooal! Minho's 73rd goal of the season! Truly incredible! Truly incredible!

- Ah! This is a truly devastating goal for Lazio. The score is now 2-1 with Arsenal taking the lead again.

Arsenal leading 2-1 again.

Seeing the despair on Lazio's defenders' faces after my goal was clear.

Sorry, but... the game isn't over yet.

To borrow a famous movie quote... Yes.

"It's not over yet."

Ending with just one goal would be too disappointing.

* * *

Lazio's defense was breached.

Of course, Lazio's manager had assessed that it was impossible to completely block Arsenal's attacking line.

So, he planned to hold the first half with just one goal conceded and bet everything on the second half, aiming for a tight score.

He was even considering going into extra time if necessary.

It was unfortunate they conceded at the start of the first half, but when Fabio's fantastic goal brought the score back to 1-1, he thought it was still possible.

However, Arsenal's goal came out soon after.

Mario De Zerbi, the manager, stroked his rough beard deep in thought.

He thought the defenses of both Arsenal and Lazio were similar.

Arsenal's defense, missing its core Tyrone Tierney, was only at an upper-middle level, and it had come this far by covering with its solid midfield and attacking line.

But.

The difference in other parts was too great.

Specifically, the attacking power was vastly different.

It was like Lazio came with a rifle.

While Arsenal showed up with a tank.

That's how formidable Park Minho's presence was.

“Damn bastard.”

He was tough to deal with even when he played at Parma, and he became an even scarier player at Arsenal.

Now it was almost the end of the first half.

Mario, predicting that it would end 2-1, began to quickly think about how to defend in the second half and how to counterattack to make it 2-2.

He thought there was no answer other than going into extra time.

At least, if it went to penalties... he judged that they would have at least a 50% chance of winning.

But.

Contrary to his expectations, Park Minho seemed to have no intention of ending the first half at 2-1.

Waaaaaah!

Suddenly, loud cheers erupted.

When Mario looked up, he saw Park Minho, who had stolen the ball from Lazio at the halfway line, starting to run forward.

Up to that point, it was okay.

Among Park Minho's abilities, his dribbling was one of those that even top defenders couldn't easily block.

The problem was that a player with top-notch speed and the ability to exchange passes had joined his dribbling.

Especially.

Amani Richards, who caused the counterattack, ran like a rabid dog, creating space, and Lorenzo, who penetrated that space, exchanged passes with Park Minho, leading the ball into the danger zone.

“Stop him! Stoooop him!”

Mario screamed in desperation.

But when the ball connected back to Park Minho.

He could only watch in a daze as Park Minho skipped past two players with a step-over.

- Ooooooh! Minhoooooo!

- Minhoooooo! Instantly skips past two players with a step-over!

- It's a crisis for Lazio! Lazio!

- James Strakosha, the goalkeeper, rushes forward to narrow the angle so Minho can't shoot!

- Minhooooo!

Tap!

Even seeing the goalkeeper rushing forward, Park Minho calmly chipped the ball over him.

Then, he sped up to catch the ball that had passed over the goalkeeper and gently pushed it into the net.

- Gooooooal!

- Minhooooo! Continuing his brilliant performance with 2 goals and 1 assist today!

- The score is now 3-1, with Arsenal delivering a near-fatal blow to Lazio just before the end of the first half!

It was an almost perfect play.

Park Minho created the best scene a striker could make with his breakthrough so effortlessly.

Mario De Zerbi was deeply troubled and frustrated by that fact.

“How in the world can we stop that player?”

Even though he was frustrated, he had no choice.

He was a football manager, and there were still 45 minutes left in the game, and he couldn't show a hopeless expression in front of the 11 players looking at him.

In the end, being a professional.

He had no choice but to think of ways to block that monster as much as possible in the remaining time.

* * *

“Super goal! Super sense! Super pass! Super play! Super Minho! Super Arsenal!”

Our half-crazy manager was acting all giddy in front of the players.

The problem was that the players who entered the locker room at the end of the first half were radiating intense energy as if they were inspired by the manager's giddy behavior.

It was embarrassingly so.

“You're going for a hat-trick today, right?”

“I don't know about that. Honestly, if I can score one more goal than their striker, I'll be satisfied.”

Lorenzo grinned at my words.

Don't smile. It makes me attached to you.

“The defense wasn't bad either. Kasper, push forward more aggressively, and Jake, you'll need to work a bit harder.”

“Got it.”

Our manager deployed a modified three-back defense, pushing Kasper Nielsen up high like a midfielder.

Thanks to that, we could outnumber Lazio in midfield battles, maintaining a comfortable possession advantage and making the first half ours.

The second half wouldn't be any different.

Upon hearing the manager's instructions and stepping onto the field, we saw that Lazio had made substitutions.

“The center has changed?”

“That guy used to play for Tottenham.”

“Tank Ndombele?”

Ndombele, who had performed terribly at Tottenham and moved to Lyon on loan and then permanently.

He transferred to Lazio this season, generating a lot of expectations.

Well... the result wasn't great, though.

This guy's mentality is too weak.

Honestly, I think his abilities are overwhelming, but he's lacking the mentality to utilize those abilities... That's why his skills are deteriorating.

Surely, their attempt to build attacks around Ndombele in the second half was sharp, but his consistently low activity and lack of defensive contribution were still major weaknesses.

Rather, the second half felt easier because we could circulate the ball and attack more proactively than in the first half.

- Ah! Ndombele! Loses the ball again!

- Lazio! It seems they intended to turn the tide with Ndombele in the second half... But it seems to be a huge mistake! They are losing midfield dominance more easily than in the first half.

“Minho!”

The first touch in the second half.

As soon as the ball connected to me, Lazio's defense quickly lowered their line and started to be wary.

Now, I have no intention of being satisfied with a 3-1 scoreline.

Since their striker provoked me, shouldn't I at least go for a hat-trick to be satisfied?

Tap!

I slowly pushed the ball forward and moved ahead.

Pico Lazzari, who was thoroughly beaten by me throughout the first half, grumbled with a frown.

“Damn. Just get blocked once.”

I responded by effortlessly outmuscling and bypassing Pico Lazzari.

“Fxxk!”

Pico Lazzari cursed as he slid away in response to my action.

Sorry, but.

I can't let you block me until I get that hat-trick.

I'll let you block me after I score one more.

But... will I be satisfied with just a hat-trick?

Right, I'll score four goals before letting you block me.

No... Five or six goals would be even better, and if I score seven, I might be satisfied.

Hmm... I'll just keep scoring goals and see what happens.

Isn't that right?
