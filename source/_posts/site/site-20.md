## 8. What Can't He Do? (2)

The ball is quickly passed.

The ball is connected to Marjan Kurtić, who was about to turn, and moved up to the opponent's territory.

Marjan Kurtić, positioned in the center, dodged one player and moved forward.

And the ball is passed to the winger.

But his pass failed.

Marjan hurriedly chased the ball, which was intercepted by the opponent, and quickly passed it to me after gaining control.

The opponent's pressure is stronger than expected.

But there was no worry.

I just had to connect the ball to Gennaro Tatis, who was moving according to the agreed pattern.

The problem was that an Ascoli player, agitated by the emotional gap created by the earlier dismissals of one player from each side, made a rough tackle on me.

Screech!

The sharp sound of the grass being scraped.

Instinctively, I turned my body, dribbled the ball, and ran quickly into the empty space.

"Aaah!"

But the opponent was more persistent.

They managed to steal the ball from me with a tackle.

Beep!

However, the opponent received a yellow card for the reckless tackle.

"Ah..."

It hurts quite a bit.

I honestly don't know what grudge they have against me to play so rough.

Boo boo boo!

Ascoli's home fans booed angrily when the yellow card was shown.

"Okay, so that's how it is."

Growing frustration towards Ascoli's players, who are increasingly abandoning teamwork.

Let's show them.

I've been placed in the third line for a while.

Let's play wildly.

* * *

A player was sent off early on.

Both teams' play became rougher.

As a result, the tempo of both teams also became much faster than usual.

The spectators watching this either cheered fervently or jeered loudly with curses whenever a Parma Calcio player got the ball.

The tempo of the game was fast, making the match quite thrilling.

"Hey! Here!"

Gianluca raised his hand high.

After pushing away the opposing midfielder who was sticking to me, I lightly flicked the ball over the head of the defender who was marking Gianluca.

But the attack was blocked again.

Without me, the attacking line seemed somewhat clogged, which was a bit frustrating.

However, thanks to the presence of many hard workers like Gianluca, I could move more freely even while standing in the third line.

So, I need to create something...

My marker does not easily leave me alone.

"Can't you leave me alone for a bit?"

"Sorry, but this is my job."

If you're sorry... just let me go.

I sped up momentarily to shake off my marker and tried to pass forward, but another strong tackle came in.

Screech!

This guy didn't seem afraid of getting sent off, even after receiving a yellow card.

I lightly back-passed and dodged the tackle, and the Ascoli midfielder who tackled me glared at me.

"Stop slipping away like a rat, damn chink."

"Don't get too close. I'm into women."

Well, I said that, but...

It's true that I need to figure something out.

I just need a bit more time.

I decided to keep playing defensively and holding onto the ball until the end of the first half and then make my moves in the second half.

Don't be impatient.

Thinking that way, I spent the time protecting the ball as much as possible.

The referee looked at his watch and blew the whistle.

Finally, it's halftime.

The first half ended like that.

* * *

The players enter the field for the second half.

Standing next to Coach Alain Levagne, who took his seat on the bench again, Assistant Coach Matteo asked worriedly.

"Are you sure this is okay?"

"What is?"

"If the strong pressure continues like in the first half, it will be difficult to build up. Especially, Minho is struggling to adapt in the third line, unlike the second line."

"It's okay."

Yes, it's okay.

Coach Alain Levagne's expression was calm.

"Think about it. How much did the opponent's central players run, and how much more do they have to run in the 45 minutes of the second half?"

"Ah!"

"It's not a game with 10 players on the field. It's a game with 9 players each. There are many gaps on the field..."

"That means..."

"Yes, the more the opponent pressures, the more likely they are to get tired in the second half. At that moment, it will be a good situation for Minho to dominate the game."

Even if Park Minho lacked creativity and adaptability,

He had excellent passing ability and vision.

An obvious but threatening through pass.

The time when that works well.

The period from the 30th to 40th minutes of the second half, when the opponent's legs are heavy, and they cannot cut off that obvious and threatening pass.

That period was the most efficient time for Parma's counterattack.

"Moreover, we are leading 1-0. The opponent is the one in a hurry, and the more urgent they are, the harder they will struggle."

Besides, both teams had already used an early card due to the earlier send-offs.

This meant that Ascoli had no cards to replace the heavily exhausted central players.

"So... let's watch quietly."

Coach Alain Levagne smiled slightly.

"Let's see how Minho hunts the opponent in the third line."

As soon as he finished speaking, Parma Calcio's fantastic counterattack broke out within 5 minutes of the second half.

-Minho's long ball to the left side!

-When did Yann Karamoh get there? He quickly penetrates after receiving the ball!

-Ascoli's defense is breached!

-Yann Karamoh's shot! Ah! Nicola Leali, the goalkeeper! Another super save! Nicola Leali saves Ascoli with his second super save of the match!

A sharp pass.

And the Ascoli central midfielders who couldn't intercept it.

Finally, the unfortunate shot by Yann Karamoh.

Seeing all these combined elements, Coach Alain Levagne quickly called up Valentin Mihăilă, who was warming up.

Coach Alain Levagne of Parma Calcio quickly decided on the player to be substituted in the 30th minute of the second half.

Unlike the Ascoli coach, who was staring blankly at the field.

"Huff... Huff!"

Ascoli's central midfielder.

Fabbrizio Callegara, who was marking Park Minho, was catching his rough breath.

But he had no time to rest.

"Again?"

Park Minho, who had the ball, quickly penetrated Ascoli's territory, not giving him a moment's rest.

At the same time, he penetrated between the defenders with a 2-on-1 pass with another player, making it harder to stop him.

Having enjoyed watching the EPL in the past, Fabbrizio recalled someone while watching Park Minho's changed play style.

A player from Chelsea, who was called a midfield striker.

"Fucking bastard."

He clearly won in physical battles.

And his activity was much higher.

But.

From the moment it passed the 10th minute of the second half, it became increasingly difficult to catch up with that damn Asian.

In fact, he knew well.

With only 9 players on the field, he was running more than usual.

As a result, it was difficult to control the pace, and his stamina was draining fast.

'But this is not right.'

Yes, no matter how much he ran.

That damn Asian, who usually played 60-70 minutes in each match, shouldn't be so hard to catch.

But why?

Why is that obvious pass, which he tried to cut off, passing right in front of him and reaching the opponent's striker?

And twice in a row, no less.

-Yann Karamoh has the ball again!

-He’s fast! Similar course to before! Similar pattern! It's dangerous again!

-Yann Karamoh shoots! No! It's a pass! A pass! Yann Karamoh's pass to Minho, who penetrated the center!

-Minho lightly passes it back to Gennaro Tatis, and he shoots!

-Goooooal! Parma extends the lead to 2-0 with a decisive goal.

-Oh! Ascoli! It's not easy. If it was 1-0, they could think of a comeback... But this goal in the 12th minute of the second half deeply wounds Ascoli's hopes!

"Damn it!"

A rough curse burst out.

Fabbrizio clenched his fist tightly as he watched that damn Asian, who had successfully penetrated between the defenders and recorded an assist.

But even as he watched the scene blankly, his rough breathing did not ease.

* * *

See that?

Just a little play, and their legs are already shaking.

What's the point of running a lot?

You have to run efficiently.

If you ask why I seem so sharp, it's because the opponent started it first... that's what I would say.

Anyway.

The opponent can't stop my simple pass from earlier.

A killer pass that breaks through the defense if successful.

But too simple and predictable.

Even with such a pass.

The opponent's legs are too tired to follow.

Moreover, they underestimated my stamina.

Just because I played 60-70 minutes every match.

They thought I lacked stamina.

But it's only been a little over 2 months since I turned pro.

Isn't it too much to assume I still lack stamina?

Thanks to that, from a little over 15 minutes into the second half, I was sure I had complete control of the center.

Screech!

"Aaah!"

Beep!

Well, because the opponent's legs are tired, they make a lot more rough tackles to stop me.

But it gave an opportunity.

A free-kick chance near the danger area.

1 goal 1 assist... I want to score one more.

Winning 3-0 feels much better than 2-0, right?

It's not my first free-kick since turning pro.

But it still feels like the first.

Well, it's true that there weren't many opportunities for free-kicks.

A lot of fans think I could be good at free-kicks if they look at my passes and shots.

Yes.

I’m pretty good at free-kicks.

Even in high school, my free-kicks were as good as those of other talented players.

In the last training session, I scored 8 out of 10.

This was a talent I developed myself without imitating other players.

As Ascoli's players lined up for the wall.

After preparing for the free-kick and slowly stepping back, the referee blew the whistle.

"Whew..."

Taking a deep breath, I quickly ran towards the ball and swung my left foot wide.

Boom!

The ball curled quickly and got sucked in.

Seeing the ball curl sharply to the top right corner of the goal, I was sure.

It’s a goal.

Thud!

-Gooooal!

-Minho's second goal! And his 8th goal of the season! His 6th goal in the league! A fantastic free-kick goal!

-The score is now 3-0! Ascoli is now in despair with a gap that is hard to close!

I spread my arms wide in celebration.

But strangely, no one approached me.

Curious about the reason, I turned around and saw that another Ascoli player was having a heated argument again.

That guy had provocatively made a racist remark to me earlier...

Fortunately, nothing more happened.

My goal wasn't canceled.

That foolish guy lost focus for the rest of the match and eventually got sent off for another rough tackle.

He became the third player to be sent off in today's match.

Because of that, Ascoli's home fans were furious, and around the 40th minute of the second half, flares were set off.

Cough cough!

Oh! The smoke is really choking.

Thankfully, there wasn't much time left, so I didn't have to breathe in that terrible smoke for long.

After the game, another reporter approached me.

Could it be... MVP again today?

* * *

[A fierce battle with 3 send-offs! The winner is Parma Calcio with a 3-0 score!]

[Minho's 2 goals and 1 assist! A fantastic performance! Shining in both the second and third lines!]

[What can't he do? Korea's national team coach Pedro smiles brightly at Park Minho's stellar performance!]

[Definitive ball carrying and bold penetration in the danger area from the third line! Minho was like 'Lampard'!]

[3 consecutive MVPs! Where is Minho's limit?]

[A player perfect at free-kicks too? Parma Calcio fans are deeply in love with Minho.]

It was indeed a bit exaggerated.

But Coach Pedro could fully understand their feelings.

Park Minho's performance was that fantastic.

As one article title suggested, Coach Pedro was curious.

"What can't he do?"

What could this player possibly not do?

Wondering about that, Coach Pedro quickly wrote down Park Minho's name in the national team call-up list.
