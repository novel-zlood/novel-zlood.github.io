## 8. What Can't He Do? (2)

The ball was quickly passed.

Marjan Kurtić received the ball as he was about to turn his body and advanced into the opponent's side.

Marjan Kurtić, positioned in the center, dodged one player and moved forward.

And the ball was passed to the winger.

But his pass failed.

Marjan, who quickly chased the ball that bounced off the opponent's cut, grabbed the ball and hastily connected it to me.

The opponent's pressure is stronger than I thought.

But there was no worry.

Because I just needed to pass the ball to Gennaro Tatis, who was moving in the promised pattern.

The problem was that the Ascoli player, who was agitated by the emotional rift created by the previous ejection of each other's players, came at me with a rough tackle.

Swoosh!

The sharp sound of grass being scraped.

I reflexively turned my body, dragged the ball, and quickly ran into the empty space.

“Aaah!”

But the opponent was more persistent.

In the end, he tackled me and took the ball away.

Beep!

But since the opponent also made an unreasonable tackle, he had no choice but to receive a yellow card.

“Aow…”

It hurts quite a bit.

I honestly don't know what grudge he holds against me to play so rough.

Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo!

Ascoli's home fans booed loudly and got angry when the yellow card was given.

“Okay, so that's how you're going to play.”

I felt increasingly dissatisfied with the Ascoli players who were abandoning their sense of camaraderie.

Let's show them.

I've been placed in the third line for a while.

Let's go wild and have some fun.

* * *

A player was sent off early in the game.

The play of both teams became rougher.

As a result, the tempo of both teams was much faster than usual.

The spectators watching cheered loudly or booed and cursed whenever a Parma Calcio player had the ball.

As the tempo of the game was fast, the excitement level of the game was quite high.

“Hey! Over here!”

Gianluca raised his hand high.

He used his body to push away the opponent midfielder who was sticking close to me, then lightly flicked the ball over the head of the defender sticking to Gianluca.

But the attack was blocked again.

Indeed, the attack line seemed somewhat clogged without me, which was a bit frustrating.

However, thanks to the many hard workers like Gianluca, I could move a bit more freely even though I was in the third line.

So, I needed to create something...

My marker wouldn't leave me alone.

“Can't you leave me alone for a bit?”

“Sorry, but this is my job.”

If you're sorry... then let me go.

I momentarily sped up to shake off my marker and tried to pass forward, but a strong tackle came in again.

Swoosh!

This guy didn't seem afraid of getting another yellow card and being sent off.

I lightly back-passed and avoided the tackle, and the Ascoli midfielder who tackled me growled while looking at me.

“Stop slipping away like a rat, you damn chink.”

“Don't stick too close. I'm into girls.”

Well, I said that, but it's true I need to figure something out.

But I still needed a little more time.

I planned to hold out until the end of the first half and start moving in earnest in the second half.

Let's not be hasty.

Thinking that way, I spent the time trying to hold onto the ball as much as possible.

The referee looked at his watch and blew the whistle.

Finally, it was halftime.

The first half ended like that.

* * *

The players entering the field for the second half.

Matteo, the assistant coach, stood next to head coach Alain Lavagne, who was back on the bench, and asked worriedly.

“Will this be okay?”

“What?”

“If the strong pressure continues like in the first half, it will be difficult to build up play. Especially since Minho is having trouble adapting to the third line compared to the second line.”

“It's okay.”

Yes, it's okay.

Head coach Alain Lavagne's expression was calm.

“Just think about it. How much has the opponent's center run, and how much more do they have to run for the remaining 45 minutes of the second half?”

“Ah!”

“It's not a game with ten players on the field. It's a game with nine players each. That means there are many holes on the field...”

“Which means...”

“Yes, the more they press us hard... the more likely they are to get tired in the second half. From that moment, it will be an ideal situation for Minho to dominate the game.”

Even though Park Minho lacked creativity and versatility.

He had excellent passing ability and vision.

Obvious but threatening through passes.

The time when they work well.

The time when the opponent's legs are heavy, and they can't cut off those obvious and threatening passes, is in the 30-40 minutes of the second half.

That time was the most efficient time for a counterattack for Parma.

“Moreover, we are winning 1-0. The team in a hurry is the opponent, and the more anxious they are, the more they will struggle.”

Furthermore, both teams had used up their cards early due to the ejections.

Ascoli didn't have a card to replace the heavily exhausted central players.

“So... let's quietly watch.”

Head coach Alain Lavagne smiled slightly.

“Let's see how Minho hunts the opponent from the third line.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a fantastic counterattack by Parma Calcio occurred within five minutes of the second half.

-Minho's long pass goes to the left side!

-When did Yann Karamoh get there? He grabs the ball and quickly penetrates!

-Ascoli, who let him into the danger zone!

-Yann Karamoh shoots! Ah! Goalkeeper Nicola Leali! Another super save! Nicola Leali saves Ascoli again today with his second super save of the match!

A sharp pass.

And the central midfielders of Ascoli, who couldn't cut off and missed the pass.

Lastly, Yann Karamoh's regrettable shot.

Having confirmed all these complex factors, head coach Alain Lavagne quickly called Valentin Mihăilă, who was warming up.

Parma Calcio's head coach Alain Lavagne quickly decided on the player to be introduced in the 30th minute of the second half.

Unlike Ascoli's head coach, who was staring blankly at the field.

“Huff... Huff!”

Ascoli's central midfielder.

Fabrizio Calagara, who was marking Park Minho, was catching his rough breath.

But.

He had no time to rest.

‘Again?’

Park Minho, who had the ball, quickly penetrated Ascoli's territory, not giving him a chance to rest.

At the same time, as he passed the ball in a 2-on-1 situation with other players and penetrated between the defenders, it became more difficult to stop him.

Fabrizio, who had enjoyed watching EPL in the past, thought of someone while watching Park Minho's changed play style.

The player from Chelsea who was called a "midfield striker."

“Damn it.”

Certainly, he won the physical battles.

And his activity level was much higher.

But.

From the moment the 10th minute of the second half passed, it became strangely difficult to catch up with that damn Asian.

He knew it well.

Since only nine players were on the field, he was traversing the field much more than usual.

As a result, it was not easy to control the tempo, and his stamina was quickly depleting.

‘But this is too much.’

Okay, even if he ran a lot.

It didn't mean he couldn't catch up with that damn Asian who played 60-70 minutes every game.

But why?

Why are the obvious passes he's trying to cut passing right in front of him and reaching the opponent's attackers?

And that too, twice in a row.

-Yann Karamoh has the ball again!

-He’s quick! Similar course! Similar pattern! It's dangerous again this time!

-Yann Karamoh shoots! No! Passes! Passes! Yann Karamoh's pass goes to Minho, who penetrates the center!

-Minho lightly passes the ball back to Gennaro Tatis, and he shoots!

-Gooaaaal! Parma extends their lead to 2-0 with a decisive goal.

-Ah! Ascoli! It's not easy. If it were 1-0, they could think of a comeback... But the goal in the 12th minute of the second half hits Ascoli's heart hard!

“Damn it!”

A rough curse burst out.

Fabrizio clenched his fist as he looked at that damn Asian who succeeded in penetrating the defense and recorded an assist.

But even in the situation where he was staring blankly at that scene, his rough breathing didn't seem to stop.

* * *

Look.

Just playing a bit and their legs are already trembling.

What's the point of running a lot?

You have to run efficiently.

If you ask why I seem so sharp, it's because the opponent started the fight first... I can answer like that.

Anyway.

The opponent hasn't been able to block my simple passes since a while ago.

Killer passes that break through the defense if successful.

But too simple to anticipate.

Even though it's such a pass.

The opponent's legs are too tired to chase.

Moreover, they underestimated my stamina.

They must have thought I lacked stamina because I played 60-70 minutes every game.

It's quite unfair to think I still lack stamina when I only turned pro a little over two months ago.

Thanks to that, I was confident that I had completely taken control of the central area from slightly over 15 minutes into the second half.

Swoosh!

“Aagh!”

Beep!

Well, because the opponent's legs were tired, more rough tackles came in to stop me.

But thanks to that, I got an opportunity.

A free-kick chance near the danger area.

1 goal and 1 assist... I want to score one more goal.

Winning 3-0 feels much better than winning 2-0, right?

It's not my first free-kick since debuting professionally, but it still feels like the first.

Well, I didn't get many free-kick opportunities.

Many fans expect me to be good at free-kicks, considering my passes and shots.

That's right.

I'm pretty good at free-kicks.

Even in high school, I wasn't behind other talented players in free-kicks.

In the last training, I scored 8 out of 10.

This was a talent I developed by myself without imitating other players.

The Ascoli players lined up to form a wall.

I got ready for the free-kick and slowly stepped back as the referee blew his whistle.

“Hoo...”

I took a deep breath and quickly ran towards the ball, swinging my left foot wide.

Bang!

The ball quickly curved and was sucked in.

Seeing the ball curve greatly into the upper right corner of the goal, I was sure.

It's a goal.

Thud!

-Gooaaaal!

-Minho's multi-goal! And his 8th goal of the season! His 6th league goal! It's a fantastic free-kick goal!

-With this, the score is now 3-0! Ascoli falls into despair with a score they can no longer easily catch up with!

As I spread my arms wide in celebration.

Strangely, no one approached me.

Curious about the reason, I turned around and saw another player from Ascoli arguing heatedly.

That guy was the fool who made a racist remark to provoke me earlier...

Fortunately, nothing serious happened.

My goal wasn't canceled.

That foolish guy eventually played distractedly for the remaining time and was sent off for a rough tackle.

He became the third player to be sent off in today's game.

Maybe that's why, but the Ascoli home fans were very angry, and flares went off slightly over 40 minutes into the second half.

Cough, cough!

Wow! The smoke is very thick.

Fortunately, there wasn't much time left, so I didn't have to inhale that thick smoke much longer.

After the game ended, a reporter came to find me again.

Could it be... Am I the MVP again today?

* * *

[A bloody battle with three players sent off! The winner is Parma Calcio with a 3-0 score!]

[Minho's 2 goals and 1 assist! A fantastic performance! He shined not only on the second line but also on the third line!]

[What can't he do? Park Minho's exceptional performance brings a big smile to South Korea's national team coach Pedro!]

[Definite ball carrying and bold penetration in the danger area from the third line! Minho was like 'Lampard'!]

[Three consecutive MVPs! Where are Minho's limits?]

[A perfect player even at free-kicks? Parma Calcio fans are head over heels for Minho.]

Certainly, the praise was overdone.

But coach Pedro could fully understand their feelings.

Park Minho's performance was fantastic.

Just like the title of one article, coach Pedro was curious.

“What can't he do?”

Indeed, what can’t this player do?

Wondering about that, coach Pedro quickly wrote down Park Minho's name on the national team call-up list.
