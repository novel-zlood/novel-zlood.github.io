## 48. Another Victory! (1)

After securing the league title...

You could feel the weight of the burden that had been tormenting the team slightly lift at the training ground.

Seeing the players training with bright smiles was truly a joy to behold.

Well... I could indirectly gauge that the stress had significantly decreased by seeing our coach's receding hairline slightly moving forward.

It was May after the victory against Brentford.

Finally, you could feel the end of the season approaching.

The end of the season always has a unique feeling.

And then came the first leg of the Europa League semifinals.

In this match held at Emirates Stadium on May 2, we achieved a 5-0 victory thanks to my hat-trick.

Our opponent, PSV Eindhoven, appeared more powerless than expected, recording a massive defeat.

Honestly, I expected a tough match, but unexpectedly, PSV's performance wasn't good.

- They are really strong! Arsenal's performance is on fire these days!

- There were many close matches in April, but in May, they crushed PSV.

- PSV is also a formidable opponent... I never dreamed Arsenal would change this much.

- We are going to the Rasdan in Armenia!

- Un! Beatable! Ar! Senal!

- Can't compare to those X-like Spurs!

Or is it that PSV is the same as usual, but we got stronger?

The fans seemed to think so.

After easily winning the first leg against PSV, we went on to win 3-0 against Burnley in the 35th round of the league with half of our main players rested.

Lorenzo, who came on in the second half, scored 2 goals.

In the late second half, Ã˜degaard's sealing goal also came as Burnley was swept away, ending the match.

Looking at this, it might be true that Arsenal has changed.

Contrary to Arsenal's winning streak, our rival Tottenham is stuck in the mud.

[16th in the league! 2 points ahead of relegation zone Palace!]

[What happened to Tottenham, who was 9th in the league last season?]

[Tottenham's aging defense is the problem! Both main defenders are 35 years old!]

[Relegation to be decided in the last match!]

[Arsenal fans mock Spurs struggling in the relegation zone! Provocative banners in London say 'Spurs! How's the air down there? It's refreshing up here!']

[London police remove banners within 2 hours!]

Just 2 points ahead of 18th place Palace.

Monica was the happiest about the fact that Tottenham could fall into the relegation zone if they lose.

At the same time, in Korea, people seemed to admire Junseo hyung's foresight, who transferred to Man Utd this season.

There were all sorts of mockery saying that Harriet Kane also avoided the bomb.

As the season approached its end, things that were previously unseen came into view.

Especially, there was a bittersweet feeling about Serie A news.

[Parma finishes 10th in the league!]

[Kenez Marcetico's efforts not enough to secure a Europa Conference League spot!]

[Kenez records 19 goals and 3 assists in the league! Attracts interest from various European clubs!]

It was disappointing that Parma's results weren't good.

Of course, I knew well that this result was the limit given Parma's financial power.

Last season, we continued to achieve good results with promising players who had their potential burst, and I led the way with my goals. But this season, Kenez had to take responsibility for scoring alone, leading to frequent comebacks or ties.

Still, the performance wasn't bad, so I heard that Parma fans were moderately satisfied.

Roberto also nodded his head, saying, "Considering many players aside from a few were sold off, finishing 10th in the league isn't a bad result!"

Our cheeky Santiago, who was sold to Ajax, showed even more growth by recording 8 goals and 7 assists in the league.

He often contacted me, confidently saying, "Minho! I'll show the power of the next Messi in the Champions League."

Hmm... I don't know about being the next Messi.

Honestly, seeing his recent performance reminds me of Riquelme, as he is leading Ajax on his own.

Comparing him to Riquelme might be a stretch due to his frequent mistakes, inconsistency, and different style. But the influence he shows in the central second line is comparable to Riquelme.

Santiago was achieving more growth in the team called Ajax.

"Champions League..."

I am looking forward to it.

The only continental cup competition I experienced since my professional debut was the Europa League.

At the same time, this thought came to mind.

To make a proper first step in the Champions League next season, we must neatly finish this season.

* * *

[Arsenal wins 5-1 against Leeds!]

[Who can stop Arsenal? Arsenal wins 2-0 in the second leg against PSV!]

[Arsenal advances to the Europa League final!]

[1-1 draw against Chelsea! Minho's last goal narrowly secures a draw!]

[Arsenal has only 3 matches left!]

[Arsenal aims to win all remaining 3 matches!]

There are only 3 matches left in the season.

The last league match against Watford.

The FA Cup final against Bournemouth.

Lastly, the Europa League final against Lazio.

These three matches remain.

Except for Lazio, there aren't any particularly tough opponents, but football is a sport where unexpected variables can arise anytime, so we always have to be cautious.

Watford was already confirmed to be relegated, so I didn't think it would be a tough match.

The problem was the FA Cup final against Bournemouth.

[Bournemouth wins Championship League!]

[Bournemouth aims to win both promotion and FA Cup!]

[Loan player Dane Scarlett from Tottenham! Can he lead Bournemouth to victory against Arsenal?]

- Stupid journalist! Does he think that a lousy prospect from Spurs can score against the strongest Arsenal?

- He'll be thrashed by Craig and leave the field in tears.

- Bournemouth has no eye for talent. Taking a dumb striker from Spurs on loan.

Bournemouth, who won the Championship League and succeeded in promotion, aimed to win the FA Cup and advance to a continental cup competition.

Naturally, the atmosphere in their squad was quite high.

And giant-killing usually happens in such an atmosphere.

How did we crush the strong teams in Serie A and win the league during my time at Parma?

It was thanks to maintaining the momentum built from Serie B into the next season.

Bournemouth also had enough momentum to cause an upset.

Of course, preparing well for the last league match against Watford was important. Only one match remained for an undefeated season.

And then came the away match against Watford.

Even before entering the field, the atmosphere at Vicarage Road was far from good.

With relegation to the Championship League confirmed, the home fans' boos were directed not at the Arsenal squad but at the Watford players they supported, indicating the poor atmosphere.

"Win the last league match to ensure an undefeated season. Got it?"

"The great Minho has given his divine command! The Watford match must be a high-scoring game! Got it, you X-like slaves?"

"Woahhhhhhhh!"

The squad, slightly relaxed for the last league match, used me as a subject of their jokes.

I was called a god at Parma, and now I am called a god at Arsenal.

Such a tremendous nickname doesn't burden me.

I just think it's good if the team wins.

Personal records naturally follow when you focus on the team's victory.

Lorenzo quietly approached and mentioned the record.

"You'll record more attacking points than last season."

"Despite scoring so many goals, I'm still 5 goals short of Messi's single-season scoring record, and I haven't even come close to the 79 club goals in a year."

"That's because Messi is a god. Well... Minho, you'll soon surpass that god's record too."

"Because I'm a god?"

"That's right."

With such high evaluation...

How could I only think about myself?

I just have to work hard and repay with my skills.

Now, it's time to enter the field.

Lined up in the tunnel before entering, we faced Watford players.

Seeing the expressions on Watford players' faces wasn't good.

They knew well that the boos from their home fans were directed at them, not us, which is why their faces were stiff.

Still, hearing the voices of a few home fans encouraging them to run madly to stop our undefeated season indicated that they weren't just being cursed at.

As soon as we entered the field, the chants of the Gooners who followed us to the Watford away game could be heard.

The chant they let out was strangely addictive.

- Even Southampton is going to the Champions League!

- Spurs can't go!

- Even Southampton is going to the Champions League!

- Man Utd can't go!

- We are going! We are going! We are going!

A really childish chant.

The problem is that this childish content sticks to your mouth and makes you follow along.

Ah! Southampton finally pulled Man Utd down to 5th place in the league and finished 4th.

Regardless of the last match's result.

Thanks to that, Man Utd fans' anger was directed at the manager and Ronaldo.

When Monica heard the news... I saw her open an expensive wine she had been saving.

Not to drink, but to pour into the bathtub and shower with it, which was shocking.

Spending millions to shower with wine.

Sometimes I think Monica is truly something else.

"Minho, did you drink last night?"

"Why?"

"Well... it seems like your body smells like wine. Did you change to a fruity shampoo?"

Sniff sniff... I don't smell anything.

I don't know what this guy is fussing about some smell.

I clearly cleaned up before entering the locker room.

* * *

Watford had no great expectations.

No, they didn't even have proper motivation.

They were just waiting for relegation.

That was the reality of Watford.

"Block! Block it!"

"Boooooo!"

"You X-like guys! Why can't you properly block that one Asian guy and keep getting beaten on the flank?"

But no player in the Watford squad wanted to keep playing while being cursed at by fans.

So, even though they tried to raise their spirits to win at least the last match, that spirit quickly dwindled against Arsenal's fierce attack.

- Minho! Grabs the ball and runs! Quickly passes two players and connects it to Lorenzo!

- Return! Minho! Grabs the ball again and shoots! Gooooooal!

- Minoooooo! Scores his 45th league goal!

The opening goal scored in just 14 minutes of the first half.

Watford players looked at Park Minho with a stunned expression and then lowered their heads.

Of course, this wasn't the end.

Park Minho actively participated in defense, taking away any chance Watford had of a comeback.

Seeing a player who significantly contributes to the team's goals also actively participate in defense, even Watford home fans shook their heads in disbelief.

A performance by a forward who had already scored 45 league goals was naturally not over.

He eventually contributed to other players' goals, quickly recording 2 goals and 2 assists.

In the 20th minute of the second half.

Watching Park Minho slowly leave the field, the Gooners who followed us to the away match screamed in near hysteria.

Whistle! Wheeeet! Wheeeeeet!

And after all the time passed.

Finally, the last league match ended.

- Arsenal! Secures the league title for the first time in 20 years since the 03-04 season! Confirming an undefeated season!

- Arsenal! Amazing! Arsenal! They achieve the tremendous feat of returning to the throne after 20 years!

At the moment Arsenal's undefeated season was confirmed.

Coach Alain Levagne and Arsenal players ran around the field savoring the joy of the undefeated season.
