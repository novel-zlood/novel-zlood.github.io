## 24. Qatar World Cup (1)

Since I provoked Juventus.

It was natural for football fans in Torino to have ill feelings toward me.

However, not everyone was dissatisfied.

Other Italian football fans who disliked Juventus were celebrating and chattering away.

Especially the two teams from Milan, who seemed to have seized the opportunity to relish in taunting Juventus fans.

"Minho is like a devil."

"Really?"

"But sometimes, he seems like a fool."

Yeah, sorry for being a fool.

This lazy guy.

Recently, he had been slacking off in training, so I had scheduled extra sessions from yesterday and pushed him hard, and now he was sulking and grumbling.

"Ah! By the way, Minho! Did you hear about that?"

"Hear about what?"

"They say our coach might go to Arsenal?"

What nonsense is that?

I was momentarily stunned.

Surprised, I searched the internet and the first news I saw was that Arsenal's coach, Kike Arteta, had been sacked.

And.

Below that was an article explaining why Arsenal wanted our coach.

So, I read it.

Why Arsenal wanted our coach.

It was because they were nostalgic for the past.

Like Arsène Wenger, he's French.

He's consistently achieved results in the league.

Moreover, he enjoys using young players.

Of course, his tactics and the fact that he's losing hair are not the same, but in other aspects, he is quite similar.

Even I could see some resemblances.

But Arsenal fans are quite something.

The same fans who demanded Arsène Wenger's resignation are now looking for a similar French coach, which is rather ironic.

Anyway.

Parma’s board members were anxious that our coach might leave.

They should have treated him better all along.

Parma always fixes the barn after losing the cow.

The same goes for my buyout clause.

And for the replacements for the players who left.

Parma seemed more focused on making money rather than thinking about how to use it efficiently.

Fortunately, despite such news, my teammates didn’t show signs of mental instability.

Instead, they seemed more concerned about which strong team to mess with next.

Hmm...

I don't know who they learned it from, but they learned well.

I'm satisfied.

Truly satisfied.

October 27.

Red Star came to our home ground.

And we showed them the kind of football they intended to show us in the first match.

Of course, they were overjoyed.

I watched from the bench.

Even without me, the team won 1-0.

Our coach seemed to have discovered a new tactic recently.

Despite using a full rotation, it was our first time overwhelming the opponent and winning 1-0.

Parma's home fans naturally taunted the visiting Red Star fans.

That's what football is about.

Home fans taunting the opposition.

Of course, the opposite can also happen.

Two days later.

We had no time to rest.

We faced AC Milan at home.

The full rotation in the Red Star match was for this game.

Hearing the fans’ chants for Parma echoing through the tunnel made me smile.

"Let's beat the Rossoneri to a pulp."

“Mahabanyabaramil…”

“After today's match, let's grill some lamb.”

“Wanna go out tomorrow?”

One guy was excitedly badmouthing Milan.

Another was chanting a Buddhist scripture.

One was talking about grilling meat after the match.

Another was suggesting going to a club tomorrow.

The Parma players seemed like a ragtag bunch, but they trained hard, so I didn’t see it as a problem.

More importantly, Milan was using a near-second-string rotation against us.

I understood it was because of their tight October schedule, but it still felt infuriating.

Of course, they had to go all out against Atlético Madrid before facing us.

Moreover, AC Milan’s Champions League Group B, consisting of Milan, Liverpool, Atlético Madrid, and Shakhtar, was a 'Group of Death.'

Fortunately, they won as much as they invested and succeeded in advancing to the Champions League Round of 16.

However, they would pay the price.

Without Bruno Campos, Daniele Tonali, and Vito Kjær, Milan had no reason to scare us.

- Minhooooo! An incredible goooal!

- A fantastic scissor kick! AC Milan concedes two goals to Parma within 20 minutes of the first half!

In the first 20 minutes, AC Milan was hit hard.

Ibrahim Kessie, placed in the center, couldn’t handle Parma’s strong pressure alone.

Thanks to that, we scored two goals quickly.

And I scored one of them.

"Parma! Parma! Parma!"

"Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho!"

"Great! Let's score one more!"

The enthusiastic chants of the fans were overwhelming.

The expressions of the confident Milan players darkened.

Parma finished the first half with a 3-0 lead.

And the second half was no different.

We showed consistent performance.

Even though Milan hurriedly brought in striker Nisolaou Leão, they couldn’t score a single goal.

Instead, they conceded another goal.

In a corner kick situation.

I scored by pushing through Milan’s defenders to meet Santiago’s corner kick.

The ball perfectly reached my head at the right timing, changing its trajectory and shaking the net.

- Minhooooo!

- A multi-goooal in today's match!

- AC Milan collapses! The difference is evident between Parma, who used a full rotation to save their main players' energy in the Europa League, and Milan, who couldn't!

Two consecutive goals in today’s match.

And that wasn’t the end.

In the 31st minute of the second half, my clean through pass was neatly converted by Filippo Asnelli, extending the score to 5-0.

The shocked Milan away fans.

They started leaving the stands before the match ended.

No matter how mean-spirited I am, I wouldn’t provoke fans like that.

As I calmly returned to my position, the lazy guy looked at me with eyes saying, ‘What’s gotten into him?’

Why are you looking at me like that?

I do have consideration for others, you know.

Well, honestly, provoking an opponent we crushed 5-0 with the same intensity as against Juventus might get me shot, so I gave up.

Usually, provoking is more fun when you win narrowly.

Winning overwhelmingly like this just feels bittersweet.

* * *

While I was focusing on Serie A, the group draw for the 2022 Qatar World Cup was completed.

The results were truly shocking.

I sighed as soon as I saw the results.

2022 Qatar World Cup Group H.

- Netherlands

- South Korea

- Morocco

- France

According to the World Cup draw regulations, except for Europe, the other continental countries must be grouped with at least two European countries and two countries from other continents.

"But why the Netherlands and France?"

Moreover, we couldn’t underestimate Morocco, as most of their key players were active in Europe.

Recognized as one of the two powerhouses of North Africa along with Algeria, they were a formidable team, making the draw even more daunting.

Naturally, the atmosphere in Korea was not good.

It was France and the Netherlands.

- Group H level lololol

- 3 losses and group stage elimination confirmed lololol

- Wow lol, how can they draw such a group?

- France, Netherlands, and even African powerhouse Morocco in one group?

- Should we give up on this World Cup?

- It's bleak lololol

The atmosphere couldn't help but be bad.

I was a bit worried too.

France was the defending champion.

We had to be cautious.

The Netherlands had failed to qualify for the last tournament but had many outstanding players currently playing in Europe’s top leagues, so it was uncertain.

Moreover, they had a history of alternating success and failure.

If they fell in the last tournament, they would perform incredibly in the next, so we had to be careful.

Japan also faced tough opponents.

Spain and Uruguay.

And Wales.

They also had difficult opponents.

Thanks to that, Japan's mood wasn't great either.

Anyway.

The Qatar World Cup felt closer.

It was the last World Cup with 32 participating countries.

Naturally, it drew a lot of attention.

Soon, the final 23-man World Cup squad was announced.

Most of the expected players were called up.

I was also one of those 23.

My mother contacted me.

She saw me on the news and said, 'For the first time, you felt like a real football player.'

It was my first World Cup, so I was a bit worried.

I wanted to reach the Round of 16, but it didn’t feel easy.

A few days later.

The lazy guy was jumping with joy.

And he was incredibly happy throughout the training.

"I can't believe I get to play in the World Cup with Messi! Hahaha!"

Santiago had been called up to the Argentina national team.

Apparently, this World Cup was the last chance to see both Messi and Ronaldo, so he was even happier.

There weren't many players from our team called up to their national teams.

Just Santiago, Jordan Osorio for the Colombian national team, and me.

Most of the players were between 18 and 22 years old, so they were too young to be called up to their national teams.

The other players were either past their prime or had strong competitors in their national teams.

With the match against Napoli scheduled for early November moved to December 31, we had to play the last match of the Europa League Group H stage first.

The opponent was LASK Linz.

We finished the first half of the season with a clean 8-0 victory at their home ground.

"Minho! Don't get injured and come back safely."

Our coach, who wasn’t usually like this, looked at me with teary eyes before sending me off to Qatar.

He’s been looking at me more sentimentally these days.

"Minho! Score lots of goals in the World Cup!"

"Show those French guys what you're made of!"

"But our coach is French too?"

"Then show them half of what you're made of!"

With my teammates’ send-off, I boarded the plane to South Korea.

* * *

It was the first World Cup held in winter.

Even though it was still November in South Korea, it was quite chilly.

The cold was incomparable to Italy.

Upon arriving in Korea, I heard some noise about the final 23-man World Cup squad.

The inclusion of an 18-year-old central midfielder was the reason.

I didn’t care much about the age.

As long as you play well, that’s all that matters.

Moreover, I had seen Park Sangbin, who was first selected for the senior national team at the age of 19.

In that sense, the youngest player included in the final squad had considerable talent.

Training with the players at Paju NFC, I was impressed by the youngest player’s sense.

I smiled, thinking he might be the future of the national team.

I didn’t understand why the media was making such a fuss.

I could see why Coach Pedro looked suddenly aged.

He looked quite different from when I first saw him.

I should never become a coach.

If I age like that, Monica will be sad.

I must never do it.

“Minho! Let’s go eat.”

“Yes, hyung.”

Recently, I started calling Shin Joonseo hyung.

Joonseo hyung, whom I hadn't seen in a while, didn’t look well.

Tottenham had been struggling a lot.

Competing with Arsenal in mid-table must be frustrating.

Even Monica, who usually changes the channel immediately when Arsenal is on TV, was serious.

Tottenham, being in the same North London area, was showing a similar form to Arsenal.

Both teams' managers were sacked, and they were playing the season with interim managers.

"Is Tottenham really that bad?"

"The team atmosphere is not good either."

Due to Tottenham's continued struggles, Joonseo hyung was considering leaving the team.

"Persistent failures to win trophies have shaken the players."

"Plus, with the constant change in managers and tactics, it's hard to adapt."

"Honestly, I want to win a trophy too."

Despite being Korea's top striker, hyung had never lifted a proper trophy.

He was so envious when he heard that I lifted the Coppa Italia trophy last season.

Sometimes, I felt a bit sorry for him.

“For now, I’ll think about it until the end of this season.”

Though he said that.

Hyung seemed to have made up his mind to leave.

“Well, what can we do? We just have to work hard.”

Hyung nodded at my words.

The only thing I could say was to work hard.

Who knows?

If he performs exceptionally well in the World Cup... maybe a top club close to winning might offer big money to sign him.

So, he has to work his ass off.

That's the way a professional survives.
