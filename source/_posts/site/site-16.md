## 6. National Team? Me? Why? (3)

- Ah! The match ends!

- The friendly match against Oman concludes with South Korea losing 1-0.

- Ah... The performance was really good, but the lack of finishing ultimately held us back.

- This needs to be addressed. Except for Shin Junseo, there isn't a reliable scorer, which is very dangerous.

- Still, Park Minho really stood out, didn't he?

- That's right. Park Minho, who played during the first 45 minutes, was really good. A lot of opportunities were created while he was on the field.

It was the worst match.

After conceding a goal from a single counterattack,

South Korea kept missing good opportunities.

Some might say,

"Wasn't it just the second team?"

But the opponent was Oman.

Even if it was the second team, we shouldn't have lost.

That's how much of a level gap there was between South Korea and Oman.

To lose 1-0 to such a team.

Shots, 23 to 3.

Shots on target, 10 to 1.

Possession, 65 to 35.

We led in all metrics but still lost.

Kang Juwon, who played as my partner, let out a long sigh and apologized to me.

"Sorry. I created so many good chances."

"These kinds of games happen."

I knew that Kang Juwon wasn't in his best form, having just returned from an injury and rejoining the national team.

So I didn't say anything.

I learned a lot from this game.

Soccer is a team sport played by 11 people.

And why strikers who score goals are so highly valued.

I could feel the reason.

[Shock defeat for South Korea! Despite leading in all metrics, they ultimately failed to score!]

[Dominant debut for Park Minho! But all good chances were squandered due to the poor form of South Korea's attack!]

[Kang Juwon wasted three killer passes from Park Minho! Is he not back to his best yet?]

[A gem found in a poor match! Park Minho! A shocking A-match debut!]

[Coach Ivankovic: "We were too swayed by South Korea's number 17. If not for goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi's saves, we would have definitely lost."]

[Comments]

- Is this... the national team? Hahahahaha

- Wow, Kang Juwon is really hopeless; how can he miss all those good passes?

- ???: Is this the national team?

- Park Minho could slap the attackers, and he'd be innocent.

- Shin Junseo: Minho, the national team is like that... You have to score! You! Don't trust your teammates!

- Isn't that a famous quote from a Dodgers pitcher?

- Close but not quite, lol

- Wow... Park Minho is really amazing. He gets pushed a bit by defenders, but he doesn't easily lose the ball.

- By holding the center like that, other attackers clearly come alive.

- Later, if they put Shin Junseo in the second line with Lee Junseok, Hwang Yoohyun, and Jung Yoohyuk, and Park Minho in the forward line, the performance would be better.

- Having a forward who can do post play and link up changes the whole team's movement.

After the match against Oman,

the team's mood was down.

But Coach Pedro and his coaching staff quickly lifted the spirits and prepared for the next match.

"Mino, how did it feel to play at the front?"

"It's definitely a different feeling from the second line."

Definitely.

The second line and the front are different.

Although the second central line, where I usually play, is increasingly pressured due to the recent trend in modern soccer,

it can't compare to being a forward who directly competes with defenders.

Still, this had its own fun.

Moreover, when I stood at the front,

I identified some weaknesses.

We lost, but

I learned a lot from the game.

It wasn't just a frustrating match.

"Alright! Let's train harder for the next five days!"

Following the coach's words, I focused on training again.

The 9th match of the World Cup final qualifiers against Uzbekistan was waiting.

* * *

I made my A-match debut with the friendly against Oman,

but I wasn't very nervous.

Maybe it was because I kept telling myself, "It's just a friendly."

In that sense, this match against Uzbekistan made my heart race for some reason.

Whether good or bad, it would affect me.

Uzbekistan still had a chance.

They were just 1 point behind 3rd place China.

Winning here would significantly increase their chances of advancing to the playoffs, keeping their dream of reaching the World Cup finals alive, albeit slimly.

So, unlike South Korea, who approached it experimentally, Uzbekistan brought out their best eleven.

Though similar in level to Oman, some of their players have the talent to play in the top 4 European leagues.

A team not to be taken lightly with the current squad.

Before the match started, I briefly texted my parents that I would be starting today.

Would they feel heartbroken seeing me now?

Beep!

"Hey! That was too rough."

A warning from the referee as the Uzbek defender who fouled me shrugged and backed off.

Well, at least I kept the ball.

Honestly, the taste of grass in my mouth is a bit unpleasant.

I grabbed the hand offered by my opponent and stood up, heading back to my position.

A free-kick from a somewhat long distance.

The kicker was the eldest member of the national team, Jung Woojoon.

The referee's whistle blew again.

Jung Woojoon's kick flew towards the goal.

Dang!

"Ugh!"

I heard Kang Juwon's curse after misjudging where the ball would drop, and saw the Uzbek defender clear the ball far away.

The early part of the first half was surprisingly even.

It meant the opponent was determined.

Knowing this, Coach Pedro was giving instructions louder than usual.

The ball was passed to me again.

But I couldn't connect it further.

Beep!

"Ouch!"

Another tackle.

They were particularly rough on me today.

Not maliciously rough,

but just enough.

Soccer is a physical sport, so I could understand.

But I couldn't just keep taking it.

Feigning a bit more pain, the referee decisively pulled out a yellow card for the next foul.

"No! I didn't foul that hard!"

Sorry, but

my acting was better this time.

The referee was firm.

The Uzbek defender was flustered.

Now, one of their center-backs couldn't easily mark me.

Still grumbling, the guy.

Damn it. If my calf hurts through the shin guard, you basically swung recklessly, didn't you?

That's just shameless.

"Was your performance in the Oman match that impressive? They keep fouling you."

"Seems like it."

Kang Juwon offered a hand.

Ugh... my waist hurts.

I barely got up and moved after a short rest.

Another free-kick.

Jung Woojoon stood by the ball again.

Slowly taking my position, I looked at Jung Woojoon.

As he raised his hand, the free-kick flew in.

It was lower than expected.

My body reacted instinctively.

I could definitely get this.

Putting in some effort, I stretched my foot.

As soon as the ball hit my foot, I lifted it high towards the goal, turning my back to it.

I sensed someone behind me.

An Uzbek defender, probably.

At that moment, an image formed in my mind.

My body moved exactly as I imagined.

As the ball dropped, I shifted my weight and jumped.

I lifted my left foot high over my head.

Wham!

The ball hit my foot and quickly shook the net.

The goalkeeper couldn't react in time.

He couldn't read the trajectory of the shot.

But I was sure of the goal.

"Ahhhhh! You crazy guy!"

"Park Minho! You maniac!"

"It's a goal! Gooooooal!"

In an instant, the other players swarmed over me.

* * *

- It's not good.

- There's a good chance here. South Korea. They can make the most of this opportunity.

- The ball goes to Park Minho. Ah! A yellow card for Uzbekistan's Vitaliy Denisov.

- It was definitely a rough foul.

- Park Minho is receiving a lot of attention today. He made his A-match debut in the friendly against Oman and showed an outstanding performance.

- He's a completely different type of forward from Kang Juwon. Especially his post play and link-up were excellent, right? Uzbekistan seems to be aware of that and is putting strong pressure on him.

"Is Minho going to get injured at this rate?"

"Jeez... They’re treating Minho, who should be the backbone of AC Milan, so roughly? These bastards."

"No, Minho will come to Inter."

In a house in Milan,

Park Minho's friends from his study abroad days were gathered to watch the South Korean national team match.

Although the internet was a bit slow and laggy,

it couldn't dampen their love for soccer.

Kim Jushik, using the chat ID 'LoveMilan', gulped down his beer roughly.

"But... what's with the national team's attackers? They couldn't capitalize in the Oman match, and they're missing chances again today."

Cha Hyerin, with the ID 'RealMilan', frowned and agreed with Kim Jushik's words.

"Kang Juwon is playing terribly today... He already missed two goals! Just score one, please!"

The two of them were downing their drinks while cursing the poor performance of South Korea's attack.

- Now, a free-kick situation.

- Jung Woojoon's free-kick!

- It looks a bit low... Ah! Park Minho has it! And the ball bounces high... Oh! He shoots!

- Goal!

- An incredible goal!

Wow!

In an instant, the two who were cursing South Korea's attack jumped up from their seats.

"What happened? What happened?"

'KingJuventus' Lee Seongkyung, who was bringing some snacks from the kitchen, rushed to the living room.

But the wonderful moment had already passed, and only the subtitles announcing Park Minho's goal remained.

"Wait. They'll show a replay soon."

As Cha Hyerin said,

soon, Park Minho's opening goal was replayed.

A fantastic bicycle kick.

Seeing Park Minho's display, the three of them were elated.

"Wow... Park Minho! He's on another level."

"Right."

"Honestly... could Minho be the god of soccer?"

"Maybe."

Their friend was instantly elevated to the status of a soccer god.

"Minho will definitely become an amazing player."

"I think so too."

"But I don't think his current team can handle him."

"Parma? It's a good team, but... it's too much."

"Sorry to Roberto, but you're right."

The three nodded in agreement.

"Still, Minho should go to AC Milan..."

"No, Inter is where Minho should go..."

"Juventus is..."

But,

their opinions did not match.

After a moment of silence,

they spoke again.

"““Soccer noobs.”””

* * *

Beep! Beeeep! Beeeep!

- The match is over!

- A 2-0 victory! South Korea, after losing to Oman in the friendly, bounces back with a 2-0 win against Uzbekistan, bringing a good atmosphere.

Unlike the Oman match, we scored well.

The performance was much better.

Kang Juwon, who had a terrible form in the Oman match, looked visibly brighter.

I thought the MVP today would be Kang Juwon,

but standing next to a brightly made-up reporter was me, who luckily scored a goal today.

Honestly, I don't remember what questions I was asked.

I just focused on giving short answers...

Worried it might be a problem, I contacted Leo, who said, "They were not bad answers."

Phew, that's a relief.

[A new striker candidate! Park Minho! A shocking debut and debut goal in the match against Uzbekistan!]

[Park Minho's fantastic bicycle kick debut goal against Uzbekistan!]

[Coach Pedro: "Park Minho is definitely a player in my plans. Today's performance gave me more confidence."]

[A fierce battle up front! From Kang Juwon, Park Sangbin, Lim Joosung, to Park Minho! Coach Pedro is delighted with various styles of forwards!]

[Comments]

- Truly a Korean Benzema... Wow, seeing him hold the ball under pressure and deliver killer passes was impressive.

- Kang Juwon and Park Sangbin are already good forwards, and Lim Joosung is better at post play than Park Minho, so it must be a tough decision.

- The Oman match was disappointing, but... such games do happen. I understand.

- More importantly, Parma must be thrilled, lol. They got such a player for free and made him a starter, haha.

- ???: From now on... should I start praising him?

- Sir, that's a risky joke.

The reactions from soccer fans and the media were positive.

But I wasn't satisfied.

Even though post play and link-up are my strengths as a forward...

Honestly, I prefer scoring goals.

So,

next time the national team calls me, I want to be an even better player and help the team.

Yes, linking up is good, but

I want to be a player who scores goals better than anyone.

That's the kind of player I want to be for the national team.
