## 6. National Team? Me? Why? (3)

- Ah! The game ends!

- The friendly match against Oman concludes with South Korea losing 1-0.

- Ah... The performance was really good, but the lack of finishing ability ultimately held us back.

- This needs to be fixed. Other than Shin Junseo, there is no definite scorer, which is really dangerous, isn't it?

- Still, Park Minho really stood out, didn't he?

- That's right. Park Minho, who played for the first 45 minutes, was really good. A lot of opportunities were created while he was on the field.

It was the worst game.

After conceding a goal from a single counterattack, South Korea kept missing good opportunities.

Someone might say, "Isn't it just the second team?"

But the opponent was Oman.

No matter how much it was the second team, losing wasn’t an option.

South Korea and Oman were teams with such a significant difference in level.

And yet, they lost 1-0 to such a team.

Shots: 23 to 3.

Shots on target: 10 to 1.

Possession: 65% to 35%.

Despite leading in all indicators, they lost.

Senior Kang Juwon, who played as my partner, sighed deeply and apologized to me.

“Sorry. I created a lot of good chances.”

“These things happen in games.”

I knew that senior Kang Juwon had just returned from an injury and wasn’t in his best form.

So, I didn’t say anything.

I learned a lot from this game.

Soccer is a team sport played by eleven people.

And I realized why strikers who score goals are so highly valued.

I could feel the reason.

[Shock defeat for South Korea! Despite leading in all indicators, they failed to score!]

[Dominant debut for Park Minho! But all good opportunities were wasted due to the poor performance of South Korea’s attackers!]

[Kang Juwon squandered three killer passes from Park Minho! Is his form not back yet?]

[A diamond found in a bad game! Park Minho! Shocking A-match debut!]

[Coach Ivanković, ‘We were too dominated by South Korea’s number 17. If it weren’t for the saves by goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi, we would have definitely lost.’]

[Comments]

- Is this... the national team? Hahahahahaha

- Wow, Kang Juwon is really hopeless; how can he miss all those good passes?

- ???: Is this the national team?

- Park Minho could slap the attackers and it would be justified.

- Shin Junseo: Minho... The national team is like this... You have to score! You! Don’t trust your teammates!

- Isn’t that a quote from a Dodgers pitcher?

- Similar, but no, lol

- Wow... Park Minho is really amazing. He gets pushed a bit by defenders, but he doesn’t easily lose the ball.

- When he holds the center like that, other attackers definitely come alive.

- If later on, we put Shin Junseo in the second line with Lee Junseok, Hwang Yoohyun, and Jung Yoohyuk, and Minho at the forefront, the performance might be even better.

- Having an attacker who can both post-play and link-up changes the entire team’s movement.

After the match against Oman, the atmosphere among the players sank.

But Coach Pedro and the coaching staff quickly lifted the team’s spirits and prepared for the next game.

“Minho, how did it feel to play at the forefront?”

“It’s definitely different from playing in the second line.”

Indeed, the second line and the forefront were different.

Although the central second line, where he usually played, was increasingly under pressure due to modern soccer trends, it couldn’t be compared to directly competing with defenders at the forefront.

Still, it had its own fun.

Moreover, standing at the forefront allowed me to identify certain shortcomings.

Even though we lost, I learned a lot from this game.

It wasn’t just a frustrating game.

“Alright! Let’s push hard for the next five days!”

Following the coach’s words, we focused on training again.

The ninth match of the World Cup final qualifiers against Uzbekistan awaited us.

* * *

Although I made my A-match debut with the friendly against Oman, I wasn't very nervous.

Perhaps it was because I had mentally prepared myself by thinking, ‘This is just a friendly match.’

In that sense, the upcoming match against Uzbekistan strangely made my heart race.

Whether that was good or bad, it would influence me.

Uzbekistan still had a chance.

They were just 1 point behind third-place China.

Winning here would significantly increase their chances of making it to the playoffs, and from there, albeit slim, they could continue dreaming of the World Cup finals.

Thus, unlike South Korea, which was experimenting, Uzbekistan brought out their best eleven.

They were a team of a similar level to Oman, but some of their players had the talent to play in Europe’s top four leagues.

With the current squad, they were not a team to be taken lightly.

Before the match started, I texted my parents briefly to say that I would be starting today.

Would they feel heartache seeing me now?

Whistle!

“Hey! That was too rough.”

The Uzbek defender who fouled me shrugged and stepped back at the referee’s warning.

Well, at least I kept the ball.

Honestly, the taste of grass in my mouth wasn’t pleasant.

I grabbed the hand extended by the opponent and got up, heading back to my position.

A free kick from a somewhat far distance.

The kicker was senior Jung Woojun, the oldest member of the national team.

As the referee’s whistle blew again, senior Jung Woojun’s kick flew towards the goal.

Buzz!

“Ah!”

After hearing senior Kang Juwon’s curse for misjudging where the ball would fall, I saw the Uzbek defender clearing the ball far away.

The early stages of the first half were pretty even.

It meant the opponent was really determined.

Knowing this, Coach Pedro was giving instructions louder than usual.

A pass was delivered to me again.

But I couldn’t connect further.

Whistle!

“Ah!”

Another tackle.

For some reason, they were particularly rough on me today.

Not that they were maliciously rough.

They were just playing tough.

Soccer is a tough sport, so I could fully understand it.

Still, I couldn’t just keep taking it.

Pretending to be in a bit of pain, the referee firmly drew a yellow card at the next foul.

“No! I didn’t tackle that hard!”

Sorry, but my acting was better this time.

The referee was firm.

The Uzbek defender was flustered.

With this, one of the central defenders would no longer easily hold me down.

The guy still whining.

Damn, if my calf hurts through the shin guards, he pretty much just swung wildly, didn’t he?

That’s just shameless.

“Your performance in the Oman match must have been really impressive! They’re all targeting you.”

“Seems like it.”

Senior Kang Juwon extended a hand.

Ugh... my back aches.

Barely getting up, I moved a bit after resting for a moment.

Another free kick.

Senior Jung Woojun stood over the ball again.

Slowly positioning myself, I looked at senior Jung Woojun.

Soon, he raised his hand and the free kick flew in.

It was lower than I expected.

My body reacted instinctively.

I could definitely get this.

Putting in a bit of effort, I stretched my foot out.

And as soon as the ball touched my foot, I lifted it high towards the goal with my back to it.

I felt a presence behind me.

Must be a Uzbek defender.

At that moment, an image formed in my mind.

My body moved exactly as I thought.

Timing my jump with the falling ball, I lifted my left foot high over my head.

Bam!

The ball hit my foot and shook the net swiftly.

It was too quick for the goalkeeper to react.

He couldn’t track the trajectory of the shot.

But I was sure it was a goal.

“Ahhhh! You crazy guy!”

“Park Minho! You madman!”

“It’s a goal! Gooooooal!”

In an instant, my teammates swarmed over me.

* * *

- It’s not good.

- There’s a good chance here. South Korea. They can make the most of it.

- The ball reaches Park Minho. Ah! Vitaliy Denisov of Uzbekistan gets a yellow card.

- It was definitely a rough foul.

- Park Minho is receiving a lot of attention today. This is only his A-match debut following the friendly against Oman, but he showed a brilliant performance.

- Unlike Kang Juwon, he’s a different type of striker. His post-play and link-up were really good, right? Knowing this, Uzbekistan is applying strong pressure.

“Won’t Minho get injured at this rate?”

“Damn... Do they really have to treat Minho, who’s supposed to be the cornerstone of AC Milan, so roughly? These bastards.”

“No, Minho will come to Inter.”

In a home in Milan, Park Minho’s friends studying abroad were gathered to watch the South Korean national team game.

Even though the internet was slightly slow and lagging, it couldn’t hinder their love for soccer.

Kim Joosik, using the group chat ID ‘LoveMilan,’ gulped down his beer roughly.

“But... what’s up with the national team’s attackers today? Just like the Oman game, they’re not finishing anything.”

Cha Hyerin, using the ID ‘RealMilan,’ frowned and agreed with Kim Joosik’s sentiment.

“Today, Kang Juwon is really bad... He already missed two goals! Please, just score one!”

The two were cursing the poor performance of South Korea’s attackers while drinking.

- Now a free-kick situation.

- Jung Woojun’s free-kick!

- It seems a bit low... Ah! Park Minho has it! And the ball is high... Oh! Just like that!

- Just like that, a shot! Gooooooal!

- An incredible goal!

Waaah!

Suddenly, the two who were cursing South Korea’s attackers jumped up from their seats.

“What’s going on? What’s happening?”

Lee Seongkyung, using the ID ‘KingWangJangJuve,’ who was bringing some snacks from the kitchen, hurried into the living room.

But the magnificent scene had already passed, leaving only the caption that Park Minho had scored.

“Wait. They’ll show the replay soon.”

Just as Cha Hyerin said, Park Minho’s opening goal was replayed shortly after.

A sensational bicycle kick.

Watching Park Minho’s performance, the three friends expressed their joy.

“Wow... Truly Park Minho! He’s on another level.”

“Right.”

“Honestly... could Minho be the god of soccer?”

“Maybe.”

Their friend was instantly elevated to the god of soccer.

“Minho will definitely become an incredible player.”

“I think so too.”

“But I don’t think his current team can handle him.”

“Parma? A good team, but... it’s definitely too much.”

“Sorry to Roberto, but you’re right.”

The three nodded in agreement.

“Definitely, Minho to AC Milan...”

“No, Inter is Minho’s...”

“Juventus is...”

However, their opinions did not match.

A brief silence followed.

The three then spoke again.

“““You soccer noobs.”””

* * *

Whistle! Whistle! Whistle!

- The game ends!

- A 2-0 victory! South Korea lost to Oman in the previous friendly but secured a refreshing 2-0 victory over Uzbekistan today, bringing a positive atmosphere.

Unlike the Oman match, goals came easily, and the performance was much better.

Senior Kang Juwon, who had a terrible form in the Oman match, also had a much brighter expression today.

I thought senior Kang Juwon would be the MVP today, but...

Standing next to the reporter with bright makeup was me, who scored a lucky goal.

Honestly, I don’t remember what questions I was asked.

I just answered briefly and earnestly...

Concerned about any issues, I contacted Leo, who replied, ‘Your answers were fine.’

Phew, what a relief.

[A new forward candidate! Park Minho! Shocking debut match and debut goal!]

[Park Minho’s fantastic bicycle kick debut goal against Uzbekistan!]

[Coach Pedro, ‘Park Minho is definitely a player in my plans. Today’s performance confirmed it further.’]

[The fierce competition for the forward position! Kang Juwon, Park Sangbin, Lim Juseong, and Park Minho! Coach Pedro faces a happy dilemma with various styles of forwards!]

[Comments]

- Truly the Korean Benzema... Wow, seeing him hold the ball in a physical battle and then make killer passes, I was really impressed.

- Kang Juwon and Park Sangbin are good forwards, and Lim Juseong is better at post-play than Park Minho, so it must be a tough decision.

- The Oman match was disappointing... But such games aren’t always absent, so I understand.

- More than that, Parma is so lucky, lol. They got such a player for free and are using him as a starter, lol.

- ???: From now on... should we start hyping him?

- Sir, that’s a risky joke.

The fans' and media's reactions were favorable.

But I wasn’t satisfied.

No matter how much my post-play and link-up play were my strengths at the forefront...

Honestly, I preferred scoring goals.

So, when I get called up to the national team again, I want to be a much better player and help the team more than I did today.

Sure, link-up play is good, but...

I want to be a player who scores goals better than anyone.

In the national team, I want to be that kind of player.
