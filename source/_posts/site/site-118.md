## 45. King Henry, King Salah, God Mino (1)

After winning against Newcastle, I could feel that I had reached a significant milestone.

[Park Minho! Ties King Henry’s ‘Most Goals in a Season for Arsenal’!]

[Park Minho already reaches 39 goals this season! Can he surpass King Henry?]

[Mino! Strong contender for ‘Player of the Month’ in January!]

[Park Minho needs just ‘2 more goals’ to break the EPL single-season goal record!]

[Since the restructuring to 38 rounds, the EPL single-season goal record is King Salah’s 32 goals!]

[Mino! Just 4 more goals to tie Andy Cole and Alan Shearer’s 34-goal record from when the EPL had 42 rounds!]

First, there was King Henry’s record for most goals in a single season for Arsenal, which I felt could be tied anytime with just one more goal.

This record could be broken with just one goal in either the League Cup or the FA Cup.

I was confident I could surpass the second record for league goals as well.

There were plenty of matches left, and I only needed two more goals to match Salah’s record.

I thought that this record could be broken anytime too.

As long as I didn’t suffer any major injuries.

I also felt confident about the third and final record.

This was the league’s highest goal record set during the 42-round era, and I only needed 4 more goals to tie with Andy Cole and Alan Shearer’s record.

If I scored 5 goals in the league... well, my name would go down in EPL history.

By myself.

Thanks to this, Arsenal was currently buzzing with talks about my records.

Of course, it was only natural that everyone would be excited since I was on the verge of surpassing not only Henry’s legendary record but also league records in my debut season in the EPL.

What? Am I being a bit arrogant?

I don’t care.

A striker lives for his own greatness.

“Mino... you’ve lost your humble beginnings.”

“No, I haven’t.”

Even if a striker lives for his own greatness, he doesn’t slack off in training like that lazy guy over there.

Noticing my gaze, Aman Richards looked at me, scratched his head, and laughed innocently.

Despite his mischievous behavior, when he smiles like that, he looks like a genuine, simple country boy.

Anyway.

We were currently maintaining a really good momentum.

We had an incredible win rate of 22 wins and 1 draw by the 23rd round of the league.

Considering that it was only the end of January, there were still many matches left to win for an undefeated championship, but at least we were the team closest to winning the league.

Experts attributed our success to various factors, but I thought it was similar to what I had shown during my time at Parma.

An excellent defense, midfielders who perfectly executed the coach’s plans, and attackers who scored one more goal than the opponent in any situation.

The current Arsenal squad was capable of achieving incredible feats.

Honestly, our coach may not be a tactical genius, but he has a great eye for players.

The players we signed this summer had already established themselves as key members of Arsenal, and Jules Kaembe, who joined this winter, was gradually getting more playtime.

However, it’s uncertain if we can win all the remaining matches.

As I felt during my time at Parma, as we get closer to a significant record, opponents will try to disrupt us in any way possible.

The EPL was no different.

As we moved into the latter half of the season, the increasingly rough physical play from opponents caused some of our players to suffer minor injuries.

Thanks to our coach’s frequent rotation policy, the team was still managing, but if it weren’t for that, our squad would have been thinned by injuries and we would have experienced defeats by now.

“Mino! Never get injured.”

Our coach, looking at me with a wistful gaze, now had a bald spot reaching his crown.

At Parma, it was still just his forehead, but now he could truly be called a bald eagle.

In the game against Newcastle, Bruno Campos and Gabriel Artinelli, who came on as substitutes, were injured and couldn’t play in the upcoming match against Leeds.

This created a perfect condition for our coach’s hair to recede further.

As I said before.

I will never become a coach.

My hair is precious.

But since our coach’s hair is also precious, I’ll make sure to win the next match against Leeds to protect what’s left of his hair.

* * *

Leeds was struggling in the relegation zone this season.

They had been in crisis even when they were led by the coach known as the Madman, but the new coach who took over managed to finish the season in 17th place, allowing Leeds to stay in the league.

One of the teams relegated that season was Everton.

They earned promotion again the next season by finishing 2nd and returned to the EPL.

Leeds was currently in 18th place this season.

They were 2 points short of Newcastle, who had fallen to 17th place, so it was crucial for them to earn at least one point from this match.

The match was being held at Leeds’ home ground.

Even though their opponent was league-leading Arsenal, playing at home gave them a chance to snatch at least one point.

Unlike Newcastle, who spent a lot of money but were still struggling near the relegation zone, Leeds was not a team that could afford to spend big money in the first place.

Perhaps their current position was a natural outcome.

But no team wants to be relegated, so Leeds was slowly preparing for the Arsenal match.

They aimed to hold out as much as possible and get a draw.

One point was incredibly valuable to Leeds.

However, as the game started, even holding onto one point seemed incredibly difficult.

-Leeds! They’re shaky from the beginning of the match!

-Despite dropping their lines, Arsenal continues to exploit Leeds’ gaps.

From the beginning of the match, Leeds frequently lost possession to Arsenal’s pressure and struggled to maintain their strength.

Especially with Park Minho coming down to the third line to receive the ball with unusual vigor, Leeds’ midfield pressure was ineffective.

Moreover, Aman Richards, who was excited to start, kept recklessly breaking through the flanks, making it difficult for Leeds to launch counterattacks.

The field was already dominated by Arsenal.

The overwhelming difference in performance was causing Leeds’ home fans at Elland Road to clutch their heads in despair.

The performance gap was that significant.

Leeds’ players felt like they were facing European giants like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, and PSG while playing against Arsenal.

At the same time, they had these thoughts.

“If Arsenal, who aren’t even in the Champions League, are this good, how good are the teams playing in the Champions League?”

“What on earth is happening in the EPL? Arsenal is on an unbeaten run?”

“This is hell. Yeah, this is a hell given by the football gods for not donating yesterday.”

Despite being relentlessly beaten, Leeds clung to the hope of a 0-0 score.

No matter how dominant Arsenal’s performance was, if goals weren’t scored, they couldn’t win.

However.

Their hope ended in the 16th minute of the first half.

Tweet!

-He’s pointed! The referee has pointed!

-Oh no! A critical mistake by Jeremie Struijk! The tackle was too dangerous!

-Mino wins a penalty, putting Leeds in a dangerous situation!

It was a chance created by Park Minho’s threatening breakthrough.

As Park Minho slowly got up after pretending to be hurt on the field, Elland Road’s home fans greeted him with boos and curses.

“Booooooo!”

“You bastard! Do you think this is your home? Get up already! Before I make you regret it!”

“Fuuuuuuuuucking! What a shitty game!”

Taking a deep breath, Park Minho faced Leeds’ goalkeeper Guillaume Meslier at the goalpost, while the players made way for Kasper Nielsen to take the penalty.

Since it was his grandmother’s birthday in the hospital today, Kasper Nielsen was determined to score this penalty.

Moreover, he couldn’t afford to fail after receiving the chance from Park Minho, who was on the verge of a record.

Failing would certainly earn him some backlash from the Gunners for a few days.

Of course, Kasper Nielsen didn’t make a mistake.

He calmly converted the penalty, sending his voice to his grandmother in the hospital.

-Kasper Niiiiiielsen! Scores his 5th goal of the season with a successful penalty!

-Oh! Things are getting worse for Leeds!

Already heavily outplayed, Leeds conceded an early goal, making their situation even more dire.

Now Leeds had no choice but to push their lines forward.

But Arsenal’s skill was too superior for that.

As soon as they tried to push their lines, Aman Richards started causing more havoc.

While Jules Kaembe tormented the flanks with speed, Aman Richards used his excellent dribbling skills and newfound strength from recent muscle gains to bulldoze through.

Unfortunately for Leeds, they didn’t have a fullback capable of stopping Aman Richards.

Leeds’ left-back, Jayce Shackleton, tried to block Aman Richards by throwing his body in, but Aman easily pushed him aside and broke through the flank.

Of course, his finishing was still a mess.

-Oh! Another cross that’s a bit too long.

-But he’s improved a lot!

-That’s right. Last season, Aman Richards was just a dribbler with no end product, but now he has various options, making him a more formidable player.

Leeds had no choice but to hunker down.

Until the end of the first half, Leeds was just desperately defending against Arsenal’s relentless attacks.

The first half ended that way.

The expressions of Leeds players entering the locker room looked as exhausted as if they had played a full 90 minutes.

* * *

I feel good.

Even with the rotation, Arsenal was consistently performing well.

Thanks to this, I could fully focus on ‘shooting’, and I created half of the effective shots in the first half, eventually earning a penalty.

But I wasn’t satisfied.

After all, there was no ‘goal’.

I couldn’t be satisfied.

The coach instructed us to keep pressing Leeds in the second half as we did in the first half.

Even though the score difference wasn’t huge, it was a game where it felt like we would never lose.

The coach probably felt the same way I did.

Anyway.

After the short halftime break, the second half began.

Leeds showed their determination to catch up by actively making player substitutions.

But their will was broken just 9 minutes into the second half.

If you ask who broke it... well, I could say it was me.

It was a single counterattack.

Leeds had ventured forward for a rare attack.

We intercepted the ball and launched a counterattack.

I wasn’t the type to miss an opportunity when Leeds’ defense was in disarray from pushing forward.

Using individual skills to shake off one defender, I sped up and passed another.

While I was dodging two defenders, Leeds’ defense barely regained their positions, but this also meant I had attackers to utilize.

-Mino! Passes quickly to Saka!

-Returns it! Mino swiftly penetrates the center!

-Dribbles past another defender!

“Stop him!”

A Leeds defender shouted in desperation.

But despite their calls, they couldn’t stop me as I had already entered the danger zone.

Thud!

Thwack!

With a thud, the ball went flying.

With a thwack, it went in.

-Gooooooooooooal!

-Amazing shot by Mino! A powerful shot that goes over the goalkeeper!

-Minooooo! With this, he surpasses King Henry’s record with his 40th goal of the season!

-Additionally, he is now just one goal away from Salah’s league record of 32 goals!

-Incredible! Mino! He is truly a god!

As soon as I confirmed the goal, I ran to the broadcast camera and did Henry’s celebration.

I wondered what kind of expression Monica would have while watching today’s match.

I hoped she wasn’t crying again.
