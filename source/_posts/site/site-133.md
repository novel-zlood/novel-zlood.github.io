## 48. Another Victory! (4)

The thirty-three-year-old veteran forward could feel more than anyone that his prime was slowly fading.

But he wasn’t the kind of person to just sit around waiting for his time to end.

Fabio worked harder than anyone.

The problem was that despite his efforts, time kept moving forward, and it was regrettable that he was now entering a period where his shortcomings were increasing more than his strengths.

“Hoo…”

All kinds of thoughts floated in and out of his mind.

He was a player who showed very different performances in other leagues compared to Serie A.

Some people would say,

Fabio Immobile is a forward optimized for his domestic league, and that's why there are always shortcomings when compared to world-class forwards.

His playing style was the same.

His main strengths were his decent physicality and speed for line-breaking, but he couldn’t overcome the common weaknesses that most penetrating forwards possess.

Some experts called him the ‘Canary of Serie A,’ likening him to a canary that could never leave its cage.

Naturally, Fabio Immobile didn’t like that expression at all.

Much like how he still disliked Juventus.

“Damn it!”

Was it because of all these distracting thoughts?

Even during training, he couldn’t fully concentrate.

His teammates subtly avoided him.

To be honest, this season was a failure.

A disastrous season ending with just 6 goals in the league.

Although he managed to somewhat recover his poor form by scoring 19 goals in the Europa League, the fact that Lazio couldn’t climb higher than 6th in the league was undoubtedly affected by his poor league performance.

This only made Fabio more sorrowful about his declining skills.

At the same time, it sparked a small determination within him.

It meant he had the ambition to continue playing football well into his late thirties, like Ronaldo or Messi.

It was certainly a possible story.

The performance Ronaldo showed this season was remarkable for a thirty-eight-year-old.

Messi was no different.

Though his peak scoring ability had faded, his performance in the second line brought great vitality to PSG.

Fabio thought,

He could also play for a long time like that.

His prime wasn’t over yet.

Yes, he definitely thought so.

[Mino: “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t compare me to a player who scored only 6 goals in the league. I scored 46 goals.”]

[Mino: “Fabio? I faced him when playing in Serie A… He was just a good player.”]

Crack.

Fabio Immobile clenched his fist tightly.

He felt even more outraged at the thought that they considered him an old has-been.

At the same time, he resolved to show his true abilities in the Europa League final.

* * *

It had been a while since I made some provocative remarks.

Monica must have found these provocations amusing, as she asked me, “Did you ever have a fight with Fabio during your time in Serie A?” when I returned home.

I rarely gave provocative interviews after joining Arsenal.

I merely responded to provocations that were initiated by the other side.

And it was true that my remarks and Fabio’s words had increased interest in the Europa League final.

Unlike the previous final, various football communities were abuzz with discussions about the Europa League final.

One of the most straightforward and frequently discussed topics was, “Who is the best forward?”

Consequently, various reasons were given for why certain forwards from each league were considered the best.

While browsing through the community, I saw a post titled, “Minho needs to prove himself in the Champions League.”

Monica, upon seeing the post, began fiddling with her smartphone, and soon the post was bombarded with “dislikes” and disappeared.

I glanced sideways to see Monica smiling brightly and waving cutely.

“….”

She’s really beautiful.

I’ve never seen anyone as beautiful and cute as Monica.

But she might be a bit scary… I’m not sure.

Anyway.

After spending two days in London,

I headed to Yerevan, where the Razdan Stadium is located, with Monica seeing me off.

On the plane, the players’ expressions were varied.

Having experienced finals several times, there were no players who were particularly nervous.

After a relatively short flight, the team arrived in Yerevan, Armenia, and headed to a nearby hotel.

Yerevan already had a somewhat festive atmosphere in anticipation of the Europa League final.

[Mino! Can he break Messi’s record?]

[An incredible number of attacking points! Mino continues to make history!]

[Mino scores 72 goals in a season! Just one more goal to tie with Messi’s 73 goals in a single season! More goals will set a new record!]

The media continued to mention my name.

Indeed, scoring lots of goals inevitably attracts attention.

Monica often says, “Mino, you just need to do this well! Don’t try to do better than now!”

When I asked why, she said it’s because if I do better, I might transfer to mega clubs like Real Madrid or PSG.

Honestly, even though I have no intention of leaving, Monica seemed to worry about such scenarios often.

It meant I was doing well.

That’s why I thought I was receiving such attention.

Hmm… I’m doing well, even in my own opinion.

There aren’t many forwards who score 72 goals in a season.

Even Messi, after scoring 73 goals in one season, mostly scored between 40 and 50 goals.

Honestly, scoring just 30 goals in a season is enough for people to praise you as a top-class forward.

You can see this by looking at Lorenzo, who is filming some weird SNS video next to me.

This season, Lorenzo scored 40 goals.

He scored 26 goals in the league and spread his goals across the League Cup, FA Cup, and Europa League.

And the expectations placed on Lorenzo can be seen from his nickname, “The Hope of Italy.”

That cheeky, greedy guy is the hope of Italy.

I wonder what kind of team the Italian national team is to call such a fool their hope?

Sigh… Scoring more than 30 goals in a season is really tough.

“More than that, it’s amazing.”

I looked at Fabio Immobile’s record.

It was surprising that a player who only scored 6 goals in the league managed to score 30 goals in a season.

Even though he showed poor form in the league, considering his abilities, he couldn’t be underestimated.

Fortunately, Arsenal’s defense was well aware of that.

And on the day of the game,

The stands of Razdan Stadium quickly filled with football fans.

“Come on Arsenal! Come on Arsenal!”

The enthusiastic chants of the Gunners could be heard.

The locker room also began to heat up in response.

The coach looked at us and didn’t say a word.

“….”

After making eye contact with each player,

He simply said one thing at the right time.

“Go and smash them.”

Indeed, he’s intense.

That’s why I like our coach.

Completely different from the principal when I was in elementary school.

* * *

Before entering the field, the fierce gazes of the Lazio players pierced me in the tunnel.

When I smiled broadly at the Serie A players I hadn’t seen in a while, the expressions of some players, recalling last season, began to sour.

And I made eye contact with Fabio Immobile, with whom I had a war of words.

“….”

He seemed to have really sharpened his knives.

Lorenzo tapped my shoulder.

“Mino, if it looks like you’re going to get hit, just lie down immediately. I’ll fight for you.”

“Are you crazy?”

“How could I make it to the final without going crazy?”

It’s confusing when reality and absurdity mix.

Lorenzo’s way of speaking often puts me in a difficult position.

But since Lorenzo competes with the opposing defenders, I can play comfortably.

“Thanks, Lorenzo.”

“Why all of a sudden?”

“Take care of me today as well.”

Lorenzo grinned at my words.

This simple friend takes anything I say as a compliment, no matter what tone I use.

Before the game started,

The players gathered in a circle.

With the captain, Tierney, absent, I faced the players and spoke.

“Let’s go show those foolish Italian guys the taste of England’s fish and chips.”

“….”

Lorenzo glared at me fiercely.

Well, if you don’t like it, become Korean.

Beep!

Anyway.

The Europa League final finally began.

Both teams, with confident expressions, started exploring each other and engaged in a fierce midfield battle as soon as the match began.

Lazio took the offensive.

As I moved to the side, Pico Lazzari, whom I faced in Serie A last season, frowned.

“Aren’t you a central forward?”

“I’m a winger at Arsenal.”

“Damn!”

Come on… Are you so unhappy about me playing on the wing?

“Hmph. I’m hurt.”

“Ugh! That’s annoying. Let’s just shut up and focus on the game… I ask you this way.”

He really got upset.

That’s too much.

“Mino!”

So,

To comfort my hurt feelings, I should create a great play.

-Pass connected to Mino! As expected, Arsenal’s attack revolves around Mino!

-No coach would ignore a forward who scored 72 goals in a season. Lazio knows this well.

-I’m really curious about how Lazio will stop Mino… What kind of preparation they’ve made.

As soon as I touched the ball, Pico Lazzari kept a reasonable distance and focused on my feet.

There was no aggressive pressing.

He seemed to think it was better to keep a distance and mark me rather than risk a big breakthrough by pressing.

Certainly, keeping a distance made it a bit tricky to break through.

But it wasn’t impossible.

If I couldn’t break through this level of marking, I wouldn’t have scored 72 goals in a season.

Tap! Tap-tap!

Just three touches.

That was enough to make Pico Lazzari’s upper body lean in the opposite direction of my breakthrough.

-Mino! He passes Pico Lazzari!

-His dribble is really simple! But it’s powerful!

-Pico Lazzari stumbles for a moment and allows Mino to break through!

“Damn it!”

I heard a rough voice behind me.

Sorry… But it’s already too late, my friend.

Seeing my teammates rushing forward, I noticed that Lorenzo was surrounded by defenders.

Bruno was still far from catching up.

‘Should I use Amani for the first time in a while?’

As soon as I saw Amani Richards closing in from the opposite side, I lightly connected the ball to the other side.

Seeing the ball roll past Lorenzo and head straight towards Amani Richards, Lazio’s goalkeeper James Strakosha screamed.

“Block it!”

But his shout was too late.

Amani had already taken a powerful shot.

James Strakosha’s fingertips barely brushed the ball as it hit the back of the net.

Thud!

-Goooal! A goal in just 4 minutes of the first half! The scorer is Amani Richards!

-That’s it! A fantastic breakthrough by Mino, followed by a perfect pass to the opposite side! And a clean finish.

-Arsenal is showing beautiful football!

Amani, who scored, ran towards me.

And he shouted at me while looking at me.

“Minoooo! I’m better than Fabio Immobile, right? Right? Right?”

To this 19-year-old’s childish words, I could only smile and nod.

This time, he really did well.
