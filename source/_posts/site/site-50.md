## 18. Coppa Italia and an Unbeaten Season (4)

Thump thump.

Ahead of the match against AC Milan, the atmosphere within Parma was already tense, like soldiers preparing for war.

Of course, in a good way.

It's only natural to be enthusiastic.

In the world of professionals, the number of players who get to lift a championship trophy is extremely small, and even players on top league teams often retire without a single trophy.

So, it's not just the young players.

Even the veterans without a single championship in their career.

It's natural for everyone to be highly motivated.

At the same time, the legend Giovanni Buffon calmly prepared the team for the final, easing the tension among the players.

AC Milan, with two league matches left, cannot focus on the Coppa Italia final as much as we can.

Depending on the remaining two league matches, the league champion and runner-up could be decided.

There's only a one-point difference between league leaders Inter and AC Milan.

This means AC Milan can't fully concentrate on the Italian Cup final.

Not that they would give up, though.

"Are you that nervous?"

At my question, Santiago looked at me with eyes as if I was crazy.

"Minho, aren't you nervous?"

"Rather than nervous, I'm excited."

It's a chance to prove my worth against AC Milan's solid defense.

Moreover, it's the final.

I'm not saying I'm not nervous at all.

But I wasn't trembling like a scaredy-cat.

Santiago was so nervous that he kept circling the training ground.

Honestly, I wasn't worried about Santiago because I knew he would perform well when the match started.

Instead, my concern was for the young 18-year-old striker.

I couldn't help but worry about Kenneth.

No matter how tough and fearless that giant is.

I didn't know if he could withstand the pressure and burden of the final.

Bzzzzzz!

"Kenneth! It's just training! Take it easy!"

Michele Sepe looked at the still-shaking goalpost with a bewildered expression after Kenneth's cannon shot.

If he had blocked that with his head, it would have definitely resulted in a concussion.

I think so too, but how does Michele Sepe, who has been blocking Kenneth's monstrous shots throughout today's training, feel?

Honestly, Michele would be more nervous about Kenneth's monstrous shots in training than the tension of the final.

"Rather than that, the weather has been gloomy lately."

"Yes, it feels like it could rain anytime."

"Surely, it won't rain on the day of the final, right?"

At Giovanni's worry, I smiled and replied.

"Hey, no way it will rain, right? The match is the day after tomorrow, and the rain will stop tomorrow evening, so don't worry."

Despite my words, Giovanni frowned at the sky, feeling uneasy.

* * *

Shhhh!

May 11th.

Arriving at Stadio Olimpico for the Coppa Italia final, we let out a long sigh as we watched the rain that hadn't stopped yet.

"It's really raining."

"Is Giovanni a god?"

"Is this the foresight of a World Cup winner?"

The young players looked at Giovanni with sparkling eyes, amazed that he had predicted the weather on the day of the final.

Well, Giovanni was sighing deeply, thinking about the slippery field soaked in rain.

A field with many variables.

Moreover, when we stepped onto the field to warm up, the grass was quite short, making the ball roll quickly.

If you were a fast player, you could kick the ball long and use your speed properly.

Of course, it was slippery, making it difficult to show off flashy individual skills as much as you wanted.

"At least it's not waterlogged."

The grass was well-maintained, so it was slippery, but the ground underneath wasn't filled with water, which was a relief.

However, it seemed likely that either many goals would be scored or none at all in the second half.

This meant that the match could be decided in the first half.

Early morning football matches in Korea often take place in similar conditions in the summer.

There, the grass would be waterlogged, making it extremely difficult to chase the ball.

Just as we were concerned.

AC Milan's players were warming up on the field with quite serious expressions.

Some players were even touching the field with their hands, looking dissatisfied.

Returning to the locker room, we changed into our uniforms and focused on the match before heading out.

The cheers of the fans who had come to watch the match echoed into the locker room.

"Just remember this."

Our coach's speech began.

"This is the final."

"I know you're mentally struggling with nervousness."

"Even my arms are trembling with nerves."

"But AC Milan feels the same."

Coach Alain looked around at us.

We naturally made eye contact with the coach.

I felt a sense of strength in my body.

"In fact, AC Milan will have a harder time. They have to play their remaining two league matches fiercely."

"There's a one-point difference with league leaders Inter. How can AC Milan fully concentrate on today's final?"

Even if AC Milan doesn't want to.

They won't be able to fully focus on this final.

Yes, the coach's words were right.

They are in a situation where they can aim for the league title.

"Also, look outside."

"Isn't this shitty weather?"

Everyone laughed loudly at the coach's words.

Yes. It really is shitty weather.

"For today's match...! I believe the first half is crucial. The most important thing is to be more aggressive in defense and choke AC Milan."

"Attack fiercely even when you don't have the ball."

"The opponent will come out in a 4-2-3-1 formation. They'll press us with strong pressure and high activity."

"In the second half, both teams will be exhausted, making it difficult to score."

"So, I'm planning to decide the match within the first 20 minutes of the first half."

As soon as he finished speaking, Giovanni set the mood.

Everyone stood up with the same thought in mind.

It's time to head to the field.

Our opponent is currently second in Serie A, AC Milan.

And we are the undefeated champions of Serie B.

"Let's go show them."

"Who we are."

Following Giovanni out of the locker room, I was the second to open the door and step into the corridor.

* * *

- We are broadcasting the Coppa Italia final from Stadio Olimpico, where the rain is still falling lightly.

- The match between AC Milan and Parma! The team that will lift the Coppa Italia trophy will be decided in today's match!

Waaahhhhh!

A tremendous cheer erupted.

The players of both teams entered the field.

And soon, the match began.

- AC Milan has started Samuele Pellegrini in the front, excluding Zlatan and Giroud.

- Except for the frontline, AC Milan seems to have fielded almost all their key players for today's match.

Except for the injured frontline resources, AC Milan had fielded virtually their full-strength squad.

Just as Parma anticipated.

From the start of the match, the ball bounced around, going back and forth between the feet of both teams.

- As soon as the first half begins, a fierce midfield battle between the two teams ensues.

- Both Milan and Parma know this. If a goal isn't scored in the first half, it will be challenging to overturn the match in the second half.

- Yes, it's a match in the rain.

The winner of the fierce midfield battle started to emerge within three minutes of the first half.

With Bruno Cameroes and Ibrahim Kessie as their two defensive midfielders, AC Milan began to dominate possession in the center.

Naturally, Parma had no choice but to lower their line and move defensively.

Having lost the central battle for dominance.

It was impossible to ignore Bruno Cameroes' sharp passes while pressing high and pushing the line up.

- AC Milan takes the early momentum in the first half.

- Having secured the momentum, they will slowly start to target Parma.

AC Milan, having taken control.

Everyone watching the match thought.

That Milan would firmly hold the momentum until the end of the first half.

But Parma didn't just stand there and take it.

"Block it!"

"Connect it forward!"

Lautaro Valencia's tackle.

Followed by Marjan Kourtić's pass.

The ball was quickly connected forward.

- Mino!

- Mino grabs the ball and runs!

The ball was passed to Park Minho, who was exploiting the gap between the fullback and center-back.

- He's fast! Mino! Mino!

- Federico Calabria rushes to block him! Simon Kjær also closes the space for Mino to break through!

Waaahhhhh!

A huge cheer erupted.

Park Minho's feet moved even faster.

Federico's tackle splashed water.

Park Minho, who kicked the ball long and broke through, ran towards the center, with Simon Kjær on his side.

Minooo!

Parma fans who had come to Stadio Olimpico screamed Park Minho's name.

Simon Kjær felt a chilling sensation as he watched Park Minho, who didn't easily get pushed away.

Thud!

Park Minho, who was leaning on the defender's body, turned swiftly, shaking Simon Kjær.

Park Minho was not an attacker to miss such an opportunity.

“Uomo di merda!(Son of a bitch!)”

As Federico Calabria, who was rushing to follow Park Minho, spat out harsh words.

The ball left Park Minho's foot and drew a beautiful trajectory, shaking AC Milan's net.

Thwack!

Waaahhhhh!

A huge cheer erupted.

After scoring a goal within five minutes of the first half, Park Minho ran to the corner flag and slid on his stomach.

Swoosh!

Water splashed 'swoosh' as it sprayed.

Parma fans chanted a new cheer for Park Minho.

Parma has a god!

His name is Park Minho!

Park Minho! Park Minho!

Parma's god! Park Minho!

Flutter flutter!

The broadcast camera captured the Taegeukgi (South Korean flag) waving along with Park Minho's cheer.

Park Minho, who got up slowly, smiled brightly more than anyone else.

* * *

The goal was scored within five minutes of the first half.

Perhaps enraged by conceding that goal, AC Milan fiercely attacked us.

And within eleven minutes of the first half, AC Milan equalized.

- Gooooooal!

- Jeremy Saelemaekers! He scores the equalizer!

- As expected from the Coppa Italia final! AC Milan manages to score and catch up!

They are indeed strong.

AC Milan successfully penetrated Parma's temporarily exposed flank and scored.

Santiago clenched his fists in frustration.

The equalizing goal stemmed from Santiago's marking error, so he must be even more upset.

"Are you okay?"

"I'll nutmeg them next time."

"Yeah, do your best."

Santiago's eyes burned fiercely at my encouragement.

He must be really upset.

Just as we planned to attack aggressively in the first half, AC Milan seemed to want to widen the score in the first half.

If not, they wouldn't have fought so fiercely in the midfield.

Thanks to that, Willang Cyprien and Marjan Kourtić, who were positioned in the defensive midfield today, had expressions like they were about to die.

On the other hand, Franco, sitting on the bench, was watching the scene with a somewhat annoying expression.

When I initially heard that Franco would start the final on the bench, I was worried and approached to comfort him.

Looking at him now, I realize it was unnecessary.

His face was filled with happiness at avoiding the rain rather than the honor of playing in the final.

Let's focus back on the match.

It's our turn to counterattack now.

Franco might be annoying, but what can we do?

Well, if the match becomes chaotic, Franco will eventually have to play in the rain too.

I should run harder.

- The ball is passed to Mino!

- Parma fans shout Mino's name loudly every time he touches the ball!

- To Parma, Mino seems to be nothing short of a god!

Miiinooo!

As soon as I grabbed the ball, everyone called my name.

I slowly advanced with the ball.

Maybe because of the rain today, both AC Milan and our players' movements were dull.

Their actions were bigger.

Many couldn't maintain their balance.

Swoosh!

I bypassed Ibrahim Kessie, who tried to steal the ball from me, and drove forward.

As I advanced through the center, AC Milan's central defense moved in unison.

"He's coming!"

"Block the path!"

Contrary to Simon Kjær's shout.

AC Milan's players moved sluggishly.

To be precise, the slippery grass made it difficult for them to move as usual.

How do I move well?

When you run hard in the military field on a rainy day, you naturally learn how to use your body.

Compared to the military field, where poorly grown grass hinders soccer, this field is much more comfortable.

No, playing on such a good field.

If you can't control your own body, you're disqualified.

Isn't that right?

Miiinooo!

My name was called again.

The lightly touched ball accurately reached Kenneth's foot, who was charging like a tank towards the edge of the penalty area.

Boom!

A loud noise, as if the leather was about to burst.

As I watched Kenneth's shot shake AC Milan's net, I was convinced.

"Indeed, in a rain match, swamp soccer is the best."

Yes, in a rain match, swamp soccer is the best.

I'll work hard in the first half, score a hat-trick, and then lie down comfortably on the field in the second half.
