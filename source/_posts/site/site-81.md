## 29. Arsenal! Did you wait long? (4)

The attention directed towards Park Minho was immense.

Although his record included his time playing in Serie B, there were few teams that wouldn’t covet a striker who scored his 100th career goal within just two seasons of his debut.

However, PSG and Real Madrid seemed to have taken a step back, showing only lukewarm interest.

Real Madrid had Mbappé, and PSG was targeting Haaland, which might explain their lack of interest in Park Minho.

Moreover, with the recent spread of a new COVID variant, clubs had tightened their budgets once again.

As a result, only clubs that genuinely needed a striker or a second attacking option were left eyeing Park Minho.

Even so, many clubs desired Park Minho.

Thanks to his buyout clause of ‘52 million euros.’

“He’s dominant as a central striker, but he can also contribute effectively as a second striker.”

“Did you see that? The way he dribbled past the defense with juggling and then sped up immediately? That’s the reincarnation of Ronaldo! Ronaldo!”

“No, he seems more influenced by Baggio. Look at that fantastic shot! Doesn’t it remind you of Baggio? Plus, his nickname is ‘Fantastista’!”

Names of various legends were being tossed around.

From Ronaldo to Baggio, Messi, Gullit, Del Piero, Henry, Zidane, Lewandowski, and many more.

From past legends to the living legends who lead world football today, all their names came up.

But there was one thing on which these differing opinions agreed.

-His goal-scoring sense is truly phenomenal.

The sense to score goals.

Park Minho was born with that sense.

Everyone had to acknowledge it.

-Pedro Ocampos! Goooal!

-The score is back to 1-1! The second leg of the Europa League quarterfinals is unfolding similarly to the first leg!

Arsenal quickly caught up.

The moment the score was tied.

All eyes once again turned to Park Minho.

Expecting him to show something extraordinary.

And Park Minho met those expectations, eliciting cheers from the crowd.

“Minhoooooooo!”

“Waaaaaaaah!”

“Park! Minho! Park! Minho!”

In an instant, he broke through Arsenal’s flank.

Victor Bellerin, facing Park Minho directly.

Park Minho narrowly dodged Bellerin’s extended foot and sent in a cross.

The ball met Kenneth’s head and was directed to Filippo Asnelli, who had penetrated Arsenal’s danger zone.

Thud!

-Goooal! Here it is! Minho’s cross! Kenneth’s header! Filippo’s finish! An overwhelming attacking display by Parma’s proud trio this season!

-Look at Kenneth dropping the ball. Wow! What a clean assist!

This time it was the starting point.

The sharp cross from Park Minho’s foot ultimately shook Arsenal’s net.

“What are you doing? Focus!”

Arsenal’s defense, scolded by Ramsdale, pulled themselves together.

Interim coach Per Mertesacker quickly adjusted the tactics to counter Parma’s attack.

Did those adjustments work?

The first half ended with a score of 2-1.

* * *

The hooligans from England are known to be as rough as Italy’s ultras in European football circles.

They are so rough that their actions often make the news, drawing public criticism even outside the stadium.

Watching Arsenal trail 2-1 in the first half made the traveling fans’ curses even harsher.

“You bastards! Is this football? Losing by a point to these damn pasta guys, is this football?”

“Why did I come all the way to Parma to see this?”

“Focus! Arsenal!”

Moreover, the score widened at the start of the second half.

It was a goal created by Joshua’s cross.

-They’ve conceded again in the second half, making it 3-1.

-Another header goal by Kenneth, and Arsenal helplessly concedes another goal.

-Arsenal! They can’t stop Kenneth’s height or Minho’s breakthroughs.

The jeers from Arsenal’s traveling fans grew more intense.

Honestly, even we Parma fans curse like that when we’re losing.

Well, we haven’t lost many games this season, so we haven't had much reason to curse.

Anyway.

To some extent, I can understand the Arsenal fans.

It’s not like they’re not investing money anymore, they’re spending as much as others, but the results aren’t coming.

Moreover, Arsenal, which used to qualify for the Champions League consistently in the past, couldn’t get out of the Europa League now.

Though they had reached the Europa League quarterfinals with decent results, meeting us, they were now trailing by two points, increasing their chances of being eliminated from the Europa League.

If you ask if Arsenal is a weak team, the answer would be no, and that makes the fans even more frustrated.

This team has to achieve results and performance not only in the league but also in intercontinental tournaments.

But the current performance they’re showing?

They couldn’t narrow the 3-1 score gap and were slowly falling apart.

Of course, the fans couldn’t bear it.

How much longer could they hold out?

How frustrating it must be, as Lorenzo expressed dissatisfaction at Bernard Party’s clumsy pass.

As he passed by me, he grumbled in Italian, “This team is really strange.”

Anyway.

As the second half began, the flow of the game was somewhat sluggish in the midfield.

Parma’s home fans, winning by two points, could comfortably watch the situation, but the Arsenal fans who had traveled all the way were different.

They began to plead loudly for Arsenal to show a spirited performance.

In this situation, our coach started consolidating the game by substituting midfield and defensive resources.

Coach Alain, who usually shouts, “Attack! More goals!” sometimes enjoyed dropping the line and torturing the opponent.

Thanks to this, Arsenal became even more desperate.

-The passes are a bit inaccurate!

-Oh! Arsenal! They need to attack more calmly! There are still 20 minutes left!

-Knowing that, Parma is dropping the line and slowly breaking Arsenal’s tempo!

-Ah! The remaining time in the second half flows in the direction Parma wants!

Although we’re the team that has allowed quite a few goals despite being 1st in Serie A, our basic defense was quite solid.

When we confidently dropped the line, even Arsenal had to spend a lot of time trying to break through.

“Boooooo!”

Arsenal fans couldn’t help but be angry.

They weren’t happy with their team’s attack, and those damned Italians were starting to lie down.

But… why do I feel like I saw Monica near the away section?

I must have seen it wrong.

Yeah, there’s no way Monica would be there.

Actually… it wouldn’t be a big deal if she were there.

Even if she were, it wouldn’t change today’s result.

But I did feel a bit sorry.

Arsenal’s corner kick situation.

I took a moment to approach Joshua.

“Joshua! When I break into Arsenal’s final defensive line, send a long, high pass!”

Joshua nodded at my request.

Everyone dropped back.

I stood alone among Arsenal’s defenders.

Team White’s eyes, glaring at me, weren’t kind.

He must be wondering what on earth this guy is thinking, sticking close to the opposing defense like this.

Still, having come all the way to Parma, shouldn’t I give them a present?

Time passed gradually.

It was a little over 40 minutes into the second half.

Finally, the chance I had been waiting for seemed to arrive.

As Parma slowly circulated the ball after taking it away, Arsenal’s players aggressively pressured to steal it back.

Thanks to that, Arsenal’s defense was in disarray.

I didn’t miss the gap and quickly raised my hand while breaking through the defense.

Thump!

Joshua sent a long, high pass as I had requested.

Arsenal fans might have thought of a certain player watching my move.

As I swiftly noticed Ramsdale rushing out, I hurriedly dove and brought my head to the ball.

Thud!

-Goooal! An amazing diving header by Minho in the 42nd minute of the second half!

-Minhooo! He scores a brace against Arsenal, securing Parma’s spot in the Europa League semifinals with a decisive goal!

-A fantastic diving header reminiscent of Van Persie’s! Minhooo!

As soon as I scored, I ran toward the fans.

Fwoosh!

Sliding and spreading my arms, the home fans chanted my name like fanatics.

“Minhooooooo!”

“This is it! This is why I came to the stadium today!”

“Hahahahaha! Minho! Minho!”

“We’re going to the Europa League semifinals! The semifinals!”

Yes, it was the finishing goal signaling the end of today’s match.

Arsenal.

You’ve waited long, haven’t you?

This is my gift to you.

* * *

Monica secretly attended the match, hiding from Park Minho.

She wore an Arsenal replica with the number 24 and Park Minho’s name on it.

She prayed for Arsenal’s victory.

She imagined a scenario where Park Minho would score 3 goals, and Arsenal would score 4, making it to the Europa League semifinals.

But.

Arsenal began to crumble much more disastrously than she had expected.

Her mouth itched.

But she held back.

Yes, she thought Arsenal could overcome this crisis and show a different side in the second half.

But Parma dropped the line.

Arsenal couldn’t effectively break down Parma’s defense and wasted time.

“Hey! I could do better than you guys!”

Eventually, Monica’s anger exploded.

Her cheers grew more intense.

Then, she briefly made eye contact with Park Minho.

She quickly put on her sunglasses and looked away.

A little over 40 minutes into the second half.

She witnessed the image of a traitor that no Gooner would ever mention, in Park Minho’s final goal.

-Minhooo! A fantastic diving header!

-A diving header reminiscent of Van Persie!

Monica stared blankly at Park Minho.

Arsenal fans also closed their mouths and bowed their heads.

They were eliminated from the Europa League quarterfinals by the goal they least wanted.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

The whistle signaling the end of the match blew.

“Waaaaaaaah!”

Monica and the Gooners could only watch as Parma’s home fans rejoiced in reaching the Europa League semifinals after a long time.

Tears rolled down.

Monica shed tears.

Arsenal was eliminated from the Europa League quarterfinals.

-Park Minhooooo!

-Wow! How long has it been since we reached the Europa League semifinals? Please, let’s lift the third Europa League trophy this time!

-Parma! Parma! Parma!

-The last time was in 1999… Parma was so strong back then, but now it feels like we can forget the past!

-Grandfather… Are you watching? Parma is on the verge of a mini treble!

Parma’s advance to the Europa League semifinals.

Naturally, the city of Parma was engulfed in an atmosphere like a riot.

It was a bigger excitement than the previous season’s Coppa Italia win and the unbeaten Serie B championship.

Even elderly and middle-aged Parma fans were lighting flares and celebrating.

It was a short-lived glory that had come after a long period.

Of course, at the end of this season, most of the players who led Parma’s glory would be sold to other clubs.

That’s how Leicester’s fairy tale ended too.

But Parma still had a chance to write a more grand fairy tale than Leicester.

Yes, the club’s first mini treble in history.

Fans thought that moment would be enough to endure a short dark period.

And everyone’s eyes were on one player.

Parma’s god.

Parma’s Fantastista.

A national treasure sent from Korea.

The only striker who could gift Parma the mini treble.

Seeing Park Minho, Parma fans were convinced.

Parma’s fairy tale would have a beautiful ending.
