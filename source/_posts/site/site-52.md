## 19. The God of Parma (1)

Bruno Campos.

Born to a Brazilian father and an Algerian mother, he showed great talent in football from a young age.

His father, who was engaged in trade in Brazil, sent Bruno Campos and his mother to Portugal.

There, he spent his youth at Porto, the most prestigious club in the Portuguese league.

At first, it was tough.

Due to his lack of physicality, he couldn't easily compete among Porto's promising players.

Fortunately, from the age of 17, his body grew significantly, and that concern disappeared.

From the age of 18, he started to stand out distinctly, moved to Empoli in Italy, played 22 games, and recorded 2 goals and 3 assists.

After the first season, he met Leo Carpentieri and signed a contract.

In the second season, he played 31 games, scored 2 goals, and recorded 9 assists, showing explosive growth.

Eventually, after that season, he transferred to AC Milan.

He thought,

Football is really interesting.

It's truly an attractive sport.

After transferring to AC Milan, he faced many players.

Among them, the player who left the biggest impression on him was, of course, Jeremy Lukaku, the former Inter player who easily got past him and scored a goal.

But today, it seemed like things would change.

Tap-tap!

In the pouring rain, the monster named Minho was getting past him with a modified rainbow flick.

Rolling the ball with his right foot, he flicked it up with his standing foot.

The ball, now in the air, was lightly touched with the back of his right heel, going over both his and his opponent's heads.

Naturally, Bruno Campos had no choice but to be stunned.

He was just amazed that such delicate control was possible even in this rain.

"Chase him!"

A desperate voice came from behind.

Bruno hurried to follow, but Park Minho moved faster.

When Park Minho got past him, he used a rainbow flick, and in front of Viggo Kjær, he created a 1-on-1 chance with a back shot.

Beep!

And that critical situation was stopped by a foul from Mathias Tomori.

A yellow card was issued, leaving both central defenders with yellow cards, creating a precarious situation.

"Sorry. I should've defended better."

At Bruno's apology, Viggo smiled.

"How could anyone easily stop that jerk?"

"Someone's really going to get sent off at this rate."

That was truly dangerous just now.

But there was no other way.

Knowing that, neither Mathias Tomori nor Viggo Kjær said anything more.

Parma had a free-kick chance in the second half.

AC Milan's defenders looked at Parma's number 24 with weary expressions.

"Will he go for a knuckleball?"

"He might kick it with the outside of his foot instead."

"He'll definitely go for it directly, right?"

"Given how good his condition looks today, it's obvious. Remember when he got past Bruno? If he can control the ball so delicately in this pouring rain, he'll definitely go for it directly."

Everyone's eyes were on Park Minho.

Unlike before, Park Minho slowly raised his hand.

He ran towards the ball with the referee's whistle.

Thud!

The ball went slightly low.

The moment Bruno saw the ball, he noticed the 2-meter giant who had lightly shoved Viggo Kjær away to hold his position.

-Keneeeeeeeth!

-Header! Ah! Kaiky Miñón saves it!

-Second ball! Gennaro Tatis shoots!

-Gooooooal!

The score widened to 4-3 again.

Milan's players looked at Park Minho, who took a fantastic free-kick, and Kenneth, who used his solid body to push away Milan's iron wall, Viggo Kjær, with exhausted expressions.

Bruno clenched his fist as he watched Park Minho quietly return to his position.

Indeed.

Football was truly a fascinating sport.

* * *

"Damn, that didn't go in."

My dream car slipped away.

Such a shame.

In the meantime, Kenneth, who had returned to his position after the celebration, looked at me like a shepherd seeking praise.

I gave him a thumbs-up, and he grinned.

A Moai statue smiling.

It felt like the world's seven wonders had increased to eight.

A smirking Moai statue?

I can't handle that.

The game, now leading 4-3.

As the coach said, we decided to bring out a new plan.

The game resumed.

But it was different from before.

We parked the bus.

Intentionally playing rough, we continuously drained Milan's stamina.

Ah, I wanted a hat-trick.

But there's no choice if we want to win.

When we intercepted the ball, we didn't recklessly counter-attack; instead, we passed the ball around slowly, making Milan's players realize.

They understood that we were doing everything to maintain this lead.

Naturally, the ones in a hurry moved busily.

"Jeremy! Yannick! Push up! Go higher!"

"Score a goal no matter what!"

"Samuele!"

Unlike before, when Andrea Celentano, Milan's coach, quietly watched the game, he now roamed the technical zone like a colt with its tail on fire, shouting.

But it was already too late.

In the first half, Milan's midfielders, who had fought for dominance with us in the center, had now stopped.

Their legs felt heavy.

Moreover, we had a great opportunity to experience how spongy the waterlogged pitch was.

"Get up!"

As I lay briefly after slipping from a tackle, Abraham Kessie grabbed my arm and pulled me up.

"Thanks, buddy!"

He walked away without responding to my thanks.

He seemed really pissed.

Still, with everyone except me on defense, Milan's marking seemed oddly loose.

If one long pass connected to the front, I saw a chance to sprint and score.

But I just gave up.

"Ugh!"

As Santiago got slightly hit on the elbow and rolled three times enthusiastically, I shook my head.

Yeah, let's torment them a bit more.

It would be a shame to stop such fun now, right?

Besides, there were still 20 minutes left.

I was confident I could score one more goal in that time.

-Parma is completely sitting back!

-For Milan, this must be frustrating. They had a good momentum, scoring three goals in the first half, right?

-The problem is, Parma also came out attacking, scoring three goals in the first half, and in the second half, they scored first, making Milan the chasing team.

-It's not good. Parma knows Milan is tired now.

Slowed steps.

Milan had no choice but to start making substitutions first.

Federico Calabria, who had been swung around by me on the right all game, was subbed out for Claude Kalulu.

The second substitution saw Junior Kessias come in for Samuele Pellegrini.

The third substitution saw Yannick Dias subbed out, and Parte Cavicci entered the field.

They brought in a defensive player and a midfielder to quickly carry the ball on the flank.

Finally, they brought in an agile forward who could break the line and score.

Simultaneously, Parma also made substitutions.

Willan, who worked hard in today's match, was replaced by Franco Vazquez.

One defender was also changed.

As soon as Franco entered the game, he quickly approached me for corner kick defense.

"Ugh... I hate playing in the rain."

I burst into a smile at his grumbling.

But what could be done?

Franco was the only one in Parma who could deliver a clean forward pass for a counter-attack.

"Block it!"

Milan's ensuing corner kick.

Milan kept up their fierce attack as the ball, headed by Lautaro Valencia, went far.

I quietly moved up to take my position.

Both Bruno Campos and Mathias Tomori had moved up to a higher line to join the attack.

Thanks to that, I saw an opportunity for a counter-attack from a slightly separated position from Viggo Kjær.

"It looks like one is going to go in."

Before that, I thought it would be better to score one more for peace of mind, so I looked around.

At that moment, Kenneth and I made eye contact.

Ah, of all people, Kenneth?

I know he's good.

But his passing is always lacking.

Still, what can you do?

No one works as hard as Kenneth.

-Giovanni's save!

-Kenneth gets the ball and kicks it long!

-Minho! Minho is running!

I ran to match the long shot.

Viggo Kjær, who was beside me, looked flustered.

He quickly followed.

-Viggo! He's following Minho closely!

Viggo Kjær couldn't completely block me, but he quickly caught up beside me with his fast legs.

Swish!

Seeing me give a slight feint and appear to pass to the center, he quickly stretched out his foot.

Oh? His foot is a bit high?

I saw this as an opportunity.

Tap!

"Ugh!"

After kicking the ball long, I moved forward and tripped over Viggo Kjær's foot.

As I fell, I briefly glanced at Viggo's face. It seemed he realized his mistake at that moment.

-Oh! A foul! The referee pulls out a yellow card! Yes! It's the second yellow card! It's a send-off! Viggo Kjær is sent off here!

-Oh! The tackle was too deep and high!

-Milan! At the worst possible moment, they're trailing 4-3, and this happens!

Booo!

Waaaaah!

Viggo Kjær held his head in his hands.

Other Milan players ran to the referee to protest, but the referee's decision didn't change.

I lay there briefly, clutching my foot, while the Rossoneri's boos felt as comfortable as a lullaby.

* * *

-I Love Milan: ...

-Real Milan: LOL Milan is screwed LOL

-Roberto: Aaah! Great! Just hold on for 15 more minutes! Just 15 more minutes!

-King Wang Jang Juve: Milan's key defender Viggo Kjær is out. Our Minho will definitely get a hat trick now.

-Monica: <20 Types of Sports Cars Suitable for Park Minho, Who Will Become an Arsenal Legend>

-Roberto: Arsenal? Our Minho is the God of Parma... Why is he an Arsenal legend?

The moment Viggo Kjær got sent off.

The group chat quickly filled with messages mocking one Rossoneri.

-Oh! Now Milan has to play with 10 men!

-The free-kick position is good too.

-Since Minho has already scored a free-kick goal today, Milan will be even more cautious.

-Milan is using their fourth substitution card.

-They're reinforcing the midfield.

Due to the lingering effects of COVID-19, teams were allowed up to five substitution cards.

Milan quickly changed their midfielders, setting up a 3-5-1 formation.

Meanwhile, the free-kick situation began.

Park Minho raised his hand high and took the free-kick.

Fortunately, Milan survived the crisis.

They started a counter-attack after catching the ball.

-Oh... Milan! This doesn't look good!

-Parma is completely sitting back!

-Milan has no choice but to be urgent!

Still, the top club in Serie A showed its class.

Even in this crisis, they managed to score a goal.

The goal scorer was Parte Cavicci, who had been subbed in.

-Parte Cavicci!

-Gooooooal! Parte Cavicci!

-He saves Milan in this crisis! The score is now 4-4! Milan catches up to tie the game!

Waaaaah!

A huge cheer echoed through the Stadio Olimpico.

With Milan's equalizer in the 40th minute of the second half, Giovanni Buffon kicked the innocent pitch in frustration.

Lautaro Valencia, who missed marking Parte Cavicci, sighed as he looked at the pouring sky.

Now the situation for both teams had changed.

With one man down, Milan no longer had to be urgent.

Parma, on the other hand, had no reason to extend the game to extra time or penalties, so they had to attack.

Milan fans who had come to the Stadio Olimpico started singing their chants loudly, unlike before.

Meanwhile, Parma fans could only desperately chant one player's name.

Park! Minho!

Park! Minho!

Park! Minho!

And.

Living up to their expectations, in the 45th minute of the second half, with 4 minutes of added time given, the ball connected to Park Minho's feet.

Park Minho slowly advanced with the ball.

AC Milan's defenders gulped as they watched him.

* * *

Viggo Kjær is an outstanding player.

He has most of the abilities a center-back should have, making him one of the best defenders in Serie A.

But without him, AC Milan's defense didn't seem that intimidating to me.

Tap-tap!

I slowly advanced with the ball.

AC Milan's three-back, consisting of Gerard Hernandez, Mathias Tomori, and Claude Kalulu, looked vulnerable.

Compared to the iron-clad defense coordinated by Viggo Kjær, this defense was like Swiss cheese with holes.

Moreover, except for Claude Kalulu, Milan's defenders were all exhausted.

Of course, I wasn't in perfect condition either.

My legs had slowed down.

But it was enough to get past this defense.

-Minho! Pass to the center and return!

-The only player Parma can rely on is Minho! They must score here! If it goes to penalties, anything can happen!

"Ugh!"

I easily got past Abraham Kessie, who charged at me with a desperate voice, and moved into the half-space.

Gerard Hernandez quickly rushed forward to block my path.

I lightly slipped the ball and moved, and our Kenneth caught the ball and returned it to me.

-Kenneth! And Minho!

-A perfect 2-on-1 pass!

Facing Mathias Tomori, I paid back our cheeky player's revenge and finished.

"No!"

I could feel Mathias Tomori's despairing gaze as he looked at me after getting nutmegged.

At the same time, I felt my uniform being pulled.

But my shot didn't falter.

Thud!

The ball brushed past the goalkeeper's hand and went in.

As soon as I made it 4-4, the Rossoneri, who had been singing loudly, fell silent.

I jumped up and started running towards the Parma fans.

-Waaaaah! Minho's hat-trick! Hat-trick! Minhooooo!

-With just one minute left in added time, Minho delivers a fatal blow to Milan!

-Waaaaah! Minhooooo! Minhooooo! Park Minhooooo!

I ran fast,

Jumped over the advertising board, and ran towards the Parma fans, shouting loudly.

"Yes! I'm the God of Parma! Let's go for one more year! I'll bring home the Europa League trophy next year! Got it? Got it?"

"I'm your god! God! I'll bring all the trophies Parma wants! Praise me more!"

At my frenzied shout, Parma fans screamed louder and went wild.

One fan I made eye contact with even fainted.

When I saw a female fan throw her panties at me, I momentarily thought of Monica's dead eyes and got scared.

Anyway.

The Parma fans now seemed like they would pretend to die if I told them to.

Watching that, I thought.

Hmm... Am I really a god?
