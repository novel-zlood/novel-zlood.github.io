## 49. New Plans (2)

After finishing all the A-match schedules and returning to London, Bruno asked me with a curious look.

"Minho, what kind of player is Fabian?"

When asked what kind of player Fabian Pavone is, the first thing that comes to mind is that he has no major weaknesses.

Fabian Pavone, who has no significant weaknesses, consistently performed in all aspects of offense and defense on Parma's right flank.

A hexagonal flank midfielder.

That's how you can evaluate Fabian Pavone.

Of course, that is not necessarily a strength.

Just because he has no major weaknesses doesn't make him an invincible player.

While he has decent abilities, he often lacks the strengths to overwhelm opponents, and if his form is just slightly off, he can be easily swayed and crumble on his own.

Moreover, being stable can also mean lacking explosiveness.

"Really? He seems like a player with a faint presence."

Just like his playing style, Fabian's presence was surprisingly faint and colorless.

The impression I had of Fabian Pavone was similar to a character from PoX Monster who just makes rice for you.

The fans' reactions weren't bad.

"Fabian Pavone's recruitment is a replacement for Kamiyasu Takehiro, who will leave for Juventus or Atletico Madrid!"

"Coach Alain Lavagne plans to use Fabian, a flank winger, as a wing-back!"

"Fabian Pavone played only 151 minutes last season! He was not part of Coach Rui Carzo's plans!"

"Trusted Parma products? Arsenal is gradually increasing the number of players from Parma!"

-Who is Fabian Pavone?

-He is a consistent winger who led Parma to the Serie A championship in the 22-23 season along with Minho. His performance is stable, always contributing to the team.

-It seems like they plan to use him as a wing-back?

-Our coach has worked with him before, so he knows how to utilize him well.

-He can't perfectly replace Kamiyasu, but until Robledo grows, he can hold the fort!

-There's a shortage of full-backs recently. For this price, I don't think it's bad.

These days, fans have an eye for expertise, don't they?

This is why the internet is called the sea of information.

Now, the only thing left is who to bring in to replace Ødegaard.

Honestly, I hope Ødegaard stays.

There are rumors that acting club owner Jade Kronke personally reached out to Ødegaard, so I hope a smooth negotiation is underway.

Anyway.

While I was spending my remaining vacation after returning to London, the Euros were in full swing.

"Minho, who do you think will win the Euros?"

Monica was wearing a strange jersey that was half England and half Italy.

"At least, not England."

England, who won the 2022 Qatar World Cup.

However, their performance in the Euros was far from the level of a World Cup-winning team.

It was understandable that the media had a field day criticizing England's performance after a 2-2 draw with Scotland in the group stage.

Amani Richards was fighting alone in the match...

I couldn't believe it.

How bad must England be if that slacker Amani has to be the mainstay?

"Minho, Amani is a top-tier striker in the league! Aren't you underestimating him too much?"

"Is that so?"

"Yes, Minho scored 70 goals in a season, and Lorenzo scored 40, so... But Amani is also an amazing winger with 22 goals and 13 assists in a season!"

Hmm... Listening to Monica, I wondered if I had underestimated Amani.

But looking at his usual behavior, he really reminds me of Man Utd's Josh Lingard.

"He feels like Lucky Lingard."

"What?"

"Nothing."

I felt sorry for Monica, but Amani's image to me was really like Lucky Lingard.

[Amani Richards! Injured in the match against Switzerland!]

And this Lucky Lingard ended his first Euros with a three-week injury in the last group stage match against Switzerland.

Fortunately, England collected points against Spain and Switzerland and advanced to the round of 16 as the second in their group.

Their round of 16 opponent was Portugal.

It wasn't an easy match, but thanks to Harriet Kane's performance, they succeeded in advancing to the quarterfinals.

And England's quarterfinal opponent was...

[England vs. Germany! The eternal rivals face off in the Euro 2024 quarterfinals!]

[Italy vs. Wales, Turkey vs. France, Poland vs. Norway, and England vs. Germany!]

It was 'Germany,' the eternal rival of England.

* * *

-The winner of Euro 2024 is Italy!

-Italy wins back-to-back Euros following their previous victory!

-Italy redeems themselves from their poor performance in the 2022 Qatar World Cup!

The winner of this Euro is Italy.

No one predicted Italy's victory due to their scoring drought after Lorenzo Lupo's injury in the quarterfinals.

England, who lost key players like Harriet Kane to injury in the semifinals, showed worse performance than Italy and created a perfect upset in the final.

The sight of England fans, who thought this was the perfect time for England to win the Euros, holding their heads and crying on the broadcast screen showed how shocking England's runner-up finish was.

Monica, wearing an Italy jersey and singing the Italian national anthem in front of me, performed a shocking act.

I felt I could agree with Roberto's claim that 'Monica's nationality is Arsenal!'

As soon as the European festival ended, the transfer market began to move actively again.

[Kamiyasu! Transferred to Juventus! Transfer fee: 73 billion won!]

First, Kamiyasu left for Juventus.

We brought in Fabian to replace Kamiyasu, so I didn't see any major problems.

Having experienced him at Parma, I judged that he could play as a wing-back without any issues.

Our coach, who has an eye for players as good as mine, would surely show a successful transition of Fabian to a wing-back.

[Arsenal successfully renews the contract with Ødegaard for 5 more years!]

The contract renewal with Ødegaard was also completed.

Ødegaard, who had remained silent until the end of the Euros, was considering an offer from PSG but eventually signed a 5-year contract with Arsenal, staying with us until he is 31 years old.

Arsenal didn't make any significant moves in this transfer market.

They sold Kamiyasu.

Brought in Fabian Pavone.

And finished by renewing contracts and tidying up the squad.

On the other hand, other teams were very busy.

[Manuel Felix of Atletico Madrid transfers to Liverpool for 223 billion won!]

[Atletico Madrid's ace heads to Liverpool!]

[Big signing! Liverpool adds young talent Manuel Felix to their aging attacking lineup!]

Liverpool first brought in Manuel Felix, who was essentially leading Atletico Madrid.

As Abraham Salah's skills were gradually declining at 31 years old, Liverpool seemed to see Manuel Felix as a potential replacement for Salah.

Though their playing styles are completely different.

Liverpool fans seemed to believe that Manuel Felix could adequately replace Salah.

[Man Utd! Signs Barcelona's rising star Aches Parti for approximately 233 billion won!]

[A huge influx of capital in the EPL! Man Utd wants to win!]

[Man Utd's overflowing attacking midfielders! Is Junseo Shin being pushed to the bench?]

Man Utd spent a huge amount of money recklessly.

Despite having plenty of decent attacking midfielders, they seemed unsatisfied with their attacking power and brought in Barcelona's rising star Aches Parti for 100 billion won more than Manuel Felix.

In my opinion, Man Utd's most lacking area is central defense.

But Man Utd ended their defensive reinforcements by signing left-back Rodrigo Santos from Juventus as a free agent.

[Man Utd's coach Helge unhappy?]

[Coach Helge: 'The board ignored my request for a central defender and signed Aches Parti. He's not a bad player, but... Man Utd urgently needs a central defender.']

I think the problem with Man Utd is not the coach or the squad but the overly aggressive board.

Man Utd and Liverpool.

The two teams' big signings stirred up the transfer market.

But Southampton also made a splash.

[Southampton signs Napoli's star striker James Osimen for 82 billion won!]

[Southampton, who qualified for the Champions League, makes a bold move!]

[Coach Galma Gerdolf: 'I believe we are a team capable of challenging for the championship.']

Southampton's move caused ripples in the EPL pond.

[Man City signs 'Karun Topmeiners' from Atalanta for 99 billion won!]

[Newcastle also steps in! Invests 100 billion won to sign 'Dudu,' Inter's right-back!]

[EPL's trend of big signings continues! A storm of huge funds in the transfer market!]

The EPL saw a rush of high-value signings.

Even lower-tier teams spent up to 450 billion won strengthening their squads, making the EPL clubs' moves unusually intense this season.

However, there were naturally EPL teams that showed a completely different approach.

Apart from Arsenal, there were just two teams in the EPL that remained silent in the transfer market.

The first was Arsenal's North London rival, Tottenham, led by the stingy Chairman Levy.

[Tottenham with 'zero signings' again? Uninterested in this transfer market?]

[Spurs fans are unhappy! 'We want a player like Minho!']

[Tottenham's first signing is James Sorkin, who they sent to Sunderland in the 21/22 season?]

[Spurs fans are furious! Re-signing a player they sent to the third division?]

The Spurs fans were naturally furious.

While other teams were spending at least 50 billion won on players, Tottenham pulled a stunt by re-signing James Sorkin, who they had sent to Sunderland, for four times the original price.

I was thankful that London didn't explode.

Despite the Spurs' anger, Tottenham remained passive in the transfer market.

Even though they had enough money.

Some Spurs fans voiced opinions like, 'Maybe we'll hear some good news at the end of the transfer window?' suggesting a wait-and-see approach.

The second team that was passive in the transfer market was Chelsea.

This was somewhat understandable.

After all the bad events that hit Chelsea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Fortunately, the club owner changed.

But they must be busy with internal restructuring.

Chelsea fans seemed to understand and endure it.

While the EPL was buzzing with transfers, my vacation was coming to an end.

"Time flies like light."

June passed, and July arrived.

The summer signaling a new season had come.

It meant it was time to return to training after a short yet long vacation.

"Minho! Long time no see."

"Hey, Fabian! How have you been?"

Despite his faint impression, Fabian looked surprisingly bright.

"How's Parma?"

"Well... Everyone's pretty much the same as before."

"Really?"

Hearing about Kenneth and Joshua made me smile.

Knowing those troublemakers were still the same oddly reassured me.

"I struggled a lot last season because I didn't fit the coach's style, but the other guys didn't have that issue, so I was a bit envious."

Fabian had a tough time last season.

I heard he didn't fit the coach's style and spent the season without proper playing time, which worried him.

Soon, other players arrived.

I introduced Fabian to the Arsenal squad.

Fortunately, despite his faint impression, Fabian didn't seem to have any personality issues integrating into the team.

He was a player who quietly blended into the squad even at Parma.

Eventually, all the players gathered.

Lorenzo, who won the Euros, appeared with a mischievous smile, unfazed by the fierce glares of the England players who finished as runners-up.

His mental strength was commendable.

He really... is something else.

Soon, Coach Alain Lavagne appeared on the training ground.

Our coach... His hair looked significantly fuller, making me wonder if he had a hair transplant during the vacation.

The coach greeted the players lightly and discussed his new plans for the season.

"We will use two tactics this season."

"When the opponent actively uses a defensive midfielder, we will use the 4-2-3-1 formation, the A tactic."

"When the opponent uses an attacking midfielder, we will use the asymmetrical 4-3-3 formation, the B tactic."

It was definitely different from last season.

Last season, we adjusted one formation based on the opponent's tactics. This time, we plan to switch between two base tactics depending on the opponent's tactics.

The players listened attentively, focusing on the coach's new plans.

"The preseason is very short. In this brief period, we must master both formations."

"That means..."

"Yes! It means we will train very hard!"

At the coach's shout, the players frowned.

Intense training from the preseason.

It seemed this season wouldn't be easy either.

Such thoughts filled my mind.

"Move! Move! Move! Quickly!"

The players lined up and began running to warm up in response to the coach's shout.

Arsenal's preseason had finally begun.
