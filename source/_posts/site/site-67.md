## 24. Qatar World Cup (3)

It's been a year and a few months since I made my professional debut and many things have changed.

First, my body has been shaped to match the word 'professional,' unlike before.

Second, many more people who like football know me than I expected.

I realized why sudden stars get absorbed in celebrity syndrome as soon as I arrived in Qatar.

From morning till evening.

I often saw cameras clicking nonstop at Junseo hyung and me from a distance.

I remember my mother saying that reporters would come to our house. From what I heard, she managed to sell insurance to five reporters and was thankful for it.

I sometimes think.

If my mother had been my agent instead of Leo, we might not have lost anything.

Of course, it's a light joke.

Anyway.

The atmosphere in the Korean team, which won the evaluation match by a large margin, was naturally good.

But it wasn't all good.

Korea had the lowest FIFA ranking and the lowest level of players in Group H.

The biggest concern was whether we could survive this group of death.

Korea has always been an underdog in the World Cup.

Except for 2002, we have never reached the quarterfinals.

Considering that we made it to the round of 16 for the first time in 2010, Korea is still on the periphery of the global football scene.

- The first match is the most important.
- That's right. And the opponent is Morocco. If we faced France or the Netherlands right from the start... we would have had a high chance of being eliminated with three straight losses.

Experts evaluated that it was lucky for Korea to have Morocco as the first match in Group H.

Meeting France or the Netherlands from the start... it would have been terrifying even for me.

[South Korean National Team! Defeat Morocco!]
[To advance to the round of 16, South Korea must win the first match!]
[Special mission for Korea's defense! Stop Chelsea's Nabil Ziyech and Munich's Achraf En-Nesyri!]
[If we don't get points against Morocco, the World Cup ends here!]

Both domestic and foreign media evaluated that South Korea had to defeat Morocco to advance to the round of 16.

I nodded in agreement.

Because it's true.

This is the reality.

Although South Korea is gradually improving, it is still on the fringes of the global football scene.

But I wasn't planning to give up easily.

Given my late debut, my opportunities in the World Cup are far fewer compared to other players.

So, I have to work harder.

Yes, if I work hard, good results will follow.

It would be great if we could win the World Cup.

Honestly, that's almost impossible even if I were to be reborn.

But isn't the semi-finals possible?

"Manwook-ah! How could you tackle like that?"

I saw senior Kim Manwook knock down Junseo hyung with an absurd tackle.

Yeah, even if the semi-finals are impossible, we can make it to the quarterfinals.

I cautiously lowered my goal by one step.

But then, seeing Seungjae miss a perfect chance made me ponder deeply.

Can we really make it to the quarterfinals with this squad?

Even making it to the round of 16 would be an incredible achievement, wouldn't it?

I felt my judgment becoming increasingly blurred.

* * *

Morocco.

A strong team from North Africa, treated as a dark horse in the World Cup with outstanding players.

Notably, Nabil Ziyech, who transferred from Ajax to Chelsea and is showing great performances, and Achraf En-Nesyri from Munich lead the attack.

Moreover, most of their main players are playing in the top four European leagues, and their substitutes are active in the French, Portuguese, and Dutch leagues.

It's not an easy team.

But having faced strong teams like Inter, AC Milan, and AS Roma with Parma, I was confident that it wasn't an overly difficult opponent.

[Nabil Ziyech, 'Morocco must defeat Korea to advance to the round of 16.']
[Achraf En-Nesyri, 'If a team loses to Korea, it’s certain they'll be eliminated from the round of 16.']

With interviews like these, it was clear that South Korea was perceived as the lowest in Group H.

France and the Netherlands likely had similar thoughts.

But I believed we could win.

I judged that South Korea could fight well enough.

If it were any other team, maybe not, but we had to beat Morocco.

Doha’s Ras Abu Aboud Stadium.

This stadium near the coast was built with shipping containers and other recycled materials.

I heard it would be dismantled after this World Cup and used for other construction projects nationwide.

So.

This meant that this moment was the only chance to play in this stadium.

Knowing that made me want to win this match even more.

- The match between South Korea and Morocco will take place at Ras Abu Aboud Stadium.

- Group H is truly a group of death. While it will be a tough series of matches for South Korea, we sincerely hope our Taeguk Warriors will secure a victory.

It definitely felt different from a typical international match.

It was a match fitting the description of a global festival.

As I entered the field and looked around.

The atmosphere was quite different from the usual Serie A and Europa League matches.

Morocco started to show confident football against South Korea.

Because we were the easiest opponent in Group H.

They probably entered the field with the mindset that they must win against us.

But they didn't let their guard down.

They pushed us with their excellent organization and individual skills, utilizing their physicality.

Coach Pedro advised us that we must not concede a goal in the first half.

Just like other Arab countries, Morocco was notorious for playing 'bed football' in the African region.

Morocco was an opponent we absolutely must not lose to, even if it ended in a draw.

- Tarik Elyounoussi intercepts! The play is disrupted from the side! South Korea is in danger!

- Today’s attacks from the side linked to South Korea aren't smooth! The passes keep getting intercepted by Tarik Elyounoussi!

A little over 20 minutes into the first half.

It was already the third time South Korea allowed an interception to Tarik Elyounoussi.

Thanks to that, Junseo hyung's characteristic annoyed expression was evident on his face.

“This is serious.”

Hearing my muttering, Morocco’s side defender Michel Mazraoui gave me a puzzled look and asked in English.

What do you mean?

“Don’t worry, it’s not an insult.”

I kindly replied in English, and he squinted his eyes.

I’m serious, it’s not an insult.

Anyway, the game wasn't easy.

We were being outmatched physically.

Their individual skills were also impressive.

Due to injuries and various circumstances, South Korea had no choice but to use young players in the midfield and attack, resulting in a significant difference in organization.

As a result, we were pushed back throughout the first half.

Fortunately, two super saves by Lee Minjun from Fenerbahçe saved the team.

Goalkeeper Song Minjae sighed in relief.

- The score between the two teams is still 0-0!

- South Korea! You need to push a bit harder!

Morocco's perfect chance came again.

This time it was Nabil Ziyech.

He was showing why he plays for Chelsea on the field.

- Zi-yeech!

- Thankfully, it goes over the post!

- Dangerous! South Korea! You're just getting hit!

We kept getting pushed back.

But we weren't just being pushed around.

Led by Junsik, the young South Korean midfield gradually started to take control from Morocco with their characteristic activity.

And after a brief trial and error.

Finally, South Korea began its attack.

Junseo hyung and I positioned ourselves at the forefront.

As it was difficult to dominate the midfield.

The ball passed from Yongchul to Lee Junsik.

Junsik, who moved from the center to the side, made a long pass forward.

Junseo hyung and I just ran forward.

- Shin Junseo! And Park Minho! They’re running!

- Morocco's defense is focused on marking South Korea's two proud attackers!

The Moroccan players followed Junseo hyung and me.

Fortunately, it was Junseo hyung who got to the ball first.

I moved diagonally behind Michel Mazraoui, and keen Junseo hyung passed the ball to me.

A perfectly timed pass.

Without thinking, I made a one-touch return pass over the defense.

- Shin Junseo! Shin Junseo! And! Goooal!

- Goooal! South Korea scores with their first counterattack!

- A goal in the 31st minute of the first half!

- South Korea's ace! Shin Junseo scores South Korea's first goal in the World Cup finals!

- Oh! Look at Park Minho's sharp pass! It's almost as if he spoon-fed the goal!

If he missed this, he should give up being South Korea's ace.

Even our team's slacker wouldn’t miss this pass.

I'm not mocking.

It was genuinely a chance close to perfection.

After his signature knee slide, Shin Junseo hyung looked at the camera and did a click celebration.

South Korea!

Waaaaah!

Anyway.

With the first goal scored, we could now manage the game with a bit more peace of mind.

On the other hand, Morocco seemed very urgent.

The movements of Nabil Ziyech and Achraf En-Nesyri became more aggressive right after we scored the first goal.

- Ah! Morocco! They're in a hurry!

- From the moment they fell behind 1-0, Morocco's attacks keep getting disrupted!

- Another counterattack from South Korea! Morocco is shaken!

The thought that one more goal would seal the deal dominated my mind.

As soon as the ball connected to me, I ran.

It seemed like I was showing dribble breakthroughs in the South Korean team as often as I ate, something I hadn't shown much this season.

- Park Minho! Park Minho!

- He passes two players in an instant! He's fast! Morocco's defense isn't prepared yet!

- Shin Junseo is cutting inside! And Park Sangbin is running on the opposite side!

- Morocco's defense has only four players! It's a situation where they can definitely create a chance!

Seeing the two players spread wide to the sides, I sped up and ran through the center.

Morocco's central defender, Bayran Saiss, looked at me with a bewildered expression and slipped under my back shot.

- Park Minho! Park Minho!

- He breaks through! And!

- Shoooot! Goooal!

- In just three minutes after the first goal, South Korea leads Morocco 2-0!

- Park Minho! Amazing! What a breakthrough! A goal created by running 40 meters alone!

I pounded the national team emblem on my left chest and ran to the stands where the Taegukgi was fluttering.

Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho!

It didn't feel as catchy as "Park Minho" but still, the cheer carried a sense of pride, and it wasn’t bad.

As I kept pounding the emblem while looking at the Taegukgi, the cheering for my name grew louder.

“You crazy guy! You’re really crazy!”

“We’re 2-0 against Morocco! We are!”

“We might really make it to the round of 16! Really!”

Other players rushed at me.

They were incredibly happy.

With this decisive goal, Morocco had no choice but to become more urgent.

On the contrary, we were completely fueled up.

But.

It’s too early to be happy.

It’s not over yet.

- Park Minho! How did he get here?

- And! Shooot!

- Goooal! Park Minho scores a multi-goal! South Korea leads Morocco 3-0 at the end of the first half!

- Unbelievable! South Korea! A team many predicted would be the first to be eliminated in Group H! South Korea creates a 3-goal difference against Morocco in the first half!

Waaaaaah!

The tremendous cheers pierced my ears.

Shoooosh!

I couldn't hold back this time.

Monica told me not to do knee slides because of my knees.

I spread my arms and did a knee slide.

“Park Minho! Park Minho!”

“Minho-yaaaa!”

“Waaaah! The best! The best!”

“South Korea! Hooray!”

A giant Taegukgi fluttered.

The ecstatic Red Devils were calling my name with tears in their eyes.

Seeing them made me smile.

How could I not be thrilled receiving their cheers?

The heavy label of 'national team' was oddly making my heart race today.

Now I understood why Buffon wanted to stay in the national team.

Why Junseo hyung endured long flights to respond to the nation's call.

This is a drug.

A drug the nation allows.

A drug called 'national pride.'

* * *

Beep! Beep! Beeeeep!

- Waaaah! South Korea secures their first win in the Qatar World Cup with a 4-2 victory against Morocco!

- This increases South Korea's chances of advancing to the round of 16! It's truly moving!

In the second half, Morocco continued their offensive.

But our youngest, Yongchul's fantastic long-range shot shook the net, completely extinguishing their momentum.

Thanks to that, we managed to finish the game 4-2 after being chased to 3-2.

I was certain after today’s match.

South Korea's attacking power is among the best in the world.

At the same time, there was a cause for concern.

Without Lee Minjun, our defense could concede goals even against China.

The South Korean defense, which conceded two goals consecutively to Nabil Ziyech at the beginning of the second half, cooled down my heart filled with national pride.

Could we really secure even a single point against France and the Netherlands in this state?

I judged it to be absolutely impossible.

[South Korea! Secures their first win in the Qatar World Cup with a 4-2 victory!]
[A joyful yet uneasy South Korea! Coach Pedro worried about the unbalanced squad!]
[An attack capable of scoring against Europe's best! A defense that could concede to Asia's weakest!]
[The Netherlands! A 1-0 victory against France!]
[Chaos in Group H! A group of death indeed, with even global gamblers shaking their heads!]

Just as I feared, the media questioned the unbalanced squad of the South Korean team, despite the victory.

- Monica: You were amazing!
- Monica: Minho! Make sure to beat France too! Got it?
- Monica: Love you!

With Monica’s encouragement, I wanted to win against France.

However, the shaky defense eventually broke.

[South Korea! Disappointing narrow defeat!]
[A 3-2 loss! The South Korean defense groans with the injury of key defender Kim Youngsoo!]
[South Korea's attack snatches two goals against France! But the defense drags them down!]
[Such a regrettable result! France defeats South Korea, plunging Group H into a mystery!]
[Morocco defeats the Netherlands!]
[Morocco secures a 2-1 victory against the Netherlands!]
[All four teams in Group H now have one win and one loss! The result fitting the label 'group of death'!]

- Hahahahahahahaha
- Ah! We're screwed!
- The rare King's move!
- We're ahead on goal difference, so a draw will secure second place! Please, Dutch brothers ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
- Of all times to face the Netherlands.
- Truly a guillotine match here?
- I'm tired of seeing all these scenarios!
- I don't even hope for a win! Just please get a draw so we can taste the round of 16! Please?

The chaotic situation in Group H.

With Morocco defeating the Netherlands, it was unclear who would advance to the round of 16.

In such a situation, the only match left for South Korea was against the Netherlands.
