## 21. A Player Smiling Even When the Team is Losing! (3)

Inter is different.

While making it 2-2, I ran out of stamina, but they blocked my shooting position like a ghost.

Still, I scored a goal to tie the game.

For now, I'm satisfied.

But the game isn't over yet.

Inter also replaced the defenders who were being swayed by me.

They quickly calmed the chaos.

"Minho!"

It seemed like Kenneth was in good form today.

His passes and ball touches were cleaner than usual.

Of course, it's still just league-average level.

But in today's game, he was showing a performance that wouldn't make you envy Jeremy Lukaku.

- 15 minutes left in the second half! The game that seemed to lean towards Inter's victory is now tied.

- That's why soccer is so exciting. Who would have thought Parma would catch up by the end of the first half? No one knew!

- Exactly.

"No!"

"It's that guy again!"

"Block him! Block him!"

"Please! Please!"

The screams of Inter's home fans filled San Siro.

In the early part of the game, they were clearly leading comfortably, but things completely changed in the second half, so they must be furious.

At the same time, they started to recall the Coppa Italia match from last season.

That game was honestly a nightmare.

Inter, which seemed capable of a double, was blocked by Parma and eliminated from the Coppa Italia.

"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, please die...!"

There are many devout believers in Italy.

Sometimes, people like that exist.

It's quite fascinating.

Well, people can't all be the same, right?

Look at Monica.

A typical Italian beauty who likes to stay at home and watch dramas.

Yet, she's a model by profession.

It's quite contradictory.

I didn't think the Monkey Wrench of Nazareth would come after me.

Honestly, wouldn't they be impressed?

That equalizing goal was so good that if I died and went to heaven, an angel would show me a highlight reel of my plays, and it would definitely be in it.

As Inter was shaken up,

Our coach, who was restless in the first half, returned to looking like a terminally ill patient with the genius coach syndrome.

It was a bit annoying to see him acting up again after he had started to become modest as his hairline receded.

"Damn."

Yeah, it's annoying.

So where should I vent this frustration?

Of course, on Inter, my opponent.

- The ball is connected to Minho again!

- Inter is in disarray! Minho, who was quiet in the first half, is now running wild like a mad horse in the second half!

- It's infuriating. He's so fast, has the dribbling style of a Brazilian player, and his kicks are too accurate to ignore.

When I started running,

All the Inter players shouted "Cazzo" and quickly pulled back the line.

I am omnipotent.

I can control the emotions of Inter's players.

After "Cazzo," "Vaffanculo" will come out.

What does "Vaffanculo" mean?

In Korean, it translates to something like this.

"Sh*t!"

Yeah, that's it.

It's similar to "Cazzo."

* * *

The young players on Parma's bench looked at Park Minho running across the field with admiration.

In the first half, Inter was an invincible team.

But Park Minho, who made it a tie in the second half, truly deserved the nickname "God of Parma."

"I want to assist Minho too."

"Am I really a backup for a player like that? Maybe I have hidden talent?"

"I want to play with Minho too."

Gennaro Tatis smiled at those players.

They would be the future of Parma.

The admiration they felt for Park Minho from watching today's game would greatly help their growth.

Seeing Kenneth miss the perfect pass from Park Minho and the players who screamed in disappointment, Gennaro spoke.

"What do you think? Would you have scored with that pass?"

At that question, the young players chirped excitedly like chicks.

"Of course! I would've scored with a fantastic scissor kick."

"I'm a center-back, so I might've headed it in..."

"I'm jealous of Kenneth."

Their eyes were full of envy for Kenneth, who was playing alongside Park Minho.

At the same time, they also had the hope that one day they could play on the field with Park Minho.

He single-handedly shook Inter's ironclad defense.

The defense that conceded the fewest goals to win the league in Serie A last season.

"If you want to play with Minho, work hard on your extra training. Minho has been doing an extra two hours of training every day after regular practice."

The young players nodded at those words.

But the players who experienced Park Minho since last season slightly shook their heads while watching the young ones.

'They'll be crying later.'

'Minho is a hard worker during training.'

'There's a reason Minho's stamina has gradually improved. These kids don't know it yet.'

The young players didn't know that no one except Santiago and Kenneth followed Park Minho's additional training.

"Wow! Minho got the ball again!"

At someone's shout,

The players on Parma's bench looked at the field.

They saw Park Minho dribbling past Inter's midfielder Stipe Brozovic.

* * *

- Minho! Dribbling past Stipe and advancing to the center.

- Parma is cautious this time. They are slowly passing the ball, looking for gaps in Inter's defense.

Dribbling the ball, I looked for space.

Stipe, whom I passed, followed like a mosquito, but there was no big problem in keeping the ball.

After connecting the ball to Santiago, who moved up to the high side, I slowly moved towards the half-space.

The ball was connected to Kenneth, who pushed into the final third.

Inter's Iosif Dvev cleared the ball with a typical Russian tough play.

Why did I see a young Inter fan praying in the distance?

Scanning around, I saw an old man pointing at me and shouting to break my legs.

There was a woman pulling her hair and crying.

On the other hand, Parma was... amazing.

From the 'vuvuzela villain' blowing a vuvuzela to Inter's cheering song to provoke the home fans,

The old man who drew Lautaro Marcius on his huge belly and knocked on it whenever Lautaro made a mistake,

And finally, the man in just his boxers dancing provocatively to annoy Inter fans.

That man was soon taken away by security.

Anyway, I could see all the fans' emotions clearly.

To be this emotional when it's still 2-2.

I really understood what soccer meant to Italians.

So, I need to score a goal for Parma fans.

Winning is much better than a draw, isn't it?

- 7 minutes left now.

- It's 'Minho Time,' which Parma fans have been waiting for. Minho has scored numerous decisive goals from the 35th minute of the second half to injury time since last season.

- Parma fans know. They know that Minho has scored incredible goals during this time!

- There's high expectation from Minho, who tends to score late in the game more than other players.

I can feel it slightly.

Inter's players are getting tired.

Of course, I'm also very tired.

It's true that Parma's players, who were dragged around defending in the first half, have also slowed down.

But the team holding the initiative until the end of the second half was us, not Inter.

Tap! Tap!

"Trying to break through again?"

Stipe Brozovic, who blocked my way, quietly muttered words that I couldn't tell if they were to himself or to me.

Of course, I'm thinking of breaking through.

As I started moving up slowly with the ball again, I saw our offensive line running with all their remaining energy.

Santiago was biting his teeth and pushing through the side.

Kenneth was constantly playing a cat-and-mouse game with Inter's defenders, looking for space to break through.

But Inter was more focused on me, raising their tension.

These sharp-minded guys.

They vaguely realized that I wouldn't link up but would push deep.

The most lethal, flamboyant, and unstoppable perfect attacking pattern in Parma.

An attack through me was beginning.

Of course, they had to be on high alert.

You think I'm boasting too much?

- Minhoooo! Breaks through! Look at Stipe Brozovic's expression! He looks like he has no idea how he got beaten!

If you show skills worthy of boasting, that's enough.

"Please stop!"

"Argh! Someone break that bastard's legs!"

"Pietro!"

Pietro Barella's tackle.

I subtly moved the ball to the side and went around.

Dennis Man, who caught the ball I moved, pushed into the center.

Of course, I went around to the side.

- Return to Minho! Parma! Breaking through the space allowed by Inter on the side!

- Goran Perisic! Be careful! The opponent is Minho! You have to block cautiously!

La Croqueta.

Messi's signature move.

With this move, he created many decisive moments.

He eventually became a player worthy of the nickname 'God of Soccer' and left his name in the history of world soccer.

- Minho! Minooooo!

- He broke through! Minho! He broke through!

I even had time to confirm Goran Perisic sliding on the field after being beaten by La Croqueta.

Thinking it was the last chance in the game, the surroundings became as clear as looking through a microscope.

A pass to Kenneth in the center.

And Kenneth, who stood like a pillar, blocked the view of the central defender Riccardo Castoni.

At the same time, I took the return pass and shot the type of shot I was best at from the half-space.

Yeah, a clean left-footed curler.

That fantastic shot, which is impossible to block even if you know it's coming, drew a beautiful trajectory and hit the net.

Thud!

A reversal goal in the 42nd minute of the second half.

Before confirming the net shaking, I, who was sure of the goal, quickly spread my arms and looked at the sky in front of the broadcast camera.

"Fantastica!"

"Fantastica!"

"Fantastica!"

It's ecstatic.

My second hat trick of the season.

And a hat trick in two consecutive games.

Parma fans chanted 'Fantastica' in joy at my amazing record since the start of the season.

Yeah, this is why I play soccer.

* * *

[Parma wins 3-2! Inter loses at home!]

[Parma! With Minho's consecutive hat tricks, they show a spectacular comeback against Inter!]

['Fantastica!' Parma away fans impressed by the dazzling play of the attacker from Korea!]

[Park Minho, who was smiling while losing! Proves the reason with a hat trick!]

[A fantastic Pele score, Park Minho's one-man show, Coach Gino Inzaghi's inscrutable smile, and an unexpected figure at the stadium.]

[Why did Arwen Wenger, former Arsenal coach turned football administrator, visit San Siro?]

[Arsenal! Did they send an SOS to Wenger for Minho's signing?]

[Coach Gino Inzaghi: 'Inter lost not to Parma, but to the fantastic star from Korea.']

[Park Minho, showing a shocking performance with 8 goals and 2 assists in just 4 league games!]

- Minooooooo!

- Inter is sh*t! Sh*t, I say!

- Aaaaah! We're first in the league! Parma is top of Serie A!

- It's still early in the season... but the atmosphere is so good! We might even lift at least one trophy from the league, Europa, or Coppa Italia!

It was an incredible victory.

Because one player, Park Minho, turned around a 2-0 deficit in the first half.

Naturally, Parma fans expressed their heated reactions and expectations with happiness.

But it was short-lived.

- Is that player... coming to our Arsenal?

- He could definitely be called the second Henry!

- Stupid Kroenke! Except for Lorenzo Lupo, every signing is sh*t! Really sh*t!

Suddenly, Arsenal fans barged in.

Following them, various global soccer fans came into Parma's community and caused a ruckus.

- Minho to Arsenal? He seems more suited to Inter?

- Tsk tsk... Dumb Arsenal guys... Seeing them cause a commotion even in the Italian community shows how low their level is?

- Minho is obviously for Real Madrid. Hala Madrid!

- Hala my a**. I feel the DNA of Barca in that player.

- Can you even come up with 52 million euros?

- If we sell Kleber Coutinho, we can get him!

- Who are you going to sell Coutinho to?

- Won't Man U buy him?

- Idiot.

A mess in Parma's community.

Parma fans were disgusted and chased away the various fandoms that invaded their community.

- Sh*t! You damn beasts!

- Where does Parma's god think he's going? He'll stay with us till the end of this season!

- Tsk tsk... Can't you wait for even a year? You don't deserve to welcome a god!

Leaving the noisy community behind, I entered the restaurant where a guest, who came with Leo, was waiting for me.

Inside a rather upscale restaurant.

An old man was sitting at a table near the window.

The old man stood up when he saw us.

It was 'him' whom we knew well.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Arwen Wenger."

Yes, it was that Arwen Wenger who made our Monica cry out, "Professor was a fairy... Please come back! Professor Wenger!"
