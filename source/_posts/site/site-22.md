## 9. Never Underestimate South Korea Again! (2)

South Korea.

A country that once had the fastest internet in the world.

Although it has lost its top spot due to the foolish actions of some companies, South Korea is still known as an internet powerhouse.

And.

In this internet powerhouse, countless Korean internet warriors have been born...

We call them 'keyboard warriors.'

Anyway.

The fan page of Lecce, which became the target of these Korean keyboard warriors, was in utter chaos.

[If Lecce continues like this...]

- Comment: Rider Kiiiiiiik!

[Does Lecce have any sense?]

- Comment: Not yet! This is just the beginning, lol.

[What's happening to our fan page?]

- Comment: I don't know. It looks like Korean. They suddenly came and started this.

└ You don't know? lol They started it first and now they are playing dumb, lol.

└ These Italian guys, seriously, lol.

[Tactician Tamura is ready.]

- Comment: You're all set?

└ You damn idiot! Ahhhh damn! I'm on your side! I'm on your side, you damn idiot!

And it wasn't just the fan page.

Lecce's ace player, Gabriel Strontech's SNS was flooded with all sorts of Korean curses, creating utter chaos.

On top of that, fans of Parma joined in, turning it into a complete mess.

Thanks to this, even before the game started, the looks from Lecce's home fans were anything but friendly.

"We might get shot at this rate."

"It's not that bad."

Even if Italians are known to be the most hot-tempered in Europe, they wouldn't think so extremely when it comes to football.

"Well... we might have to brace for some punches."

At Buffon's words, Santiago closed his mouth.

The opponent's starting lineup revealed before the match was indeed close to their best 11.

We also matched them with our best members.

We had been watching analysis videos of Lecce for a few days before the match, and it was clear that they were a team with much better strength than other Serie B teams.

Their organization was slightly better than S.P.A.L.

Their defensive capabilities were not at the Serie B level either.

Yet, the reason this team was in 5th place in the league was obviously due to their lack of scoring power.

"Phew..."

For some reason, I felt tired.

The game hadn't even started yet.

Seeing me like this, Santiago remarked, ‘Even Minho is nervous?’ but...

This wasn't nervousness; it was fatigue.

I don't know if it's because of the ongoing 'World War' on Lecce's fan page, but it was strangely bothering me.

So I sneaked in quietly.

[From now on, this is our Manchester United fan page!]

- Comment: (A picture of a frustrated-looking Man U player)

└ (A picture of a doomed beast)

└ (A picture of Wayne Rooney)

The top post on the fan page was a female character with cat ears and the Manchester United squad.

Just looking at this incomprehensible internet meme made me feel dizzy again.

Before entering the stadium.

I think I understood why the looks from Lecce's home fans were so sharp.

“Whatever.”

Still, what can be done?

I have to get ready for the match and prepare to step onto the field.

Yes, I'm a professional.

Even in this chaotic situation, if I show my skills properly, this issue will soon be buried.

In that deep, deep sea called the internet.

* * *

Booooo!

A tremendous amount of booing poured out.

Police were stationed between the away and home stands, separating the ultras of both teams with tense expressions.

Flutter!

And among the ultras of Parma, three young-looking Koreans were enthusiastically waving the Korean flag.

Seeing this, some Lecce fans hurled insults and raised their middle fingers.

The ultras of Parma were protecting these three Koreans and were shouting strange chants together.

(Deyan! Deyan Kulusevski of Parma!)

(Deyan! Deyan Kulusevski of Parma!)

(Deyan! Deyan Kulusevski of Parma!)

“Deyan?”

“Oh, Deyan? He’s the player who scored the winning goal that relegated Lecce to Serie B in the 19-20 season.”

“...”

“He’s now with Juventus... but he was on loan with our team two seasons ago.”

Such provocation.

If this match is this chaotic and rough, I wonder how much rougher the Istanbul derby or the Milan derby would be?

“The Milan derby isn’t that rough. Matches between Milan’s two clubs and Juventus are much rougher.”

At Buffon’s explanation, I naturally nodded.

(Fabio! Fabio! Fabio!)

(Thank you, Parma!)

(For taking that idiot Fabio!)

(For relegating with us to Serie B!)

(Fabio! Fabio! Fabio!)

This time, Lecce fans sang a strange chant using someone’s name to mock Parma.

Marlan, who was next to me, explained.

The name Fabio.

The owner of that name was the coach who relegated Parma in the 20-21 season.

Before that, he was also the coach who relegated Lecce to Serie B in the 19-20 season.

So, he’s a relegation specialist who relegated both teams.

A bit scary.

Parma didn’t like it either, so they loudly chanted Deyan’s name.

On the other hand, Lecce chanted Fabio’s name.

“They’re like kids.”

At Santiago’s words, Buffon chuckled.

It wasn’t entirely wrong.

“Anyway, you understand why we absolutely can’t lose today’s match, right? I can’t stand seeing those damn Lecce guys getting cocky.”

Everyone nodded at the words of our captain, Buffon.

It’s not a derby, but.

Since the opponent started the fight first.

I’m going to go all out too.

But.

Why am I so determined?

I got slightly pissed off seeing the opponent’s ace pass by without even shaking hands earlier.

I’m kind of a guy who holds grudges.

* * *

Beep!

As soon as the referee blew the whistle, the midfielders of both teams started what could be described as a fight.

Of course, they weren’t actually fighting.

It meant that the physical battles and tackles between the two teams were so rough that it looked almost like a derby match.

However, unfortunately, the side that took the initiative first was the home team, Lecce.

The booing from the extremely angry home fans.

And the home team that was well-prepared at home.

Honestly, the early part of the first half was inevitably unfavorable for us, and knowing this well, Coach Alain Laban instructed the players to drop back for about 20 minutes in the first half.

“Block it!”

“They’re coming up the flank again!”

Parma’s defense was under pressure.

Lecce’s attack was unusually sharp, and conversely, Parma’s defense was flustered by their momentum.

Lecce’s well-crafted attack patterns.

Their ace, Gabriel Strontech, was charging with the ball at a terrifying speed.

- He’s fast! Gabriel!

- The Brazilian winger is shaking Parma’s defense like crazy.

To block Gabriel, two of our midfielders cooperated but.

Gabriel, with his unique ball touch, slowly advanced while surveying the surroundings.

Then, he suddenly accelerated.

After stopping, he made a clean and beautiful pass between the two disorganized midfielders.

“High!”

“Hold your position!”

The slightly high pass curved enough to be called a cross and landed perfectly on the left foot of Lecce’s forward.

The Lecce forward, with his back to the goal, slowly pushed forward and managed to break through into the danger zone.

Waaaaaa!

The thunderous cheers of the home fans were heard.

Another pass to the flank.

Gabriel, who had moved deep, received the ball.

As he used his speed to break through.

A fatal mistake by Parma occurred.

Beep!

Yeeeess!

- Penalty! It’s a penalty!

- The referee pointed to the spot! And it’s a red card! Ah! Parma’s players are protesting.

- They’re saying it was a Hollywood action... but we need to look at VAR closely.

The referee had a brief conversation with the VAR assistant and then headed to check the VAR.

But it didn’t feel good.

It felt like the decision wouldn’t change.

Soon, the referee returned after watching VAR and upheld his decision.

Stanko appealed that it was a mistake.

That it was too harsh a judgment.

But the referee seemed to have decided that Stanko intentionally prevented a scoring chance, hence the red card.

Whether that tackle was a mistake or intentional.

Only Stanko would know.

His tackle was that rough and dirty.

In the end, Stanko Torric, who received the red card, left the field holding his head.

Yeeeess!

The cheers of the home fans grew louder.

A red card and a penalty kick in the 13th minute of the first half.

Gabriel Strontech quickly took the PK.

Thud!

- Goooooooal!

- Gabriel Strontech easily converts the PK, putting Lecce 1-0 ahead.

- Lecce, in a very advantageous position! This is an unwanted situation for Parma, happening just 13 minutes into the first half.

This is the worst.

A defender.

And a central defender at that, got sent off.

Coach Alain Laban, with a reddened face, quickly moved defensive midfielder Wylan Cyprien to the defender’s position.

We, being one man down, adjusted our formation to resemble a 3-4-2.

But Parma’s crisis wasn’t over yet.

The first half seemed to drag on endlessly.

Lecce’s second goal came.

A fantastic header in the 31st minute of the first half filled Lecce’s home stadium, Via del Mare, with cheers.

Waaaaaa!

Lecce! Lecce! Lecce! Lecce!

Now, trailing 2-0, the players’ expressions were much more grim than before.

Bang!

- Another shot hits the goalpost and goes over!

- Lecce’s relentless pressure continues!

- Parma is getting hit left and right!

How much time had passed?

Finally, the referee blew the whistle.

The first half was over.

The players sighed in relief.

Maybe because it was my first crisis since debuting as a professional, I felt oddly calm.

Isn’t it just a matter of scoring 3 goals and turning the game around?

* * *

Entering the locker room, Coach Alain Laban welcomed the players with a reddened face.

“Focus! Focus!”

He gathered the players’ attention.

He quickly explained how Parma should move in the second half.

“A 2-0 score is certainly a desperate number for us, being one man down. But positively thinking, we managed to limit their eleven shots on target to just 2 goals.”

“Lecce expended quite a bit of energy in the first half. Being the team with the 9th least activity in Serie B, they ran 3km more than us in the first half... they’re likely to drop back in the second half.”

Indeed.

Lecce isn’t a team with high activity.

On the other hand, Parma is the team with the highest activity in the league.

In individual records, the top 4 players with the most activity over 90 minutes are all Parma players.

1st is Yann Karamoh.

2nd is Dennis Man.

3rd is Franco Vázquez.

4th is Gennaro Tutino.

All four players cover about 14km, enjoying strong pressing in the second line.

Park Minho’s activity has also increased from 10km to 12km recently, showing considerable improvement.

“Our strength lies in our strong stamina and the organized forward pressing of our second line.”

“We conserved energy while sitting back in the first half, so in the second half, press hard to take control and score as much as possible.”

“Conceding goals? Don’t be afraid. Whether it’s 2-0, 3-0, or 5-0, a loss is a loss.”

Saying this, he comforted Stanko Torric, who had been sent off with a red card in the first half.

Thanks to Coach Alain Laban’s speech?

The tension disappeared from the players’ faces.

This time, our captain Buffon stepped up to rally the players and prepare for the second half.

Of course, Coach Alain Laban, despite his calm expression, was very flustered inside.

Only Assistant Coach Matteo knew that.

So halftime ended.

Parma’s players exited the locker room.

Their expressions were different from the first half.

* * *

Being one man short.

Parma’s players had to cover much more ground in the second half than Lecce to make up for the missing player.

But fortunately, Parma was a team with high stamina and a lot of activity.

They had enough ability to perplex the Lecce players, who entered the field with a light-hearted attitude.

- Parma looks different from the first half.

- It feels like we’re watching a completely different team, right?

- They’re moving a lot more.

It was the same for me.

My stamina had increased, and so had my activity.

Thanks to that, I was creating more chances and grabbing them to score more often.

So, even in this game where we were trailing 2-0, I was sure that if I moved diligently, I could create or seize several opportunities.

Just like now.

“Hey! Let’s take it easy.”

They had mocked us as T-shirt sellers, and now they wanted to go easy?

Honestly, if I had a worse personality, I might have cursed at their faces right away.

Well, I’m a professional.

I should show it with my skills.

Just like now.

As I caught my breath, the ball flew towards me.

The left-back of Lecce, who had been harassing me, quickly closed in to steal the ball.

But what did I say earlier?

I said my activity had increased.

Didn’t I?

Thump!

I pushed the ball far and ran, ignoring the left-back trying to catch up and dashed forward.

The gap widened instantly.

I could hear the left-back cursing.

He must be flustered.

Suddenly running like this.

But it’s not over yet.

- Minho! Minho! He quickly breaks through on the flank and then cuts inside, looking for a shooting angle!

- He’s fast! Two Lecce defenders are closing in!

I saw the two defenders moving quickly to block me.

Sorry, but I’m just a decoy.

I passed the ball forward and Santiago, who found the open space, took a clear shot.

Thud!

- Gooooooal!

- Santiago scores a magnificent goal!

- Parma catches up, 2-1! Just 6 minutes into the second half, they pull one back!

The Lecce defense was caught off guard by the quick goal.

They shouted at the midfielders, who had left the space open, to get their heads straight.

Santiago grabbed the ball from the net and approached the center line with a fist pump.

“Nice goal.”

“Nice pass.”

So I extended my hand for a handshake.

Santiago had a mysterious expression.

Why? Weren’t we going to play Rock-Paper-Scissors?

Now, the score is 2-1.

As we poured our energy into the second half and pressed the opponent hard, they couldn’t get their bearings.

Lecce, which had been so dominant in the first half, now pulled their line back.

Against just 10 men.

But even with their line back, they conceded the equalizing goal in the 21st minute of the second half.

- Gooooooal!

- Gennaro Tutino’s perfect header! Parma ties the score in the 21st minute of the second half!

- Amazing! Parma!

Boooooo!

The Lecce home fans, who had been cheering and mocking in the first half, were now booing and cursing.

About 25 minutes left.

And the score is 2-2.

Parma had plenty of time and opportunity to turn the game around.

And I still had some energy left to run wild.

Suddenly, an amazing goal by a player I knew well came to mind.

If I replicate that, it would be killer.

Turning my head slightly, I saw the fluttering Korean flag.

“Did Senior Shin Joon-seo dribble for 80 meters?”

For the three Koreans who followed us to this away game.

Shall I fill them with some national pride?
