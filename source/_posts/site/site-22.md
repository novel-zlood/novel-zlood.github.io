## 9. Never Underestimate South Korea Again! (2)

Korea.

A country that once had the fastest internet in the world.

Although it has lost its position as the world leader in average internet speed due to some foolish actions by a few companies,

Korea is still known as an internet powerhouse.

And,

In this internet powerhouse, numerous Korean internet warriors are born...

We call them 'keyboard warriors.'

Anyway,

The Lecce fan page targeted by these Korean keyboard warriors was in utter chaos.

[If Lecce continues like this...]

- Comment: Rider Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!

[Lecce idiots can't get their act together?]

- Comment: Not yet! That's what I'm saying! LOL

[What's happening on our fan page right now?]

- Comment: I don't know. It looks like Korean, but they suddenly came and started this.

└ You don't know? LOL They started it first and now play dumb LOL

└ Seriously, these Italian idiots LOL

[Tactical Weapon Tamura loaded.]

- Comment: Are you stocked up?

└ You son of a b****! Ugh! F***! I'm on your side! I'm on your side, you son of a b****!

It wasn't just the fan page.

Lecce's ace,

Gabriel Strontezza's SNS was flooded with all sorts of Korean curses, turning it into pure chaos.

Additionally, with Parma fans joining in, it became a complete mess.

Because of this, even before the game started,

The looks from Lecce's home fans were quite intense.

"We might get shot at this rate."

"It's not that bad."

No matter how hot-tempered Italians are known to be in Europe,

They wouldn't think so extremely about football.

"Well... we should at least be prepared for some fistfights."

At Buffon's words, Santiago shut his mouth tightly.

The opponent's starting lineup revealed before the match was close to their best 11.

We also matched them with our best members.

We had been watching their analysis videos for a few days before the Lecce match, and it was clear that they were a much stronger team than other Serie B teams.

They were slightly more organized than S.P.A.L.

Their defense was above Serie B level.

The reason this team is in 5th place in the league is obviously due to their poor scoring ability.

"Hoo..."

I felt strangely tired.

The game hasn't even started yet.

Santiago looked at me curiously, thinking, 'Is Minho also nervous?' but

This wasn't nervousness, it was exhaustion.

I was oddly bothered, perhaps because the 'World War' was still ongoing on the Lecce fan page.

So, I sneaked in to take a look.

[From now on, this is our Manchester United fan page!]

- Comment: (A picture of a pissed-off Man U fan)

└ (A picture of a doomed beast)

└ (A picture of Wayne Rooney)

At the top of the fan page was a female character with strange cat ears and the Manchester United squad.

Just looking at this incomprehensible internet meme made me feel dizzy again.

Before entering the stadium,

I understood why the looks from the Lecce home fans were so sharp.

"Smack."

But what can I do?

I have to prepare for the game and get ready to enter the field.

Right, I'm a pro.

Even in this chaotic situation, if I just show my skills properly, this issue will soon be buried.

Deep, deep in the sea of the internet.

* * *

Booooo!

A tremendous amount of booing was pouring in.

Police were stationed between the away and home stands, nervously separating the two teams' ultras.

Flap!

And among Parma's ultras, three young-looking Koreans were enthusiastically waving the Korean flag.

Seeing this, some Lecce fans were swearing and showing the middle finger.

Parma's ultras were protecting these three Koreans, shouting insults and strange chants together.

(Dejan! Dejan Kulusevski of Parma!)

(Dejan! Dejan Kulusevski of Parma!)

(Dejan! Dejan Kulusevski of Parma!)

"Dejan?"

"Oh, Dejan? He was our player who scored the decisive goal that relegated Lecce to Serie B in the 2019-20 season."

"..."

"He's with Juventus now, but he played for our team on loan two seasons ago."

What a provocation.

If a non-derby match is this chaotic and rough, how much rougher would the Istanbul or Milan derbies be?

"The Milan derby isn't that rough. Matches between the two Milan clubs and Juventus are much rougher."

I nodded at Buffon's explanation.

(Fabio! Fabio! Fabio!)

(Thank you, Parma!)

(For taking the stupid Fabio!)

(And getting relegated to Serie B with us!)

(Fabio! Fabio! Fabio!)

This time, Lecce's fans were using someone's name in a strange chant to mock Parma.

Marjan, who was next to me, explained.

The name Fabio.

He told me that Fabio was the coach who relegated Parma in the 2020-21 season and had previously relegated Lecce to Serie B in the 2019-20 season.

So, he's an expert in relegation, huh?

A bit scary.

Parma didn't like that part either, so they loudly chanted the name of player Dejan.

Conversely, Lecce chanted the name of coach Fabio.

"They're like kids."

Santiago's words made Buffon chuckle.

He wasn't entirely wrong.

"Anyway, you understand why we absolutely can't lose today's match, right? I can't stand the thought of these damn Lecce fans getting even more arrogant."

Everyone nodded at the captain Buffon's words.

It's not a derby, but

Since the opponent picked a fight first,

I might as well go all out.

But,

Why am I so determined?

I got slightly annoyed when I saw their ace pass by without shaking hands earlier.

I'm originally a bit petty.

* * *

Beep!

As soon as the referee blew the whistle, the midfielders of both teams practically started a fight.

Of course, they weren't actually fighting.

It meant that the physical battles and tackles between the two teams were as intense as a derby match.

But unfortunately, the side that took the initiative first was the home team, Lecce.

The boos from the highly agitated home fans.

And the home team, well-prepared on their home ground.

Honestly, the early first half was bound to be disadvantageous for us, and coach Alain Levagne instructed the players to drop back around the 20th minute of the first half.

"Block it!"

"They're coming up the flanks again!"

Parma's defense had no time to relax.

Lecce's attackers were sharper than usual, and Parma's defense was flustered and struggling under the onslaught.

Lecce's well-executed attacking patterns.

Gabriel Strontezza, the ace, was sprinting with the ball at an insane speed.

- He's fast! Gabriel!

- The Brazilian winger is wreaking havoc in Parma's territory.

Two of our midfielders had no choice but to double up on Gabriel to stop him.

Gabriel, with his unique ball touch, slowly advanced while scanning the surroundings.

Then, with a sudden burst of speed,

He stopped and threaded a clean, beautiful pass between the two disrupted midfielders.

"High!"

"Hold your positions!"

The slightly high pass curved enough to be considered a cross and landed perfectly at Lecce's forward's left foot.

The Lecce forward, holding the ball with his back to the goal, slowly pushed his way into a dangerous area.

Waaaaaaaah!

The thunderous cheers of the home fans echoed.

Another pass to the flank.

Gabriel, who had penetrated deep, received the ball.

As he used his speed to break through,

A critical mistake from Parma followed.

Beep!

Yeeeeeeeeeeees!

- Penalty! It's a penalty!

- The referee has pointed to the spot! And it's a red card! Oh! The Parma players are protesting.

- They seem to be claiming it's a dive... We need to look at the VAR closely.

The referee had a brief conversation with the VAR assistant and then headed to review the VAR.

But it didn't feel good.

It felt like the decision wouldn't be overturned.

Soon, the referee reviewed the VAR and continued with the decision.

Stanko appealed that it was a mistake.

He claimed it was too harsh a call.

But the referee seemed to have judged that Stanko deliberately prevented a scoring chance, thus giving a red card.

Only Stanko would know if that tackle was a mistake or intentional.

Stanko's tackle was rough and dirty enough.

In the end, Stanko Toric, who received a red card, held his head and left the field.

Yeeeeeeeeeeees!

The cheers of the home fans grew louder.

A red card and a penalty kick in the 13th minute of the first half.

Gabriel Strontezza quickly took the PK.

Thump!

- Gooooooal!

- Gabriel Strontezza easily converts the PK, putting Lecce ahead 1-0.

- Lecce has secured a significant advantage! An unwanted situation for Parma came just 13 minutes into the first half.

This is the worst.

A defender.

And the central defender at that, got sent off.

Coach Alain Levagne urgently moved defensive midfielder Wylan Cyprien to the defender position, and his face was visibly red.

We had to adjust to a 3-4-2 formation due to being one man down.

But Parma's crisis was not over yet.

The first half seemed to drag on.

Lecce scored their second goal.

In the 31st minute of the first half, a fantastic header colored Lecce's home ground, Via del Mare, with cheers.

Waaaaaah!

Lecce! Lecce! Lecce! Lecce!

Now trailing 2-0, the players' expressions were much more serious.

Dang!

- Another shot hits the goalpost and goes out!

- Lecce continues to apply intense pressure!

- Parma is just taking a beating!

How much time had passed?

Finally, the referee blew the whistle.

The first half was over.

The players sighed with relief.

Maybe because it was my first crisis since debuting as a pro, I felt strangely calm.

Can't we just score three goals and turn it around?

* * *

Entering the locker room, coach Alain Levagne greeted the players with a red face.

"Focus! Focus!"

He gathered the players' attention.

He quickly explained how Parma should move in the second half.

"A 2-0 score is certainly a desperate number for us, being one man down. But thinking positively, we can say we held off 11 shots on target from the opponent to just 2 goals."

"Lecce spent quite a bit of energy in the first half. The team with the ninth-lowest activity in Serie B ran 3 km more than us in the first half... They are likely to drop back in the second half."

Indeed.

Lecce isn't a highly active team.

But on the other hand, Parma is the team with the highest activity in the league.

In individual records, the top four players in terms of activity over 90 minutes all belong to Parma.

1st is Yann Karamoh.

2nd is Dennis Man.

3rd is Franco Vazquez.

4th is Gennaro Tutino.

All four players cover around 14 km, enjoying strong pressing in the second line.

Park Minho has also recently increased his activity from 10 km to 12 km, seeing quite a bit of success.

"Our strength is our strong stamina and the organized forward pressing of the second line."

"We saved our energy while crouching in the first half, so start pressing hard in the second half to take control and score as many goals as possible."

"Conceding? Don't be afraid. Whether it's 2-0, 3-0, or 5-0, it's the same loss."

After saying that, he comforted Stanko Toric, who was sent off with a red card in the first half.

Was it thanks to coach Alain Levagne's speech?

The tension disappeared from the players' faces.

This time, captain Buffon stepped up to gather the players' morale and prepare for the second half.

Of course, coach Alain Levagne, who had a calm expression, was very flustered inside.

Only assistant coach Matteo knew that.

With that, halftime ended.

Parma's players left the locker room.

Their expressions were different from the first half.

* * *

Being one man short,

Parma's players had to cover the field much more than Lecce in the second half to fill the gap.

But fortunately, Parma was a team with high stamina and activity.

They had enough ability to bewilder Lecce, who entered the field with a carefree attitude.

- It's a different Parma compared to the first half.

- It feels like we're watching a completely different team, right?

- They're moving a lot more.

That included me as well.

My stamina had also increased significantly, and my activity had risen.

Thanks to that, I was able to create more chances or capitalize on them to score.

So even in this game where we were trailing 2-0, I was confident that if I moved diligently, I could create or seize a few opportunities.

Like now.

"Hey! Take it easy."

They mocked us as T-shirt sellers, and now they want us to take it easy.

Honestly, if I had a worse personality, I might have cursed at that face right away.

Well, I'm a pro.

I have to let my skills speak.

Like now.

As I caught my breath, the ball flew in.

The Lecce left-back who had been pestering me quickly came next to me, trying to steal the ball.

But what did I say earlier?

I said my activity had increased compared to before.

Didn't I say that?

Thunk!

When I pushed the ball far and ran, I ignored the fullback who hurriedly tried to catch up and sprinted forward.

The gap widened quickly.

I heard the Lecce fullback cursing.

He must be flustered.

Because I suddenly sprinted like this.

But it's not over yet.

- Minho! Minho! He quickly breaks through the flank and cuts into the center, looking for a shooting angle!

- He's fast! Two Lecce defenders are closing in!

I saw the two defenders moving quickly to block my path.

Sorry, but I'm just a decoy.

As I sent the ball far forward, Santiago, who found the open space, took a clean shot.

Thump!

- Gooooooal!

- Santiago's clean shot hits the net!

- Parma pulls one back in the 6th minute of the second half!

The suddenly conceded goal.

The Lecce defense was visibly flustered.

At the same time, I heard them shouting at their midfielders to wake up.

Santiago grabbed the ball from the net and brought it to the center line, raising his fist.

"Nice goal."

"Nice pass."

So I held out my fist.

Santiago made a puzzled expression.

What? Weren't we supposed to play rock-paper-scissors?

Alright, the score is now 2-1.

By pouring our stamina into the second half and pressing them hard, Lecce couldn't regain their composure.

Despite dropping their line, Lecce conceded an equalizer in the 21st minute of the second half.

- Gooooooal!

- Gennaro Tutino's perfect header! Parma finally equalizes in the 21st minute of the second half!

- Amazing! Parma!

Boooooo!

The Lecce home fans, who had been jeering and cheering in the first half, were now booing and cursing.

About 25 minutes left.

And the score is 2-2.

Parma had enough time and opportunity to turn the game around.

And I still had some energy left to run wild.

Suddenly, an incredible goal from a player I know well popped into my head.

If I mimic that, it would be awesome.

I glanced at the fluttering Korean flag.

"Did Sun Joon-seo sunbae say he dribbled 80 meters?"

For the three Koreans who followed us to the away game.

Shall I give them a dose of national pride?
