## 4. Pro Debut (2)

The impact of the friendly match.

And the story of an ordinary spectator becoming a professional and showing outstanding performance.

Maybe it's because these two factors were mixed together?

Even after a few days, the media spotlight on me was not easily fading away.

Well... It would be surprising.

A 24-year-old late bloomer rookie.

Coming from a small country called Korea, argued with the coach while watching the game (the media thinks so), and then proved my skills on the field to become a professional—this is me.

Even from an objective standpoint, it was inevitable that people would be interested.

I heard that my uniform was selling quite well.

It wasn’t just the media in Parma making noise.

There was a big commotion in Korea as well.

I heard that in the soccer communities, my story was spreading with the title, "A spectator frustratedly stormed the field.jpg."

Recently, my story was introduced quite prominently in the sports section of portal sites.

Anyway.

An ordinary person might easily get caught up in this atmosphere and develop a star complex.

Unfortunately, I’m too much of a coward to get such a star complex.

I constantly doubt my talent and performance.

Just focusing on training more than anyone else.

Recently, seeing me like this, Santiago also seemed to get competitive, training harder.

This is good news.

Thanks to that, Santiago, who had gained a lot of weight, was gradually recovering his old form.

The team was running smoothly, except for when Coach Alain Levagne would watch Santiago training and mumble, “Even Santiago has changed. Indeed, I must be a great coach.”

"Amazing."

Gianluca admired me.

Why does he think it's amazing?

Honestly, it’s natural for a soccer player to focus on training.

When I said that, Gianluca chuckled and shook his head.

“Really... You're a guy I can’t figure out.”

Then he moved away with a shrug.

This time, Santiago approached.

Hesitantly.

This South American sausage definitely seemed to get mentally tougher as he lost weight.

"Uh... Sorry about last time."

“Don’t worry about it.”

"Uh... okay."

Santiago awkwardly apologized and then backed away, but kept looking at me intensely.

When he kept doing that during the entire training, I felt uneasy and asked.

“Why? Do you have something to ask?”

“No, just…”

Santiago scratched his head awkwardly and finally approached me to ask.

“I have something to ask…”

“What is it?”

“Do you like beef?”

Beef...

I would eat it if I had it.

* * *

Human relationships can be torn apart by trivial things.

And they can also get closer through other trivial things.

In that sense, Santiago’s dinner invitation hinted that our relationship had changed significantly.

Giovanni Buffon, Gianluca.

Simon Sof, and Gennaro Tatis.

Lastly, even Marian Kurtić, the team's central midfielder, was invited to this dinner gathering, and I was included as well.

Santiago turned out to be a good guy, contrary to his earlier racist remarks.

Maybe he said those things because he was too naive.

I thought that might be the case.

In Korea, beef is too expensive to taste.

This Argentine friend showed his love for Argentine beef lavishly.

Starting with asado, various meat dishes were served, and everyone enjoyed except for a few veterans.

Giovanni Buffon and Marian Kurtić, being older, were quite selective about what they ate.

Maybe that’s why they have such long careers?

However, Gianluca ate heartily.

Even though he was also a veteran, his mindset was different.

Anyway.

Thanks to this dinner invitation, Santiago and I were able to get quite close.

And the effect was evident in the last friendly match before the first round of the Italian Cup.

-Gooooooal!

-Wowwwwwwwwww!

With Santiago on the wing and me playing as a central striker instead of an attacking midfielder, we achieved a 6-0 victory against Antalyaspor from the Turkish league.

Coach Alain Levagne was delighted, saying that my use as a striker and Santiago’s use on the wing were more destructive than he had thought.

Especially, the synergy between Santiago and me was significant.

Yeah, like the combination of Ronaldo and Benzema from the past Real Madrid.

I moved like Benzema.

And Santiago looked like the real Ronaldo.

He scored 4 goals alone.

I recorded 3 assists.

Coach Alain Levagne looked at me with sparkling eyes.

I guess I’ll be playing on the wing later, too?

Anyway.

The team’s atmosphere reached its peak.

Even without Franco, the offense was averaging 3 goals per game.

Of course, it was a friendly match.

But even in a friendly match, averaging 3 goals per game is not easy.

Therefore, the attention of Parma’s staff and fans was on the first round of the Italian Cup.

Moreover, my prominent performance was increasingly gaining attention in Korea.

A few days ago, a reporter from Korea even came to visit.

What could have been a nuisance, Giovanni quickly handled by signing autographs and repeatedly saying, "Hankook! Kimchi! VTS! Love you," and shooing the reporters away.

That seemed like experience.

So.

My pro debut was approaching.

The coach had already told me.

To prepare well because I would definitely start in the first round of the Italian Cup.

And August 15th arrived.

The day of destiny.

* * *

Time passed faster than I thought after joining the club.

The preseason was over.

The first round of the Italian Cup had arrived.

I adapted to the team faster than I thought.

It helped that the players of Parma had easy-going personalities, but honestly, I think half of it was because I showed my skills.

Oh, of course, I’m still a newbie.

Santiago said, “In the club, the one who plays well is the king,” so I just tried saying it once.

Parma Calcio’s home stadium.

‘Stadio Ennio Tardini.’

Locals mostly call it ‘Tardini.’

It’s relatively small and can only hold about 22,000 people, but I didn’t think it was any less passionate than other big clubs.

The fans were so passionate that some ultras who set off flares last time were banned from the stadium for 3 years.

Apart from that, Parma’s fans are definitely good fans who love soccer and love the club.

Waaaaaaah!

With the fans' cheers, the anthem ‘Forza Parma’ began to resonate.

When I first heard it on MyTube, I thought the melody was childish and old-fashioned.

But hearing it sung by fans in the stadium made my heart naturally swell.

Wearing my uniform, now fixed with number 24 after going through several numbers, I sat down and listened to the anthem.

(Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!)

(Son Crociati e tutti campioni!)

(Son del Parma i prodi calciatori!)

“It’s the first match of the season. Of course, it’s a cup match, so it’s not as important as the league.”

Coach Alain Levagne stood in front of the players.

Our coach is really amazing.

He speaks French, Italian, and English so well that he doesn’t need an interpreter.

“I won’t tell you to play for me. But play for the fans. Play for your career. Got it?”

Thanks to that, his message was properly conveyed to the whole team.

“We enter in one minute.”

Hearing the club official’s words, Giovanni Buffon nodded and stood up, drawing the players' attention.

“Italian Cup. It’s definitely a cup competition that’s less important than the league.”

“But no matter how unimportant it is, the fans who came to see this game don’t give a damn about that.”

“Fans want victory. Even if we’re up against an 8-year-old team. So. Let’s win. Let’s give victory to the Gialloblu who came to see us today. Let’s go!”

“Let’s go!”

“Let’s give it our all!”

It was a simple and calm speech.

But it seemed that we could look at this game calmly.

I followed the players out of the locker room.

Finally, I’m playing my pro debut match.

* * *

-The first round of the Italian Cup! The match between Parma Calcio and Ternana is about to begin.

-Both teams are in Serie B. Parma was relegated from Serie A last year after finishing 20th. On the other hand, Ternana was promoted from Serie C and joined Serie B this time.

-A match between a relegated team and a promoted team. I’m really curious to see who will be the winner today.

-Not only that... but it’s also the debut match of a player with an interesting backstory, right?

-Hahaha! You mean the incident where a spectator, who was giving advice while watching the game, stormed the field?

-Yes, that spectator is now entering the field as a Parma player.

There were many interesting elements in this match.

The element of a match between a team relegated from Serie A and a team promoted from Serie C was quite intriguing.

And the debut match of the protagonist of the incident where a spectator stormed the field and scored a goal in a friendly match was also enough to pique interest.

-Park Minho! He is the protagonist of that incident. Let’s see what kind of performance he will show in Parma. And can he make it in the pros?

-I’m curious. Really curious.

There was a lot of attention.

Parma home fans looked at Park Minho with curiosity.

Could that player show his true skills in an official match, not just a friendly?

Ternana was set to take the first kick.

The referee brought the whistle to his lips.

Beeeeep!

With the sound signaling the start of the match, the players of both teams began to move according to their tactics.

Ternana took the initiative in the early stages.

They made it difficult for Parma’s players to advance with the ball, with their excellent activity and strong pressure.

“They’re going all out from the start.”

Coach Alain Levagne frowned.

Parma’s strength lay in their excellent attack development using their solid second line.

Thanks to that, Parma left a strong impression in friendly matches, scoring more than 3 goals in every game.

But if there’s a clear strength, there’s also a weakness.

Parma’s weakness was, of course, their defense.

The midfielders in the third line tried to protect the defense and break through the pressure.

But Ternana seemed to read Parma’s thoughts and dug into the center from the start.

Much stronger pressure than expected left Parma's players flustered.

Naturally, when psychological pressure was added, mistakes came from Parma's defense.

And because of that fatal mistake, Parma had to struggle from the beginning of the match.

Thud!

-Gooooooal!

-Ternana! Scores the opening goal within 7 minutes of the first half!

-It was a quick pass exchange in the center that led to a perfect killer pass behind the defense!

Ternana justified their early expenditure of energy by getting a result.

The score was 1-0.

The expressions of Parma's players stiffened.

* * *

Santiago and Dennis Man, who were playing on the wings today, had their expressions hardened as well.

It was a mistake by the central defender, Elias Kobot.

A player with great activity and good team play.

But his poor judgment and lack of ball skills held the team back this time.

At the same time, the tension that had built up in my shoulders due to my debut melted away, and my vision felt wider.

“Indeed, it feels different from a friendly match.”

Maybe I was a bit nervous.

I’m still a newbie and a coward.

When I turned my head, I saw Giovanni comforting the defenders.

Yeah, it’s only one goal.

The first half was only 7 minutes in.

The momentum had shifted to the opponent.

But if we could break their rhythm here?

The situation was such that Ternana, who had exhausted their energy from the start, could easily collapse.

Besides, Ternana was not Liverpool.

Unlike Klopp’s Liverpool seen on TV, their pressure was not perfect.

There were gaps.

The Ternana defenders, who had been looking at me like some curious animal before the match, were full of confidence.

I wanted to exploit those gaps and mess up those defenders' faces.

Since the third line was a mess, it was going to be a bit of a struggle.

The opponent took a gamble and succeeded by expending energy.

I decided to overextend myself a bit to show them.

To show them what kind of player I am.

-Number 24, Minho! He’s coming down quite deep to receive the ball. It seems like he’s trying to relieve the pressure on the third line himself.

-A player who leads the team’s attack should occasionally show this kind of play.

When I received the ball and moved around the halfway line, the passes flowed much more smoothly than before.

The movements of the midfielders in the third line looked much more comfortable.

But it wasn’t as easy as I thought to make a pass forward from this position.

Time continued to pass.

Around the 20th minute of the first half?

The opponent’s pressure slightly weakened.

Yeah, even Liverpool doesn’t press for the full 90 minutes.

“Catch this!”

I connected the ball to Marian Kurtić and quickly scanned the surroundings, spotting a rough space.

“Santiago.”

Santiago was in a good position.

The ball came back to me.

I quickly passed it to Santiago.

At the same time, I sprinted forward.

-A slightly long pass?

-It seems like a pass miss.

A slightly long pass.

Everyone’s eyes were filled with questions as they watched the ball head toward an ambiguous area.

But Santiago was different.

He looked into my eyes and then, with a confident expression, sprinted in the direction the ball was rolling.

So fast that the Ternana defender, who was a bit complacent, was flustered.

-Oh! He’s fast! Santiago! Santiago! He got the ball! He broke through the left wing in an instant!

-He’s running! He’s fast! He’s fast!

Santiago, who had cleanly broken through the left side, turned his head to check the position of our attacking players.

Gennaro Tatis, positioned in the center, was a stretch.

Dennis Man, on the opposite side, was driving the defender and moving into the center.

With Santiago’s poor passing ability, it was impossible to pass to Dennis Man on the opposite side.

Eventually, Santiago turned his head to the center and made eye contact with me, who had comfortably positioned myself between the defenders.

Thud!

The long pass luckily landed at my feet.

It felt slightly long, but it was within a range I could control.

One of the opponents tried to stick to me.

But my eyes were already focused on the gap in Ternana’s defense.

And soon, my left foot swiftly swung.

-Oh? Minho! A direct shot!

-Oh! Oh! Goooooooal! Goal!

-Minho! A fantastic curling shot! He succeeded with a sensational shot through the slight gap between Ternana's defenders!

-Amazing! Amazing!

The Ternana defenders stared at me blankly.

An equalizing goal scored at the 21st minute of the first half.

Immediately after scoring, I ran towards the stands.

Sssshhh!

Sliding on my knees and clenching my fist, I heard the cheers of Parma’s fans looking at me.

“Minho! Minho! Minho!”

“Wow! This is it! This is it!”

“Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho!”

Feeling their intense passion, I shouted.

“Who am I!!!”

In response to my question, some home fans nearby shouted.

“Park-Minhooooooooo!”

Hearing that cheer, I thought.

This might get addictive.
