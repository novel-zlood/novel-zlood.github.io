## 4. Pro Debut (2)

**The Impact of the Friendly Match**

And the story of an ordinary spectator becoming a professional and showcasing outstanding performance.

Could it be because of these two factors combined?

Even after a few days had passed, the media spotlight on me had not easily faded.

Well, it would be surprising.

A late bloomer rookie at 24 years old.

Coming from a small country like Korea, arguing with the coach while watching a game (that's how the media knows it), proving myself on the field, and then becoming a professionalâ€”it was an iconic story.

Even from an objective standpoint, it was a situation that naturally drew interest.

I heard my uniform was selling quite well.

It wasn't just noisy within the media in Parma.

There was an uproar in Korea as well.

I heard that on football-related communities, my story was spreading with the title 'Spectator who got frustrated and stormed onto the field.jpg'.

Recently, my story was also prominently featured in the sports section of portal sites due to my performance.

Anyway.

If I were an ordinary person, it would be easy to catch a case of celebrity syndrome in this atmosphere.

Unfortunately, I'm too much of a coward to catch such a syndrome.

Constantly doubting my talent and performance.

I just focus on training more than anyone else.

Recently, seeing me like that, Santiago also seemed to develop a competitive spirit and was training harder.

This was good news.

Thanks to that, Santiago, who had put on quite a bit of weight, was gradually recovering his past form.

Except for the times when Coach Alain Lavin would look at Santiago training and mutter, "Even Santiago has changed. Maybe I really am a great coach?" the team was running smoothly.

"Impressive."

Gianluca, admiring me.

Why does he say it's impressive?

Honestly, for a football player, focusing on training is a given.

When I said something along those lines, Gianluca smiled and shook his head.

"Really... You're a hard one to figure out."

Then he casually moved to another spot.

This time, Santiago approached.

Awkwardly.

This South American sausage definitely showed that losing weight also sharpened his mind.

"Um... Sorry about last time."

"Don't worry about it."

"Uh... Okay."

After awkwardly apologizing, Santiago slipped behind me, staring at me intently.

He kept doing that throughout the training, so I asked because it was bothering me.

"Why? Do you have something to ask?"

"No, just..."

Santiago scratched his head awkwardly and avoided eye contact, then finally came up to me and asked.

"I have something to ask..."

"What is it?"

"Do you like beef?"

Beef...

Can't eat because I don't have any.

* * *

Relationships between people can be torn apart by trivial things.

And they can also become closer through other trivial things.

In that sense, Santiago's dinner invitation suggested that our relationship had changed significantly.

Giovanni Buffon, Gianluca.

Simon Sop, and Gennaro Tatis.

Lastly, Marian Kurtic, the central midfielder of the team, was also invited to this dinner gathering, and I was included as well.

Santiago turned out to be a good guy.

Considering the racial slurs and other discriminatory remarks he had made, he was quite innocent.

Maybe he said such things because his mind was too pure.

I also thought that.

In Korea, beef is too expensive to taste.

This Argentinian friend showed a grand love for Argentinian beef.

Starting with asado, various meat dishes were served, and everyone except a few veterans enjoyed it enthusiastically.

Giovanni Buffon and Marian Kurtic, due to their age, were quite selective about what they ate.

Maybe that's the reason they have such long careers?

However, Gianluca ate heartily.

Even though they are both veterans, their mindsets are different.

Anyway.

Thanks to this dinner invitation, Santiago and I got quite close.

And that connection showed its effect in the last friendly match before the first round of the Coppa Italia.

- Gooooooal!

- Wooooooow!

With Santiago playing on the flank and me, not as an attacking midfielder but as a central forward, we achieved a 6-0 victory against Antalyaspor from the Turkish league.

Coach Alain Lavin was delighted, saying the combination of me as a forward and Santiago on the flank was more destructive than expected.

Especially the synergy between Santiago and me was significant.

Like the combination of Ronaldo and Benzema in the past for Real Madrid.

I moved like Benzema.

Santiago actually looked like Ronaldo.

He scored 4 goals alone.

I recorded 3 assists.

Coach Alain Lavin looked at me with sparkling eyes.

Looks like I'll be playing on the flank later on?

Anyway.

The team's atmosphere was at its peak.

Even without Franco, the attacking team averaged 3 goals per match.

Of course, it was a friendly match.

But no matter how friendly the match was, consistently scoring an average of 3 goals per game is not an easy task.

That's why the eyes of Parma's staff and fans were fixed on the first round of the Coppa Italia.

Moreover, my outstanding performance was increasingly drawing attention from Korea as well.

A few days ago, a journalist from Korea even came to visit.

Giovanni subtly gave an autograph and repeatedly said, "Korea! Kimchi! VTS! Love you!" to quickly fend off the journalists.

This seemed to be the experience showing.

And so.

My professional debut was approaching.

The coach had already told me.

To prepare well because I would definitely be starting in the first round of the Coppa Italia.

And August 15th approached.

The day of destiny, that is.

* * *

Time passed faster than expected after joining the club.

The pre-season was over.

The first round of the Coppa Italia had arrived.

I adapted to the team faster than expected.

It was partly because the personalities of the Parma players were easygoing, but honestly, I think half of it was because I showcased my skills.

Ah, of course, I'm still a 'nobody'.

Santiago said, "The best player in the club is the king," so I just tried saying it once.

Parma Calcio's home stadium.

'Stadio Ennio Tardini'.

The locals mostly call it 'Tardini'.

It's a bit small and can only hold about 22,000 people, but I didn't think it was any less passionate compared to other big clubs.

The fans were so passionate that some ultras were banned from entering the stadium for 3 years because they set off flares last time.

Excluding such parts, Parma fans are definitely good fans who love football and the club.

Wooooow!

With the cheers of the fans, the support song 'Forza Parma' started to echo.

When I first heard it on YouTube, I thought the melody was cheesy and old-fashioned.

But hearing it sung by the fans in the stadium made my heart naturally swell.

Wearing my uniform, which had gone through various numbers before settling on 24, I sat down and listened to the support song.

(Parma! Parma! Parma! Parma!)

(Son Crociati e tutti campioni!)

(Son del Parma i prodi calciatori!)

"It's the first game of the season. Of course, because it's a cup competition, it's honestly less important than the league."

Coach Alain Lavin stood before the players.

Our coach is really amazing.

He's so good at languages that he doesn't even need an interpreter for French, Italian, and English.

"I won't tell you to play for me. But play for the fans. Play for your career. Got it?"

Thanks to that, his message was properly conveyed to the entire team.

"We enter in one minute."

Hearing the club official's words, Giovanni Buffon nodded and stood up, gathering the players' attention.

"The Coppa Italia. Sure, it's a cup competition that's less important than the league."

"But no matter how less important it is, the fans who came to watch this game don't give a damn about that."

"The fans want a victory. Even if we're playing against a team of 8-year-olds. So. Let's win. Let's give a victory to the Gialloblu who came to see us today. Let's go!"

"Let's go!"

"Let's do well!"

It was a clean and calm speech.

But it seemed to make us look at this game calmly.

I followed the players out of the locker room.

Finally, I was about to play my professional debut.

* * *

- The first round of the Coppa Italia! The match between Parma Calcio and Ternana is about to begin.

- Both teams are in Serie B. Parma was relegated from Serie A last year, finishing 20th. On the other hand, Ternana was promoted from Serie C and joined Serie B this time.

- A match between a relegated team and a promoted team. I'm really curious to see who will be the winner today.

- Not only that... It's also the debut match of a player with an interesting story, right?

- Hahaha! The spectator who stormed onto the field because he couldn't stand just watching, right?

- Yes, that spectator has now become a player for Parma and is entering the field.

It's a game with many interesting elements.

The element of a match between a team relegated from Serie A and a team promoted from Serie C was quite intriguing.

And the debut match of the protagonist of the incident where a spectator stormed onto the field and scored a goal in a friendly match was also an interesting element.

- Park Minho! This player is the protagonist of that incident. How will he perform for Parma? And will he succeed in the professional league?

- I'm curious. Really curious.

There was a lot of interest.

Parma's home fans looked at Park Minho with curiosity.

Would he be able to showcase his skills in an official match rather than a friendly?

Ternana had the first possession.

The referee brought the whistle to his lips.

Piiii!

With the sound signaling the start of the game, the players of both teams began to move according to their tactics.

Ternana took the initiative in the early stages.

With excellent activity and strong pressure, they made it difficult for Parma's players to advance with the ball.

"Pouring everything from the beginning."

Coach Alain Lavin furrowed his brows.

Parma's strength lay in excellent attacking development utilizing a solid second line of players.

Thanks to this, Parma had left a strong impression by scoring more than 3 goals per game in friendly matches.

But if a strength is clear, so is a weakness.

Parma's weakness was, of course, defense.

The midfielders in the third line tried to protect the defense and release the pressure.

But Ternana seemed to read Parma's thoughts and aggressively penetrated the center from the beginning of the game.

The players of Parma showed signs of bewilderment at the unexpectedly strong pressure.

Naturally, psychological pressure led to mistakes.

And due to a critical mistake, Parma had to fight hard from the beginning of the game.

Thud!

- Gooooooal!

- Ternana scores a leading goal just 7 minutes into the first half!

- A killer pass quickly slipped behind the defense after some exchanges in the center!

Ternana proved the reason for pouring out their energy from the start by producing results.

The score was 1-0.

The faces of Parma's players hardened.

* * *

Santiago, who played on the flank today, and Dennis Man's expressions hardened.

It was a mistake by the central defender Elias Cobout.

A player with active movements and the ability to utilize the team.

But his poor judgment and lack of ball skills held the team back this time.

At the same time, the tension in my shoulders, which had been tight due to the debut game, eased, and my vision seemed to widen.

"Definitely feels different from a friendly match."

Maybe I was a bit nervous.

Surely, I'm a nobody and a coward.

Turning my head, I saw Giovanni calming down the defense.

Right, it's just 1 goal so far.

Only 7 minutes into the first half.

The momentum had shifted to the opponent.

But if we break this flow?

It was a situation where Ternana, who had poured out their energy from the start, could easily collapse.

Moreover, Ternana was not Liverpool.

Their pressure wasn't perfect like Klopp's Liverpool I saw on TV.

There were gaps.

The Ternana defenders, who were looking at me like some kind of strange animal before the game started, were full of confidence.

I wanted to exploit those gaps and ruin the faces of those defenders.

Since the third line was in shambles, it would be a bit of a struggle.

The opponent had succeeded in a gamble by exhausting their energy.

So I'll overexert myself a bit and show them.

What kind of player I am.

- Number 24 Minho! He drops quite deep to receive the ball. It seems like he's trying to relieve the pressure on the third line.

- If he's a player who orchestrates the team's attack, he should occasionally show this kind of play.

As I dropped back to receive the ball, the passes flowed more smoothly.

The movements of the third-line midfielders seemed more comfortable than before.

However, it wasn't easy to make a forward pass from this position.

Time kept ticking.

Around the 20th minute of the first half?

The opponent's pressure weakened a bit.

Right, even Liverpool doesn't press for the entire 90 minutes.

"Take it!"

After passing the ball to Marian Kurtic and quickly scanning the surroundings, I saw a space.

"Santiago."

Santiago was in a good position.

The ball came back to me.

I quickly passed it to Santiago.

Simultaneously, I dashed forward.

- A slightly long pass?

- Seems like a missed pass.

A slightly long pass.

Everyone's eyes were filled with questions as they watched the pass heading to an ambiguous space.

But Santiago was different.

Seeing my eyes, Santiago confidently ran towards the direction the ball was rolling.

So fast that the Ternana defender, who was looking at the ball a bit lazily, was startled.

- Oh! Fast! Santiago! Santiago! He got the ball! The left flank is quickly penetrated!

- He's running! Fast! Fast!

Santiago, who cleanly broke through the left side, turned his head to check our attacking positions.

Gennaro Tatis placed in the center was out of reach.

Dennis Man, on the opposite side, was drawing the defender and penetrating the center.

It was unreasonable for Santiago, who wasn't good at passing, to pass to Dennis Man on the opposite side.

Eventually, Santiago, who turned his head to the center, made eye contact with me, who had comfortably positioned myself between the defenders.

Thud!

The pass Santiago sent found my feet.

It felt a bit long... but it was within a range I could handle.

An opponent player tried to close in on me.

But my eyes were already focused on the gap in Ternana's defense.

And soon, my left foot swung swiftly.

- Oh? Minho! A direct shot!

- Oh! Oh! Goooooal! Goal!

- Minho! A fantastic curving shot! He successfully sent a sensuous shot through the small gap in Ternana's defense!

- Amazing! Amazing!

The Ternana defender staring at me blankly.

An equalizer scored in the 21st minute of the first half.

As soon as I scored, I ran towards the stands.

Swoosh!

Sliding on my knees while clenching my fist, I heard the cheers from the Parma fans watching me.

"Minho! Minho! Minho!"

"Wow! This is it! This is it!"

"Park Minho! Park Minho! Park Minho!"

Feeling their intense heat, I shouted.

"Who am I!!!"

To my question, some home fans nearby shouted.

"Park- Minhoooooo!"

Hearing the cheers, I thought.

This might be addictive.
