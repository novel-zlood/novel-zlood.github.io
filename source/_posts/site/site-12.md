## 5. You Can Follow Along in a Day? (1)

I am a very timid person.

I think that can be both a disadvantage and an advantage at the same time.

"What does being timid have to do with training so late?"

"I still have doubts about my skills."

"Even after performing so well?"

Santiago looked at me with an exasperated expression.

Yeah, I still doubted myself.

I thought that this bubble could burst at any moment.

So, I was increasing my activity level.

It's not like I made a significant improvement.

But I was definitely a bit better than a few weeks ago.

Especially after observing Franco's movements.

Thanks to that, I could conserve my energy and lead the game as the team's heart during counterattacks.

Honestly, I was still worried even after doing all this.

I didn't know how long my strengths would continue to work against other teams.

So, I couldn't just sit still.

Honestly, even if I didn't contribute to defense, the more I moved in the attack, the easier it was for my teammates.

I confirmed that in the last match, so I worked even harder.

To avoid being left behind.

"To have such talent and to work so hard... Minho, you really are on a different level."

Santiago thought of me as some soccer genius.

But I'm not quite there yet.

Santiago clenched his fist.

"I'll train late today too."

Saying that, he joined my training.

But after 2 hours,

Santiago left early with a tired expression.

I trained for two more hours and then went home.

Santiago, that slacker...

Two hours of determination, really?

"You slacker."

From now on, you are a slacker.

### After Winning the First Round of the Italy Cup

I blended in with the players even faster.

However, there were still parts I found hard to follow.

Maybe because it's Italy.

The fashion was different.

"Seriously... Minho, you can't dress."

"Really?"

"What is up with that weird character T-shirt and orange shorts combo? And socks up to your ankles with slippers? Damn! Damn! Damn!"

I've heard that I'm the worst fashion terrorist in the club... Honestly, I don't think it's that bad.

So, I asked in the group chat.

If I'm really that bad at dressing.

- MilanoLove: Human, are you serious?

- Roberto: It's quite bad. I was embarrassed sometimes in college.

- Park Minho: Really that bad?

- MilanoLove: Human, do you know what your friends at Parma University called you? Crazy Korean Terrorist. You crazy person!

- KingWangJjangJuve: Even if Park Minho wears rags, Juventus will support him. Please come to Juventus!

- MilanoLove: What’s this beggar team?

- RealMilan: There it is, the trash team showing off again? Juventus, who got beaten by Inter last year, showing off again?

- KingWangJjangJuve: Wait... The moment Park Minho joins Juventus... The King is back! The king of Serie A will take the throne again. That's Grand Juventus.

- Park Minho: I have no thoughts of going to Juventus though?

- KingWangJjangJuve: ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

- MilanoLove: Hahaha Juve? If it's Minho, it's definitely AC Milan hahaha

- RealMilan: Haha What? Juve? Minho's next team is definitely last season's champion Inter, right?

- Park Minho: Anyway, am I that bad at dressing?

- Roberto: Yep

"Am I really that bad at dressing?"

I didn't think it was that bad.

Listening to my friends, it seemed I wasn't very good at dressing.

I should just wear comfortable sportswear.

- Monica: If you have time, do you want to go shopping with me?

Hm, going shopping with Monica?

It didn't seem like a bad idea.

Since she was a model, she would know much more about fashion than I did.

But wasn't she busy?

- Park Minho: Aren't you busy these days?

- Monica: I have about a week free.

- Park Minho: Then, how about meeting in two days?

Five minutes after my response,

Monica's reply came in.

- Monica: Sure.

### Monica Argento

Born to an Italian father and an English mother, she lived in Italy until she was 12.

Then, at 13, she moved to London with her mother and lived there until she was 21.

She returned to Parma, Italy, in the winter of 21 and jumped into the modeling industry, gaining quite a bit of popularity and leading a busy life.

"I was lucky."

That's what she thought.

That she was lucky.

Plans in Paris and Milan were canceled, giving her about two weeks of free time.

Thanks to that, she could come to her father's house in Parma and relax.

Because of that, she could watch Park Minho's debut match from the stands and use the excuse of going shopping to have a date.

Of course, that clueless idiot didn't know.

Even though she had shown hints for a year, that blockhead didn't realize her feelings.

- Roberto: You're just the same.

- Monica: What do you mean?

- Roberto: Sigh...

She closed her smartphone and looked up, seeing a man who clearly looked like "I am Park Minho."

Lowering her sunglasses slightly, she saw Park Minho smiling and waving at her.

"Monica! Long time no see."

"Yeah, how have you been?"

"I've been good."

It was strange.

Whenever she stood in front of this man, her mouth would stiffen.

Monica thought.

It was truly strange.

"Shall we go?"

"Yeah, where do you want to start?"

"Let's go over there first."

The conversation stopped again.

They walked around the city, browsing clothing stores.

Monica personally picked out outfits for Park Minho that were comfortable yet wouldn't earn him the title of a fashion terrorist.

"If you wear it like this, you'll at least look decent. Well... it would be better if you dressed up more, but honestly, Minho, you're not the type to dress up."

"That's right."

"Then, this top should be good."

Monica picked out long sleeves, hoodies, and sweatshirts that could be worn casually and moved to another store to buy bottoms.

Of course, Park Minho's hands started to fill with shopping bags.

"Do I need this much?"

"This is the basic. If you wear these clothes properly, you'll at least avoid being the worst-dressed in Serie B."

"I see."

Park Minho nodded briefly.

Monica found that look very attractive.

Thinking that his face was really handsome, they moved to the next store.

Unlike Italian men who would gesture and talk to any woman, Park Minho was quiet.

No, he was too quiet.

But Monica didn't mind that.

Moreover, the subtle consideration that came from his quiet personality was even more attractive.

Park Minho gently grabbed Monica's shoulder and pulled her into his arms.

At the same time, an old man riding a bicycle zoomed past Monica.

"Are you okay?"

This was why she couldn't help but like him.

Monica thought, smiling.

"Yeah, I'm fine."

### In the Past, Our Platoon Leader Said

First loves are hard to forget.

Even after getting married, he still remembered.

I agree with that.

Seeing my unrequited love and first love, Monica, made my heart race again.

But I couldn't show it, so I quietly followed Monica around and enjoyed shopping.

Honestly, I was a bit tired.

But seeing Monica's smiling face wasn't so bad.

- Roberto: So, did you have dinner together?

- Park Minho: No? We just parted ways after shopping.

- Roberto: You son of a...

- Park Minho: Why are you suddenly cursing?

Sometimes I couldn't understand Roberto.

Whenever it came to Monica, he made me out to be some dull, clueless guy.

- Park Minho: Honestly, if Monica had any interest in me, wouldn't she have suggested having dinner first?

- Roberto: Have you ever thought that maybe Monica is waiting for you to confess?

- Park Minho: That's not it. Why would Monica, who isn't lacking anything, wait for a confession from a guy like me?

- Roberto: You really are a son of a... I think you'll live alone forever.

- Park Minho: Isn't that a curse?

- Roberto: Yep, it's a curse, you son of a...

There weren't any such signs.

Besides, I thought Monica, being a model, would avoid dating anyone.

Anyway.

Wearing the clothes Monica picked, I went to the training ground the next day, and some players looked surprised.

"Minho... is wearing normal clothes!"

"Alright! Pay up 3 euros each, 3 euros each!"

"Why do I always lose when I bet on the obvious? I can't understand, I just can't!"

I felt a bit upset.

Betting on my outfit.

"What was the obvious bet?"

"Surely, 'he's wearing something weird today' was the low odds bet. Only Giovanni and Gennaro bet on 'he's wearing normal clothes' this time."

"..."

I would go rogue.

Tomorrow, I would wear a hoodie with Nicolas Cage's face printed large on it.

Darn teammates.

Santiago, were you in on the obvious bet too?

Darn slacker.

Just you wait.

I'll see if I pass the ball to you in the Serie B opener in a few days.

### Whoa!

Serie B debut match.

The opponent was 'Como 1907,' a team that got promoted like Ternana.

They were the champions of Serie C Group A.

Group B's champions were Perugia.

AC Perugia was dissolved and reformed as Perugia Calcio in 2005, and they were promoted to Serie B this season.

Group C was our Italy Cup first-round opponent, Ternana.

Anyway.

This team came out with a 4-2-3-1 formation.

We, as always, used a 3-3-1-3 formation.

As I had resolved, I couldn't pass the ball to Santiago.

Because I wasn't a starter.

I started on the bench this time.

Santiago was placed in the center.

On the sides were Valentin Mihaila and Yann Karamoh, making it a more aggressive lineup.

The common point among the three players placed in the second line was that they were excellent on-the-ball players.

With these three high-activity players matching up with the highly collaborative Gianluca, the score came out quickly.

- Goooooal!

- Gianluca! He scores the opening goal!

- Santiago dragged two defenders and made a cutback, creating a great chance for Gianluca.

- No matter how lacking Gianluca's finishing skills are, he wouldn't miss such a chance.

- That's right!

With the opening goal.

Parma, pressing continuously, secured a 3-0 score in the first half, sealing the victory early.

And in the 41st minute of the second half, I was substituted in for Santiago and stepped onto the field.

Although the time was too short to rack up any attacking points.

The team won 4-1.

It was a good start.

After the opener ended.

Coach Alain Lavin called me over.

He said I'd be starting in the next match.

And,

He said I'd be playing on the left side.

The left side.

It was my first time playing on the flank.

Having only played in the center, I was worried about playing on the wing.

So, I went to the club's analysis team.

And asked.

"Is there a player whose play I can learn from on the flank?"

After a moment of thought, Analyst Thomas brought up some video footage.

"How about this guy? If you can play like him, I believe you can grow even more."

"His name is... Ethan Michael Hazard..."

"No, you read it wrong."

"Oh! Eden Hazard. Right? The one at Real Madrid now, who used to play at Chelsea."

"Yes, it's footage of Eden Hazard from his Chelsea days, not Real Madrid. I didn't capture much... but I collected a lot of data on Hazard when I worked at Fulham."

It was a 4-hour video.

According to Thomas, he had added his own analysis as subtitles in the video.

"Minho, you play like a traditional number 10 in the center... But if you can move like Eden Hazard on the left, I guarantee you'll be a player whose name goes down in history."

"Oh... It's not that much. Anyway, I'll take a good look. Thanks, Thomas."

"Well, it may not help much, but you'll at least learn how to move on the flank."

Thomas's lip service was too sweet.

Anyway, I took the video home.

- Eden Hazard is fast!

- Hazard moves up. Hazard! Higuain! 1-2 pass with Higuain! Then breaks through and shoots!

- Goooooal Hazard! Hazard!

"Wow... So you can move like that too."

Not just the left wing, but he moved freely to the center and right, switching positions.

Quick pace and delicate ball control.

Agile movements and excellent passing ability.

A left winger with great playmaking skills.

But beyond those strengths, Hazard's biggest advantage that made him world-class was his overwhelming 'dribbling.'

"In the past, I just thought he was good when watching on TV... Seeing it analyzed like this, it's on another level."

Is this what a true genius is?

I felt a bit intimidated.

"Still, let's try to learn slowly."

First, that dribbling.

If I could somehow mimic that dribbling.

Then at least I wouldn't be a burden on the left side.

I spent the whole day watching the Hazard analysis video.

Then started practicing those dribbles and movements at the training ground two days later.

"It's not easy."

World-class indeed felt different.

"This crazy guy. Can he really move like that on the flank?"

"This is what real talent is."

"This is driving me nuts. I thought our coach had a delusion of grandeur by putting Minho on the flank, but..."

"Maybe our coach is not delusional but a real genius?"

"If Minho ends up playing as a defender, should I pack up and transfer?"

"Don't worry. As the defensive midfielder, I'd be the first to get kicked out."

But Gianluca and a few other players looked at me in shock.

I hadn't even managed to imitate half of Eden Hazard.

Why were they so surprised?

I couldn't understand.

Then August 25th arrived.

The second round of Serie B.

An away match against S.P.A.L.
