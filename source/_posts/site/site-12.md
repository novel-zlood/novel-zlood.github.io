## 5. You Can Follow Along in a Day? (1)

I'm a scaredy-cat.

This can be a disadvantage.

But at the same time, I think it can be an advantage.

"What does being scared have to do with training this late?"

"I'm still uncertain about my skills."

"Even after performing so well?"

Santiago looked at me with eyes that said he couldn't understand.

Yeah, I still doubted myself.

I thought I didn't know when this bubble would burst.

That's why I've been increasing my activity.

That doesn't mean I've gotten significantly better.

But it's definitely a bit better than a few weeks ago.

Especially observing Franco's movements.

Thanks to that, I could conserve energy and become the heart of the team during counterattacks to lead the game.

Honestly, even doing this, I was worried.

I didn't know how long my strengths would continue to work against other teams.

So I couldn't just sit still.

Honestly, even if I didn't contribute to defense, the more I moved in attack, the more comfortable my teammates became.

I confirmed that in the last game, so I worked even harder.

To avoid falling behind.

"With such talent... you're still working hard. Minho, you're truly on another level."

Santiago thinks I'm some soccer genius.

I'm not quite at that level.

Santiago clenched his fist.

"I'll stay and train late today as well."

With that, he joined my training.

But after 2 hours.

Santiago went home first, looking exhausted.

I trained for another 2 hours before going home.

That Santiago guy...

Is 2 hours of determination even a thing?

"You lazy guy."

From now on, you are Lazy.

* * *

After winning the first round of the Coppa Italia.

I blended in more quickly with the players.

However, there were still parts that were hard to follow.

Maybe it was because we were in Italy.

The fashion was unique.

"Seriously... Minho can't dress well."

"Really?"

"What's with that odd character T-shirt and orange shorts combo? And socks up to your ankles with slippers? Damn! Damn! Damn!"

I heard that I'm the worst fashion terrorist in the club... Honestly, I don't think it's that bad.

So I asked in the group chat.

If I really dressed that poorly.

-MilanoLover: Human, are you even asking?

-Roberto: It's pretty bad. There were embarrassing moments during college.

-Park Minho: Really?

-MilanoLover: Human, do you know what your friends at Parma University called you? Crazy Korean Terrorist, you madman!

-KingAwesomeJuve: Juventus supports Park Minho even if he wears rags. Please come to Juventus!

-MilanoLover: What is this beggar team?

-RealMilan: Look at this trash team acting up again! The Juve guy who got smashed by Inter last year is acting up again?

-KingAwesomeJuve: Just wait... The moment Park Minho joins Juventus... The King Is Back! The king of Serie A will reclaim the throne. That's the Great Juve.

-Park Minho: Huh? I have no plans to go to Juventus?

-KingAwesomeJuve: ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

-MilanoLover: Hahaha Juve? If it's Minho, it's definitely AC Milan hahaha

-RealMilan: Hahaha what? Juve? Obviously, Minho's next team is last season's champion Inter, isn't it?

-Park Minho: Anyway, am I really that bad at dressing?

-Roberto: Yes.

"Am I really that bad at dressing?"

I didn't think it was that bad.

Listening to my friends, it seems I'm not good at dressing.

I'll just wear comfortable sportswear.

-Monica: If you have time, want to go shopping for clothes with me?

Hmm, going shopping with Monica?

Doesn't sound bad.

Since she's a model, she knows fashion much better than I do.

But isn't she busy?

-Park Minho: Aren't you busy these days?

-Monica: I have about a week free.

-Park Minho: How about meeting in two days then?

5 minutes after I replied.

Monica's response came.

-Monica: Sure.

* * *

Monica Argento.

Born to an Italian father and an English mother, she lived in Italy until she was 12.

Then she moved to London with her mother at 13 and lived there until she turned 21.

Returning to Parma, Italy, in the winter of 21, she entered the modeling industry and had been living a busy life ever since.

"She was lucky."

That's what she thought.

That she was lucky.

With her schedule in Paris and Milan canceled, she suddenly had two weeks free.

Thanks to that, she could rest at her father's home in Parma.

And because of that, she could watch Park Minho's debut match directly from the stands, and even have a date under the pretext of shopping for clothes.

Of course, that clueless idiot had no idea.

Even though she had been hinting for a year, that blockhead never realized her feelings.

-Roberto: You're the same.

-Monica: What?

-Roberto: Sigh...

Closing her smartphone and lifting her head, she saw a man in the distance who screamed 'I'm Park Minho.'

Lowering her sunglasses slightly, she saw Park Minho smiling brightly and waving.

"Monica! Long time no see."

"Yeah, how have you been?"

"I've been good."

It was strange.

Whenever she stood in front of this man, she became speechless.

Monica thought.

It was really strange.

"Shall we go?"

"Sure, where to first?"

"Let's start over there."

Again, the conversation stopped.

Walking around the city, they looked at clothing stores.

Monica personally coordinated outfits for Park Minho that were comfortable yet wouldn't earn him the title of a fashion terrorist.

"If you just wear these basics, you'll at least give off a decent vibe. Well... it would be better to dress up more, but honestly, Minho, you're not the type to dress up much."

"That's true."

"Then, this would be good for the top."

Monica packed long sleeves, hoodies, and sweatshirts that were easy to wear, and then moved to another store to buy bottoms.

Naturally, Park Minho's hands started to fill up with shopping bags.

"Do we need this much?"

"This is the basics. If you just put on the clothes we bought, you can at least avoid being the worst-dressed in Serie B."

"I see."

Park Minho nodded briefly.

Monica found that very charming.

Thinking his face was really handsome, she moved to the next store.

Unlike Italian men who would gesture and talk to every woman, Park Minho was quiet.

No, he was too silent.

But Monica didn't find that bad.

On top of that, the subtle consideration that came from his quiet personality made him even more attractive.

Park Minho gently grabbed Monica's shoulder and pulled her into his arms.

At the same time, an old man on a bicycle zoomed past Monica.

"Are you okay?"

This is why she couldn't help but like him.

Monica thought that as she smiled.

"Yeah, I'm okay."

* * *

In the past, our company commander said.

First love is not easily forgotten.

He said he still remembered it even though he was married.

I agree with that.

Seeing my crush and first love Monica made my heart pound again.

But I couldn't show it, so I quietly followed Monica around while enjoying shopping.

Honestly, it was a bit tiring.

But seeing Monica's smiling face wasn't bad.

-Roberto: So, did you have dinner together?

-Park Minho: No? We just parted ways after shopping.

-Roberto: You damned fool.

-Park Minho: Why are you suddenly swearing?

Sometimes I can't understand Roberto.

When it comes to Monica, he always makes me out to be some clueless and dense guy.

-Park Minho: Honestly, if Monica had any interest in me, wouldn't she have suggested dinner first?

-Roberto: Have you ever thought that maybe Monica is waiting for your confession?

-Park Minho: No way. Why would Monica, who has everything, be waiting for a confession from someone like me?

-Roberto: You're really a damned fool. I think you'll live alone forever.

-Park Minho: Isn't that a curse?

-Roberto: Yes, it's a curse. You damned fool.

I didn't notice any such signs.

Besides, since Monica is a model, she might avoid dating someone.

Anyway.

When I wore the clothes Monica picked out and went to the training ground the next day, some players had surprised expressions.

"Minho... is wearing normal clothes!"

"Alright! Hand over 3 euros each. 3 euros each!"

"Why is it that whenever I bet on the obvious choice, this happens? I can't understand. I just can't!"

I felt a bit annoyed.

Betting on what I wear.

"What was the obvious choice?"

"Surely, 'Today, he will wear something weird again' had the lowest odds. Only Giovanni and Gennaro bet on 'He will wear normal clothes today,' right?"

"..."

I'm going to rebel.

Tomorrow, I'll wear a hoodie with a huge print of American actor Nicolas Cage on it.

Damn teammates.

Santiago, were you also betting on the obvious choice?

Damn lazy guy.

Just wait and see.

A few days later, at the Serie B opener, let's see if I pass the ball to you.

* * *

Wooooo!

Serie B debut match.

The opponent was 'Como 1907,' a promoted team like Ternana.

They were the champions of Serie C Group A.

The champions of Group B were Perugia.

AC Perugia was dissolved and reestablished as Perugia Calcio in 2005, and they were promoted to Serie B this time.

The champions of Group C were our first-round Coppa Italia opponents, Ternana.

Anyway.

This team came out with a 4-2-3-1 formation.

We used our usual 3-3-1-3 formation.

As I resolved, I couldn't pass the ball to Santiago.

Because I wasn't a starter.

This time, I started on the bench.

Santiago was placed in the center.

On both sides were Valentin Mihaila and Yann Karamoh, making it a more attacking lineup.

The common trait of the three players positioned in the second line was that they were all excellent on-the-ball players.

These three players had a lot of activity and excellent connection skills, making it easy to get points early when matched with Gianluca.

-Gooooooal!

-Gianluca! He gets the opening goal!

-Santiago pulled two defenders and made a cutback pass, giving Gianluca a great chance.

-No matter how much Gianluca lacks finishing skills as a striker, he wouldn't miss such a chance, right?

-Exactly!

After the opening goal.

Parma, who continued to press, confirmed the victory early with a 3-0 score in the first half.

And at the 41st minute of the second half, I stepped onto the field, substituting for Santiago.

Although I didn't have enough time to get any attack points.

The team won 4-1.

It was a good start.

After the match.

Coach Alain Levagne called me.

He said I'd start in the next game.

And.

He said I'd be playing on the left.

On the left.

I've never played on the wing before.

I've always played in the center.

I was a bit worried.

So I went to the scouting department within the club.

And I asked.

"Are there any players on the wing that I could learn from?"

After a moment of thought, Thomas, the analyst, brought someone’s video.

"What about this guy? If you can play like him, I’m sure Minho will grow even more."

"His name is... Ethan Michael Hazard..."

"No, you read it wrong."

"Oh! Eden Hazard. Right? The one who used to play for Chelsea and is now at Real Madrid."

"Yes, it's the data of Eden Hazard during his Chelsea days. Although I couldn't gather much... While I was at Fulham, I collected a lot of data on Hazard."

It was a total of 4 hours of footage.

Thomas said he had annotated the footage with his analysis.

"Minho, you play more like a traditional number 10 in the center... If you can move like Eden Hazard on the left, I guarantee you'll be a player whose name will go down in history."

"Come on... that's too much. Anyway, I'll watch it. Thanks, Thomas."

"I'm not sure how helpful it will be. But at the very least, you'll understand how to move on the wing."

Thomas's sweet words were comforting.

Anyway, I took the footage home.

-Eden Hazard is fast!

-Hazard is moving up. Hazard! Higuain! One-two pass with Higuain! Breakthrough and shoot!

-Gooooooal Hazard! Haaaaazard!

"Wow... he can move like that."

Not only on the left wing but also moving freely to the center and the right, switching positions.

Fast pace and delicate ball control.

Agile movements and excellent passing ability.

A left-winger with great playmaking skills.

But more than those traits, what made Hazard world-class was his overwhelming 'dribbling.'

"When I watched him on TV in the past, I just thought he was good... Watching the analyzed footage, it's on another level."

Is this what a true genius is?

I felt a bit intimidated.

"Still, let's learn slowly."

First, that dribbling.

Let's try to mimic that dribbling somehow.

Then, at least I won't be a burden on the left wing.

I watched Hazard's analysis footage all day.

And two days later, I started practicing that dribbling and movement at the training ground.

"It's not easy."

Indeed, world-class players are different.

"Crazy... can he really move like that on the wing?"

"This is real talent."

"This is driving me nuts. I thought the coach had lost his mind sending Minho to the wing...”

“Actually... isn't our coach a real genius, not just having a genius complex?"

"If he says Minho will play as a defender later, should I pack my bags and transfer?"

"Don't worry. I, the defensive midfielder, will be the first to be kicked out."

But Gianluca and some players were looking at me in shock.

I couldn't even mimic half of Eden Hazard.

Why were they so surprised?

I couldn't understand.

And then, August 25th arrived.

The second round of Serie B.

An away match against S.P.A.L.
