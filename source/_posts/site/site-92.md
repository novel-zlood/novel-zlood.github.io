## 34. Premier League Opening Match (2)

The manager of Manchester United.

Helge Sharby Stoway squinted his eyes and muttered.

"A striker better than I thought."

Helge, the legendary Norwegian striker and the manager who led FC Porto to a league victory last season, had become the manager of Manchester United.

The preseason results were not bad.

With a 4-2-3-1 formation and having acquired all the players he wanted, he was aiming for the league title this season.

However.

Park Minho scored his debut goal at Old Trafford, putting Arsenal ahead 1-0.

This wasn’t the scenario he had envisioned.

Despite Manchester United's overwhelming attacking lineup, they hadn't shown their full potential by the halfway point of the first half.

"Not good."

He had a bad feeling.

-Pass to Paul Pogba!

-Long to the center! But Marco Torreira intercepts! Arsenal starts the counterattack again!

-It's fast! Pass to Tyler Smith Rowe! And Lorenzo Lupo-o-o-o!

-Oh! Jordi De Gea-a-a-a! The guardian of Manchester United saves them from a crisis!

"Focus! What are you doing!"

Jordi De Gea, who made a fantastic save to prevent a goal, shouted at Manchester United's players to concentrate.

On the other hand, Arsenal was relaxed.

From the moment Park Minho's goal went in, they had shown overwhelming performance against Manchester United.

Especially, with Bruno Campos and Marco Torreira joining, Arsenal's midfield was significantly stronger than last season, shaking Manchester United's center.

However, one downside was that Arsenal's attack transition felt a bit slow to fully utilize Park Minho's speed.

This couldn’t be helped.

Manchester United's pressing was quite intense.

It seemed Arsenal's players were not accustomed to quickly overcoming the press and turning it into a counterattack.

Still, it was clear that Arsenal had the upper hand.

The commentators screamed whenever Park Minho got the ball.

-Minho! He grabs the ball and runs again!

-He breaks through the flank in an instant! But Lorenzo Lupo, who is a bit slow, couldn't get into position!

-Hurry up, Arsenal!

Despite the lack of support from his teammates, Park Minho was composed.

Believing he wouldn't lose the ball, the remaining Arsenal players quickly joined the attack.

Park Minho's cross went up smoothly.

With a determination to score this time, Lorenzo Lupo leaped high.

-Lorenzo Lupo-o-o-o!

-Gooooal! Lorenzo Lupo! Successfully utilizing his height to score!

-Arsenal quickly takes a 2-0 lead!

Old Trafford fell into despair in an instant.

* * *

Two goals in the first half.

Arsenal had scored against Manchester United.

Of course, Manchester United was quite formidable as well.

In the 44th minute of the first half, they earned a penalty kick opportunity.

Cristiano Ronaldo, as expected, was Manchester United's penalty kicker.

-Ronaldo.

-He steps up to the ball.

It was a crisis situation caused by a mistake from the young defender Craig Martin, but Marlon Ramsdale calmly stared at Ronaldo who stood in front of the ball.

Ronaldo then ran towards the ball.

Marlon Ramsdale quickly decided on a direction and dove, but.

Ironically, Ronaldo kicked the ball in the opposite direction to the goalkeeper and grabbed his head, looking up at the sky.

-Aaaaaah! Ronaldo! Misses the penalty!

-Ronaldo misses the crucial penalty!

-Ronaldo misses this great opportunity!

The home fans of Old Trafford screamed in agony.

Disappointed voices of the Red Devils could be heard.

"Just let Sancho take the penalty!"

"Ronaldo! Get your head in the game!"

I could even hear the home fans' criticisms.

It meant they were greatly disappointed.

Anyway, the first half ended as soon as the crisis was over.

The score was 2-0, with Arsenal completely dominating Manchester United.

As soon as we entered the away locker room, Coach Alain greeted the players with a bright smile.

He let the players rest for about 10 minutes and then boosted the atmosphere by encouraging them for the remaining 5 minutes.

"Keep doing what you did in the first half."

"It's not my tactics that are superior to the opponent's manager. You guys are winning because you are better than those dumb Manchester United players."

"Play the second half with confidence."

With those words, halftime ended.

Manchester United entered the field with a renewed sense of determination, having received a good scolding from Coach Helge.

Although we scored two goals in the first half, Manchester United didn't collapse easily in the second half.

Manchester United's defense became even more solid, as if they couldn't afford to concede any more goals.

Well, thanks to that, I didn't have much fun either.

On the other hand, because Manchester United's defense had dropped back a bit, Junseo hyung and Jadon Sancho, who utilized speed, showed a less effective performance than in the first half.

Even though Korean football fans call them "Maenggu," Manchester United was undoubtedly a strong team.

But it didn’t seem like we were going to lose.

"Minho!"

A pass was directed to me.

But I had no choice but to turn the ball back again.

Having suffered heavily from me in the first half, Manchester United's defense had built an even tighter defensive wall.

-The sluggish atmosphere continues until the 10th minute of the second half.

-Manchester United should start attacking soon.

-As I speak, Shin Junseo! He grabs the ball and runs fast! Shin Junseo quickly passes Kamiyas Takehiro!

Indeed, Manchester United didn’t just sit back and take it.

Junseo hyung sprinted 30 meters in an instant, breaking through the flank and sending a cross.

A cross that went up at the perfect timing.

Cristiano Ronaldo, who got an unmarked chance, jumped high.

Everyone expected Arsenal to concede a goal.

But Ronaldo's form seemed off today.

He missed the perfect opportunity.

-Aaaaaah! Ronaldo! Ronaldo! He wastes this great opportunity!

-Ronaldo misses both opportunities today!

-Oh....... This seems to be the worst performance. It seems like Ronaldo is definitely aging.

-He's already 38, right?

-Yes, Ronaldo is now approaching 40.

Ronaldo missed two perfect opportunities.

I could see Junseo hyung returning to his position with a face full of regret.

It seems like no one can hide their age.

If it were the past Ronaldo, he would have definitely scored, but he wasted that great opportunity too easily.

Of course, thanks to that, we became quite comfortable.

-Arsenal! They continue to dominate Manchester United in the second half, playing their game slowly!

-They are certainly different from last season. Especially the toughness of the two midfielders in the center is clearly working in Arsenal's favor.

We weren't losing the midfield battle.

Our defense was quite solid.

The attackers were stacking up meaningful stats.

Honestly, I was a bit worried during the preseason, but Arsenal's strength wasn't bad at all.

No, rather, it felt like Manchester United’s strength was more lacking than I thought.

Anyway.

What I liked most was that we continued to hold the initiative at Old Trafford.

And then, in the 21st minute of the second half, Bruno Campos' fantastic 30-meter long-range shot hit the mark.

-Gooooal!

-Arsenal! They widen the score gap to 3-0 against Manchester United at Old Trafford!

-Oh! This is not good! Manchester United! They trail Arsenal 3-0 at their home!

-The movements on the flanks were enough to baffle Arsenal's defense. But ultimately, the difference in focus during the finishing touches from the players seems to have led to this result.

As the third goal went in.

The home fans of Manchester United at Old Trafford booed in disappointment.

Some fans even started leaving the stadium, clearly showing how powerless Manchester United was today.

"Minho! You were amazing!"

"It was also because the opponent made mistakes. We were lucky."

"Hahaha! Even if it was luck. I want to keep winning like this."

Lorenzo Lupo laughed brightly.

Well, it was just the opening match, so I wondered if it was okay to be this happy.

But a win was a win.

It seemed okay to be a little happy.

Anyway.

The game ended with a 3-0 victory.

Arsenal secured a perfect opening game victory away from home.

Conversely, Manchester United collapsed with a 3-0 defeat to Arsenal in their Old Trafford opener.

Naturally, the media eagerly tore into the wounded Manchester United.

[Arsenal! Wins 3-0 at Manchester United's home!]

[Park Minho! A magnificent performance with 1 goal and 1 assist! The god of Parma was special at Arsenal too!]

[Arsenal's number 10 is special! Arsenal fans line up to buy Park Minho's jersey!]

[A perfect opening victory! How did Arsenal beat Manchester United 3-0?]

[A tougher midfield! Sharper flanks! The changed Arsenal is centered around Minho and Bruno Campos?]

[Coach Alain, ‘It was a perfect victory. The players executed the movements I asked for.’]

[Coach Helge, ‘We were unlucky. It was a winnable game. We will definitely win next time.’]

[Cristiano Ronaldo, who made two mistakes, quickly leaves the stadium to avoid journalists!]

[Manchester United fans chant 'Ronaldo OUT!']

-King God General Blazing Charisma Minho-oo-oo-oo!

-Hahaha, Ronaldo is completely destroyed, lol.

-The Ronaldo who used to flatter China! Suck it, hahaha.

-Really……. Is this the Arsenal I know? My chest swells with pride! Their movements are completely different.

-Bruno Campos and Park Minho……. It seems Arsenal made great signings this time.

-Yup, Craig Martin seemed a bit unstable……. Well, he’s just a 20-year-old defender, and he’s good enough.

-Frankly, with Ramsdale, it's enough to cover.

-Really……. Can Arsenal rise now?

-The singularity is coming!

Arsenal fans were thrilled with this opening match victory.

Honestly, it felt a bit burdensome to get this excited.

But I couldn’t tell them not to have high expectations.

-Monica: Minho-oo-oo-oo-oo!

-Monica: Red Devils cut! Ronaldo cut! Shin Junseo cut!

-Monica: You must have seen the power of the strongest Arsenal, right?

Monica, rampaging like a warrior in the group chat.

I couldn’t bring myself to stop her.

When I got home, Monica ran up to me, jumping with joy, and kissed my cheek excitedly.

She was much more energetic than usual.

"This isn't a dream, right? Is it?"

Her words sparked a mischievous streak in me.

"Yeah, this is a dream."

"What?"

"Actually, I transferred to Manchester United, and today Arsenal lost 3-0 to Manchester United."

She laughed and replied.

"Hahaha! Minho, stop joking!"

But when I looked at her with a serious expression, she suddenly broke into a cold sweat and brought out a spinning top from somewhere and spun it in front of me.

It was similar to the small top from the movie Inception, and she stared at the spinning top, praying earnestly.

Her cute appearance made me burst into laughter.

Only then did Monica realize I was joking, and she hit my back fiercely, puffing her cheeks.

And that night.

Monica had a nightmare where I transferred to Manchester United and scored a hat-trick against Arsenal, groaning in bed.

"Minho……. No! Not Manchester United!"

Watching her, I quietly shook my head.

Monica's love for Arsenal was truly severe.
