## 38. The Value of a Name (1)

Recently, there has been a discussion in overseas football communities.

[Title: Ethan Blacksmith is Honestly Overrated.]

-Content-

This guy is so overrated. He barely passes at Brighton, a mid-to-low tier team, begging for assists, and most of his goals are from penalties or free kicks. He’s an overrated midfielder.

Honestly, the reason he’s popular is because of his name. Like Brighton's former manager, Steven Gerrard, he’s benefiting from the "Hum-Ba-Hum-Ba-ron" effect.

If his name wasn’t Ethan Blacksmith but something like "Mduku Bongbubaka," he would be struggling in the second division with Sunderland.

Of course, his market value would likely be half of what it is now.

[Comments]

-Hum-hyung……. Are you doing well at Brighton?

-LOL

-Hum-ba, following after Bang-twa, now it’s Bongbubaka-ron LOL

-Honestly, I don't think this guy’s skills are at the level of a team's ace at all.

-For an ace of a mid-to-lower tier team, his stats are poor, and he mostly goes stealth for 90 minutes, occasionally recording an assist or a goal, acting all critical while nodding his head, which is infuriating.

-LOL Ethan Blacksmith recorded 8 goals and 11 assists last season, but the armchair Fergusons don’t acknowledge it LOL

-Yeah, 6 of those goals were penalties, right?

-LOL How come only 2 field goals? Even other third-line midfielders score 3-4 goals a season.

This is about Ethan Blacksmith, a midfielder who’s called the ace of Brighton, led by manager Steven Gerrard.

As you can see……. there’s been a controversy about him being overrated.

Well, in my opinion, 'Is this player really overrated?' comes to mind because he truly works hard and is a technically good player.

Of course, many people didn’t think so.

The evaluation inside England wasn’t very good either.

I found the reason for Ethan Blacksmith's poor evaluation in his face.

“He’s really handsome.”

His face brings back memories of Beckham.

No, he’s even better looking than Beckham and has a good personality, so of course women love him.

It seemed like he was underrated because of his face.

Honestly, his skills are good enough to consistently contribute as a valuable player, even if he joins a top-tier team.

Last season, it was his work that kept the team from relegation, so to Brighton fans, he’s almost a beloved future franchise star.

Moreover, he’s only 19 years old, extremely young.

A midfielder full of endless potential.

Actually, our coach also had an eye on this player, but he refused, saying:

-I’m not going to Arsenal.

-As expected, Liverpool is a prestigious club.

When this news spread through the yellow press, I heard that Gooners were greatly outraged.

I saw how angry Monica was at that time, and I didn’t go near the kitchen for about two days.

Anyway.

In such a situation, we were about to face Brighton.

Monica’s expectant gaze was directed at me.

It meant that she wanted me to score a lot this time.

I failed to score a hat-trick in the last North London Derby, so this time I must succeed.

It’s a bit of a burden.

But it’s not an impossible request.

Why am I so confident before playing the game?

Lately, I’ve been feeling exceptionally light.

Even in the past Serie A, on days when I felt this light, I was literally flying around.

It’ll probably be similar this time too.

* * *

-Gooooooal!

-Minhooooo! He brings down Tottenham!

-Amazing! He brings victory to Arsenal in the North London Derby!

In the quiet manager’s office at Brighton.

Manager Steven Gerrard sighed deeply as he watched the movements of the forward on the screen.

A tough opponent.

Watching the analysis video, he could see that this season’s Arsenal had the capability to challenge for the championship.

But this didn’t mean that manager Gerrard was giving up.

Since becoming the manager of Brighton, who escaped relegation last season, he had been improving the team’s structure.

He changed the disorganized defense line.

He brought up several promising players from the second team to the first team, starting a comprehensive rebuilding.

The results weren’t bad.

With a victory in the opening match and steadily accumulating points, they settled in 10th place in the league.

Based on strong pressing, manager Gerrard’s 4-3-3 formation had won against several teams.

Especially, Brighton’s solidified defense line maintained the title of the least conceded defense line, excluding the top 3 teams, until they suffered a 6-1 defeat against Manchester United.

Moreover, he also succeeded in integrating a promising player who would become the core of Brighton into the team.

Ethan Blacksmith.

The key contributor who allowed the team to stay in the Premier League last season.

This season, manager Gerrard also revamped the central midfield line around him.

And he saw some results from that.

But there were still regrets.

While the defense and midfield lines were completely rebuilt with young players, Brighton’s attacking line was still questionable.

With the existing attacking line clearly aging, the situation of goal-scoring was also in the lower ranks of the league.

Manager Steven Gerrard had no choice but to be deeply concerned, and seeing Arsenal’s attacking line, which was leading the league, he couldn’t help but sigh.

However, it wasn’t that they had no weaknesses.

This season, Arsenal’s squad, which showed solid defense and possession, had cracks.

Three of the main players were out due to injuries.

The fact that three young players were participating in this match was good news for Brighton.

“Craig Martin is somewhat stabilizing, but the other two aren’t.”

Left-back Kasper Nielsen and defensive midfielder Jake Francis could be Arsenal’s weaknesses.

Therefore, manager Steven Gerrard analyzed the players who could be Arsenal’s weaknesses thoroughly and further polished Brighton’s proud defensive organization.

While preparing steadily like that, the day of the 10th round of the Premier League finally arrived.

Manager Steven Gerrard, looking a bit tired, expressed satisfaction as he awaited Arsenal, who would visit their home.

* * *

It’s an away game.

After playing consecutive matches in the comfortable home ground recently, the long-awaited away game felt strangely tiring.

The expressions of the home fans heading to the ‘American Express Community Stadium’ in Brighton were filled with the belief that they would surely win.

“Why is the stadium name so long?”

“Fans call it Amex for short.”

“Still, Brighton fans shouldn’t have much to complain about the long name since they live thanks to Amex.”

“True……. American Express practically feeds the Brighton area.”

Before entering the field.

Listening to the conversation of these guys in the locker room, I could learn about the history and situation of the Brighton area, which was quite informative.

In Parma, the locker room was filled with shouts like ‘Minho!’, ‘Waaaah!’, ‘God of Parma!’ etc.…..

There were so many guys making strange noises that my ears hurt, but at Arsenal, there were no guys who lost their reason like that, which was nice.

Sometimes I want to hear the shouts of those enthusiastic players, but seeing the young players looking at me with sparkling eyes from a distance, it seemed like this locker room would soon become like Parma’s.

Anyway.

There’s a saying in the football world that a great player can’t be a great manager, but it didn’t seem to apply to our opponent, Brighton’s manager Steven Gerrard.

He’s certainly shown an excellent managerial side at Aston Villa and Brighton.

Seeing him like that, I often thought.

I want to be a football manager someday too.

When I shared this opinion with Lorenzo, that ungrateful forward shook his head in opposition.

The reason was that if I became a manager, the forwards of that team would get scolded by me so much that they would all run away.

Do I really look that bad?

When I pointed out Lorenzo’s mistakes from the last game, he retorted, ‘See? I told you!’

“You should play until you’re fifty.”

“Why?”

“So that I can retire earlier, become the manager of your team, and keep pushing you hard.”

Lorenzo made a sad face at my words.

Lately, this guy and that guy both lack trust.

But even though Parma was noisy, there were many guys who had strong faith in me.

Kenneth, Banjil, Joshua, Filippo, etc.

I miss these friends especially today.

“Minho, no matter how wistful you look at me, my opinion won’t change.”

“No sense of romance.”

Seriously.

This is why Lorenzo is hopeless.

He used to like me so much when we first met.

People really change.

Soon, the manager entered the locker room.

And he explained again how we would approach today’s game, providing detailed instructions.

“We’ll take it slow today. The opponent is a team that launches fiery attacks through strong pressing like Liverpool.”

“Of course, the difference between Liverpool and Brighton is the absence of a forward to finish those fiery attacks.”

“Honestly, if they create that many chances and still have only 15 team goals, there’s a problem.”

Considering that our manager said this, it seemed like Brighton’s forward line had quite a few issues.

Then he looked at me with eyes full of affection.

“We’ll slowly close in on the center and possess the ball. Instead of advancing, we’ll gradually take over the central area to withstand Brighton’s pressing.”

Everyone nodded as he told even the full-backs to move centrally and join the possession battle.

The manager instructed us to handle the ball safely without giving up any gaps, then connect the ball directly to the forwards once we eased the pressure in the center.

Our center had Lorenzo, a 2-meter giant, and the wingers were relatively fast.

It seemed like our manager was aiming for this part.

“Go out there and show them! Show them what kind of team we are! And who is the closest to winning this season!”

Lastly, he boosted the players' morale.

It seemed like our manager really wanted to win today.

Then I should work hard and bring victory.

That’s the duty of the team’s ace.

Let’s go and stir things up.

* * *

*Whistle*

Brighton, the home team, started with the kickoff.

As soon as the match began, the enthusiastic cheers of the Brighton fans were heard.

Especially, the cheering for the 19-year-old young midfielder placed in the center was incredibly intense.

The midfielder, with almost hexagonal abilities, was the main reason we planned to play a central-oriented game today.

-Brighton players are moving busily to seize the early momentum.

Contrary to our expectations, Brighton played the ball slowly, circulating it at a slow tempo.

It seemed like they were cautious of our attacking line, and the aggressive, pressing football Brighton was known for didn’t appear.

As a result, Brighton fans started to complain about Gerrard’s decision.

Already frustrated with the weak attacking line that couldn’t score properly, they were annoyed by the completely defensive tactics.

“What are they doing? Why are they sitting back even at home?”

“Let’s go on the attack! This isn’t football!”

“Since when did we play such boring football? Even when we lost 6-1 to Manchester United, we sat back and got beaten up!”

Look.

The complaints of the home fans close to the field were audible to me.

Well, Brighton’s decision was understandable.

It seemed like they aimed to secure at least one definite point from this match.

The reason was simple.

After this match, Brighton had to start a series of 4 consecutive away games beginning with Liverpool.

So, they wanted to secure at least one point at home before starting the hellish 4 consecutive away games.

It's a completely understandable thought.

As soon as we started moving centrally, Brighton’s young prodigy Ethan Blacksmith marked me tightly.

Brighton seemed to have prepared a lot.

“But...”

Thinking that they could block all of Arsenal’s attacks by just putting one marker on me was overly naive.

So, I had to show them.

What kind of player I am.

As soon as I got the ball, Tyler Smith-Rowe, who was moving to the flank, made a long move to the side, momentarily targeting Brighton’s gap.

Arsenal, which had been playing centrally, suddenly targeting the flanks with a long move startled Brighton, who hurriedly reorganized their lines to fend off Arsenal’s attack.

But Lorenzo and I didn’t miss the gap that appeared in the reorganization process.

“Pass it long to Lorenzo!”

At Bruno Campos’s shout, Tyler switched with me and kicked it long to Lorenzo Lupo running on the opposite flank.

-A pass to Lorenzo Lupo!

-Lorenzo neatly touches the long pass.

This time, as the pass went long to the opposite side, Brighton’s defense line revealed space in the half-space, momentarily shaking.

I didn’t miss that part.

Moving according to the pattern we practiced during training, Lorenzo made a neat cross.

I matched that cross and immediately launched a shot towards Brighton’s goal.

-Minhooooooo!

-A fantastic half-volley shooooooot!

-Gooooooal! Arsenal’s goooooooal in just 7 minutes of the first half! The scorer is Minho!

As my fantastic half-volley hit the net, Brighton’s home fans voiced their dissatisfaction with boos.

It seemed like they were frustrated by the unsatisfactory attack from Brighton in the early first half and the contrasting image of us scoring with just one attack.

More than that.

The young prodigy from Brighton who kept following and marking me seemed odd.

Should I say he looked significantly off form?

Seeing this guy reacting a bit late to my movements, I thought maybe I could really score a hat-trick today.

But.

What celebration should I do if I score a hat-trick?

Alright, I’ve decided.

In that legendary game, Demba Ba scored a goal and showed a bowing celebration.

If I score a hat-trick, I’ll follow that.

Someone would really love it.

I guarantee it.

They would really love it.
