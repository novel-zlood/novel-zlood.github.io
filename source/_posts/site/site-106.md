## 40. Watch My Soccer Lecture DVD! (1)

Recently, Monika said something like this:

"You seem much more confident now at Arsenal than you did back when you were at Parma."

Thinking back, I didn’t have much confidence in my skills when I was at Parma.

I had suddenly become a professional from being an ordinary person.

It was a time when I constantly doubted my potential.

But things changed when I transferred to Arsenal.

Meeting various players made me realize that my skills were better than I thought, and also that many things I said to Bbaengil back then were close to being embarrassing outbursts.

[Mino’s Overwhelming EPL Debut Season! A New ‘King’ Reborn at Arsenal!]

[Mino Showing Consistent Skills in Every Match!]

[Mino Ranked 1st in Transfer Market Value Surge!]

[Worth 250 billion KRW! Yet Several Clubs Are Eyeing Mino!]

[Real Madrid Hasn't Given Up on the ‘Super Galactico’.]

[Mino Led Arsenal to Victory Against Chelsea! What Will He Show in the Upcoming Match Against West Ham?]

After the match against Chelsea, we prepared for the away match against West Ham.

Since it was still in London, the burden of traveling wasn’t as heavy as with Chelsea, but some recent racist comments by a few West Ham fans on social media made things a bit tiring.

Just like in the past with Hyung Junseo, some vicious West Ham fans burned my uniform on social media, posting, "Came to London to sell DVDs! Get lost back to your country!"

Of course, the Gooners reacted fiercely, and a heated argument ensued on social media between Arsenal and West Ham fans.

It’s such a... peculiar feeling because the host of the ‘Arsenal FanTV’ channel had once made similar DVD-related racist remarks to Hyung Junseo during the North London Derby.

When I think about it... it’s clear that the racism against Asians in Europe hasn’t improved much compared to the past.

But, I have Monika to comfort me.

And compared to the past, there are more institutional efforts to prevent such racism.

So, I could tolerate it to some extent.

Though, it didn’t feel particularly good.

My agent Leo was furiously planning a strong response, but I had a better idea to handle this issue.

"Leo, please post this on my social media."

If they’re so eager to see a DVD, shouldn’t I show them myself?

Leo laughed heartily at my plan.

He said he loved the idea and would quickly prepare what I requested.

And two days later, a video was uploaded.

The video showed me giving a soccer lecture to kids in West Ham uniforms.

And the advertisement-like text below the video touched the hearts of EPL fans.

-Mino’s Soccer Lecture DVD, Episode 1!

-To be released on December 6, 2023, during the Premier League Round 14 away match against West Ham United!

If they want to see a DVD so badly.

Shouldn’t a superstar show it directly on the field?

* * *

The London Stadium, West Ham’s home ground, was packed with more spectators than usual.

Particularly, a few notorious Iron Hooligans were hurling all sorts of insults and jeers at Park Minho even before the match started.

Naturally, the West Ham players were no different.

The content Park Minho posted on his SNS the day before was a massive provocation to all of West Ham.

Though, they weren’t entirely faultless either.

The racist comments came from West Ham fans, and the West Ham club didn't properly address them.

But that didn’t mean they should lose humiliatingly.

The West Ham players vowed to win in front of their fans today.

If they were to suffer a crushing defeat… extreme fans might storm the field and engage in fistfights, so they couldn’t afford to lose.

The police had already organized the streets of London, and the guards inside the London Stadium were swallowing nervously, praying for a peaceful match.

Then, the players of both teams entered the field.

The West Ham fans greeted the Arsenal players with harsher insults and jeers than usual.

Of course, Park Minho’s expression remained unchanged.

He stood calmly among the players.

The players shook hands.

The West Ham players hoped for a quiet match today.

But they knew better than anyone that the outcome might not allow for that.

With bubbles falling like snowflakes at the London Stadium.

The referee’s whistle finally signaled the start of the first half.

West Ham lowered their line.

Typically, West Ham, known for their agile offense, enjoyed counterattacks exploiting gaps in the opponent's defense.

Especially using fast counterattacks involving Jarrod Bowen and Nikola Vlašić, which were considered powerful even within the EPL.

-West Ham lowers their line from the start, slowly pulling Arsenal into their territory.

-Last season, West Ham reaped significant benefits by isolating the opponent’s regista with strong forward pressure.

This season is no different.

West Ham's tactical movements adapt fluidly based on the position of the opponent's playmaker in the third line. Against Arsenal, they focused on the center, abandoning the flanks.

But the formation was different.

Unlike last season, West Ham primarily used a 3-4-3 formation this season.

However, the structural issues of their tactics remained unchanged.

When they sat back, they still maintained a five-back defense by actively dropping the wingbacks, similar to how the old West Ham used to have a midfielder or winger drop back to form a five-back.

The reason for switching from a four-back to a three-back was due to Declan Rice’s transfer to PSG.

Current West Ham manager Davis Butler couldn’t find a replacement for Declan Rice and ultimately had to change tactical aspects, painstakingly shaping the current West Ham.

Due to losing a key player, West Ham’s current season standings were a respectable 9th place in the league.

However, the frustration in attack due to the defensive utilization of wingbacks remained unresolved.

-West Ham focuses on defense.

-There were a few counterattack opportunities, but the movements of Niki Batshuayi, who replaced last season's counterattack pivot Antonio, are somewhat disappointing.

Last season, Antonio served as a target man, receiving long balls and initiating counterattacks with Jarrod Bowen and Nikola Vlašić, which proved effective for West Ham. Niki Batshuayi’s performance left much to be desired in comparison.

Naturally, failed counterattacks lead to crises.

Arsenal's attacking force, whom West Ham struggled to fend off with a five-back, started to move.

West Ham defender Lloyd Melly held the ball and watched Arsenal's player pressuring their defense line slowly.

It was Arsenal’s No. 10, Park Minho, the current EPL’s most feared attacker who had been the center of controversy since before the match.

‘How are we supposed to stop a player like him?’

Lloyd Melly regretted not joining Arsenal, who showed interest in him before the season started.

Of course, West Ham wasn’t a bad choice, so he didn’t regret it too much.

-Mino! Grabs the ball and swiftly bypasses two players!

-Lloyd Melly quickly rushes in! Mino’s fake! And shoooooots!

-Ah! The ball hits the post and goes out!

-Arsenal’s attack is quite fierce!

That was close.

If Lloyd Melly hadn’t quickly blocked Park Minho’s path and reduced the angle, it would have definitely been a goal.

Lloyd Melly, who slipped and fell on the grass, felt this match was going to be tough. He grabbed his teammate's hand and got up.

Still, his mood wasn’t entirely bad.

Arsenal’s interest in him remained, which gave him some motivation.

Moreover, considering Arsenal’s current position as league leaders, not the shaky team of the past, Lloyd Melly had significant interest in transferring.

He wanted to play for a bigger club, compete with outstanding teammates, and aim for the championship trophies every player desires.

The surest way to achieve that was a transfer, and a standout performance in today’s match would positively impact Lloyd Melly’s career.

Yes, Lloyd had high hopes.

But within the first 10 minutes of the first half, Arsenal and Park Minho continuously put him in danger, wrecking West Ham’s defense.

Yes, just hold on a bit longer.

As Park Minho, holding the ball, started to charge again in front of Lloyd Melly, he thought.

* * *

While I did provoke on social media due to some malicious West Ham fans, to be honest, I couldn’t guarantee a goal in today’s match.

That’s because, although a striker speaks with goals, it’s impossible to score in every match.

Even Messi has shown more abysmal performances than bottom-tier league strikers when he’s been silent.

Honestly, I’ve had some matches where my performance was seriously disastrous.

Since the ball is round.

You can never be sure of a match's result.

However, what I’ve realized through my professional career is that I possess better-than-average talent, and except for a few matches, my performance has always been above average.

Otherwise, why would Ronaldo from Korea, who gets criticized so much, bother to keep an eye on me on social media?

Anyway.

What I’m trying to say is that a striker can’t always score, but today, I felt good enough to probably earn some attacking points.

Lloyd Melly, the opposing defender, was rushing at me.

He had been tracking my movements well and had been sticking to me like a leech.

Ah, that’s a compliment.

There’s a saying in games, “Ah! They’re playing like jerks!” which is actually high praise, right?

In that sense, Lloyd Melly was an excellent player.

At the same time, proving my worth against such a player was really enjoyable.

-Mino! Quickly breaks through! Lloyd Melly stretches out his leg! Mino’s Marseille turn! Damn! Minooo! Penetrates West Ham’s tight defense with fantastic moves!

-Mino! Mino! Mino! This time a step over! Mino!

-Minooooo! Shooooots! Goooaaaal!

I moved like a madman for the first time in a while.

I hadn’t shown such destructive, skill-dependent play since my debut season with Parma.

Of course, the few Gooners who followed us away were trembling with excitement at my moves, while Lloyd Melly, collapsed on the field after being bypassed, stared at me with a dazed expression.

Ah! Almost forgot.

After scoring, I quickly ran to the broadcast camera and shouted.

“This is the content of my first lecture! Got it?”

West Ham fans must be loving this.
