## 11. Step Up? Level Up! (3)

While I was focusing on training,

Christmas came around.

It was a day to finally gather with friends.

I packed various things and even prepared the gift Monica wanted, and headed to Roberto's house.

Roberto's house wasn't that spacious,

but as expected of an architect's home, it had a very sophisticated feel.

Hmm... With my poor expression skills, it looked like a villa built by a nouveau riche Chinese person who bought land in Jeju Island.

Of course, if I said this to Roberto, he probably wouldn't even open the door for me, so I kept my mouth shut.

Fortunately, my friends whom I hadn't seen in a while looked well.

I thought it was really fortunate.

It's truly a good thing when friends are doing well.

Jusik was extremely happy because the clothes he designed were coming out soon.

Hyerin told us that she was doing very well, having been appointed as the temporary project team leader.

Seongkyung... she's working hard, but...

instead of talking about her own work, she cried because Juventus was struggling at 6th place in the league.

The problem was she kept saying the same thing,

and even cried, so it was quite chaotic.

She becomes a crybaby when she drinks... 

Who gave her the alcohol?

Oh, and I confessed accidentally.

If you ask why the one who confessed was so calm,

Honestly, it was because I was bewildered.

Overcome by the influence of alcohol and Roberto's coaxing, I gave her a ring as a gift and asked her to date me.

Monica replied, "Sure!"

Hyerin said something incomprehensible like, "It was a good thing to get the clueless guy drunk."

Roberto said he could finally sleep peacefully and patted me on the back.

After the party ended, on the way back,

I walked Monica home.

We were able to talk about many things.

From our first meeting with Monica,

to various stories until now,

and finally, we confirmed each other's feelings.

At the same time, I realized why Roberto and my friends saw me as a clueless guy.

Wow... I really acted like a fool, didn't I?

This is definitely a dark past.

Absolutely.

We had already arrived in front of Monica's house.

At the same time, a strange sense of guilt and the feeling of not wanting to let her go kept me from turning away.

Monica, too, seemed to be expecting something, standing there without going inside.

Having been clueless all this time, I was now certain that I had to speak up first.

If I acted like a fool, even kind-hearted Monica would be so frustrated that she might die.

"Can I come in and have some tea? It's a bit cold."

Monica looked surprised at my words, then smiled brightly and nodded.

* * *

The New Year arrived.

Monica left for Paris again for work,

and I went to the training ground in Parma for training.

At the same time, there were players leaving our team.

First, Valentin Mihaila left for Borussia Mönchengladbach,

leaving a fairly large transfer fee of 10.5 billion won for the club.

Since Santiago and I were often used as starting wingers, his playing time decreased,

so it seemed he left the team this winter because of that.

He's a good player, so he will probably achieve good results in Germany as well.

Next, a veteran left.

The 37-year-old veteran Adilu left for San Lorenzo in the Argentine league, leaving a transfer fee of 500 million won.

I heard that he plans to retire there,

and he wanted to play many games as a starter until retirement, which is why he transferred.

Lautaro Valencia, who relied on him a lot, was very disappointed.

Santiago told me that Lautaro was so depressed for a few days after Adilu left.

But after the vacation ended and Lautaro started participating in training again, he returned as the leader of Parma's defense.

There are also transfer offers for Yann Karamoh,

but I heard that the talks about his transfer are quite drawn out and may only be completed near the end of the transfer window.

Anyway,

while there are those who left,

there were also new friends joining the team.

Czech player Rodiklav Kresic from the Russian league joined the team as a backup winger.

The transfer fee was about 4 billion won,

and contrary to the cheap price, his skills were quite excellent.

Even Santiago, who always slacked off, got so nervous that he consistently joined me for night training for about a week.

He was an experienced player with many strengths.

The problem was that he couldn't speak Italian,

but fortunately, he was quite good at English, so he mainly communicated with other players through me.

I'm sure he will adapt quickly.

I was practically serving as a translator for Korean, English, and Italian while being a football player.

Shouldn't I get an extra translation allowance for this?

Lastly, Fabio Cucciola, who joined the first team from the reserve team, filled the vacancy left by Adilu.

The 18-year-old with a stern face was considered quite cute by the veterans,

but Fabio seemed even more nervous.

Well... Seeing legends like Giovanni Buffon and Gianluca Inglese in person, it would be strange not to be nervous.

But,

why does this guy blush when he looks at me?

I'm not a f*cking racist,

and I want to make it clear that I'm not a homophobe either.

But a guy blushing while looking at me gave me chills.

I won't be showering with him.

Anyway,

as we entered January, each club was working hard to fill their lacking players,

and finally, my contract renewal was confirmed.

The contract period is 3 years,

with the third-highest weekly salary in the team.

And there are several bonus clauses and a release clause.

Leo, who brought me more than I expected, said he would find me a better team with better conditions in the summer.

The release clause amount is about 27 billion won, which I thought was quite high,

but later, our manager sighed and said, "I don't even want to sell you for double that amount... Your agent is a devil!" while sighing.

I was amazed to see that news about my transfer stopped as soon as I renewed my contract.

Santiago said my agent seemed more competent than he thought and asked me to introduce him later.

Anyway,

the break passed very quickly.

Maybe because there were so many things going on.

I confessed to Monica,

trained and improved my hold-up play, which is known as "backing and sticking,"

and lastly, I corrected the habit of using my left foot as a pivot while dribbling.

Honestly, I didn't think I could achieve all this in such a short time,

but I adapted better than I thought.

Even Matteo, the head coach, was amazed at my changed appearance and asked if I was a game character.

Time flew by, and mid-January approached.

The break was ending,

and it meant that the second half of the league was starting.

The first match of the second half was against Como, the 14th place team in the league, followed by the 3rd round of the Coppa Italia.

Yes, it meant that Como was the best practice opponent to check what we had prepared before facing AS Roma.

Franco would drop to the 3rd line,

I would be on the right,

Denis Man would take the left,

and finally, Santiago would be in the center of the second line, giving freedom to Franco, who struggled with strong pressing and tackling in the second line.

In training, this influence was evident, and we won 11-0 against the reserve team.

4 goals and 4 assists.

This was my record alone in the first half.

Playing on the right side like Mandzukic, I felt like I was completely dominating the flank.

After finishing all the checks, we left for Como in the Lombardy region, famous for Lake Como.

I booked a hotel and briefly texted Monica,

who said she was dying from a lot of work lately.

Maybe because of that, her voice sounded very down.

Feeling sorry for her, I wanted to do something,

and Monica asked me to score a cool goal this time.

A cool goal...

Since it's a request from Monica, I have to fulfill it.

Looking around YouTube, I saw a scene that caught my eye.

* * *

January 16th.

The opponent was Como 1907.

A lower-ranked team in 14th place in the league,

they favored the 4-2-3-1 formation like AS Roma,

and my opponent, Nizar Vignali, had a similar play style to AS Roma's Matías Viña.

It was like meeting the best opponent in the league to check our tactics before the match against AS Roma.

The break, which felt short and long at the same time, ended,

and maybe because it was a match after a long time, the stands at Como's home stadium, Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia, were packed.

"The opponent is the team we crushed in the first match of the first half."

"Show them an amazing game."

"And bring home the first victory of the second half, just like in the first half."

Not many words were needed.

Just like our manager said, if we show an amazing game and bring home the victory,

we are the undefeated champions of the first half.

That's Parma Calcio.

Talking like this made me feel proud.

As we entered the field, the crowd cheered.

Well, it's a match after a long time, isn't it?

Having rested for almost a month,

it meant that Italian football fans who enjoy Serie A hadn't watched football for a month.

The opponent prepared their tactics as we expected,

and the composition of their players was as expected.

On the other hand, the opponent seemed surprised to see us.

Seeing Franco placed at the 3rd line and Santiago placed in the center of the 2nd line,

they looked puzzled.

The referee blew the whistle,

and the first match of the second half finally began.

Parma moved as we had prepared,

and Como, seeing us suddenly drop back, showed a moment of bewilderment.

Originally, we pressured the opponent with forward pressing and high activity, but suddenly dropping back,

it was enough to bewilder them.

Como's players moved the ball around to gauge the situation,

but seeing our tightly packed defense, they seemed frustrated and connected a long pass to the flank.

We quickly intercepted that pass.

It was a rather careless pass.

As things weren't going well, they tried a long pass,

and they couldn't have imagined that this careless pass would become an arrow to shake Como's left flank.

Parma intercepted the ball and connected it to the center.

Franco, placed at the 3rd line, calmly received the ball,

and seeing me move deeply to the flank, made a long, high, and fast pass in my direction.

It was clear that my opponent, Nizar Vignali, would be flustered, having to compete with me in both speed and height.

I took my position, jumped high, and received the ball on my chest.

Then, turning my back, I bumped and nudged.

As soon as I did this, Nizar stumbled and fell.

Was I always this good at body contact?

I don't think so.

Balancing myself, I quickly passed to the center, and Santiago immediately took a shot.

Thunk!

The ball hit the goalpost and went over.

Our first attack ended with a goal kick.

The opponent seemed completely unprepared for our changed attack pattern and couldn't respond properly.

* * *

-Goal!

-Gennaro Tatis scores! Minho drops it! Franco Vazquez makes a clean pass after receiving the ball! And Gennaro Tatis finishes with a turning shot!

-It was a perfect combination. The movement of the three players was very precise!

The first goal was scored in the 21st minute of the first half.

Franco, who received the ball I connected from the flank, turned around and made a clean connection to the penetrating Gennaro,

and Gennaro, who received it, perfectly finished with a turning shot, securing the first point.

The focal point of the match was Franco and me,

with Franco holding the ball in the center and making high, fast passes to the flank, where I contested and controlled the ball,

and based on that, other attackers penetrated and developed the attack. This was our first plan.

But one pattern would eventually be blocked.

As the opponent targeted Franco, who was relaxed under pressure, the number of passes coming to me decreased,

and at the same time, our attack slightly entered a lull.

"Minho!"

This is when a crack is needed.

Honestly, I can't show an amazing performance like Messi or other great players,

but at least among Parma's players, I think I fit this role the best.

Well... it wasn't like that before.

Monica told me to have confidence,

and looking at my performance, I gained a small "conviction."

At least about the talent I have as a player.

Of course, I still had a lot of worries.

What if my talent was just a "fluke"?

But Monica said,

Why be scared of such a thing?

What if it’s a fluke?

What I have built up until now isn't a lie, so don't be too scared.

Acknowledge the skills you have now, have confidence, and enjoy playing football.

When did I start getting scared?

Oh, I remember.

Baek Seunghoon, who went to the same middle school, said that.

A friend who received a lot of attention as the Korean Messi.

He always told me,

If I pass like that, it would be hard for him to receive.

If I move like that, the team would suffer.

He always told me to move for the team.

That if the team loses because of my mistake,

it's not being creative, it's just selfishness.

Thinking about it now, wasn't that gaslighting?

That friend would always whine, asking if I couldn't sacrifice for the team if I took a bit of personal movement.

But now that I think about it, in most of the matches where the team lost, Baek Seunghoon had more turnovers than I did.

Yeah, throughout middle school life,

that friend, drunk on the title of Korean Messi, showed off personal skills,

and my teammates and I cleaned up his mistakes.

Of course, things changed in high school.

The best genius in Korea became just another winger.

I might have been scared seeing him fall after shining brightly in middle school.

A few days ago, I heard that Baek Seunghoon went down to the provinces and opened a mackerel set menu restaurant.

I felt a strange emotion,

so I confided this to Monica.

This happened,

and I don't know what to do.

She gave me a wise answer.

Don't care about that bastard and kiss me first.

Monica was indeed wise.

-Minho! He takes the ball and moves slowly.

-Minho suddenly accelerates!

Anyway,

the field looked wider than usual today.

And the players' movements, which were hard to grasp, were clear to see.

It finally felt like I was truly on the field.

-Minho! Easily passes one and quickly breaks through the flank! He's so fast!

-Minho is the key point of the counterattack!

Parma's players rush to the center.

And following them, Como's defenders also move, which I could see clearly.

If I cross as we had promised here, Gennaro will likely win the ball.

But this time, I saw a different path.

I easily passed a midfielder who hurriedly blocked my way.

The opponent was bewildered as it was the first time they saw me use a flip-flap, losing balance.

-Minho’s flip-flap!

-Passes one in an instant!

Next was a step-over.

Well, the trick we know as the stepover.

Wow!

Cheers erupted from the away stands.

I passed two players,

and accelerated again, breaking into the center.

-Minho! Reaches the half-space!

-It's here where Minho often produces goals with his left-footed curlers! Parma fans call this the "Minho Zone!"

The opponent would know well that I often make left-footed curlers from the half-space.

Two defenders were deployed to block the shot,

and I attempted another dribble instead of a shot.

Quickly reducing speed,

I changed direction and did a scoop turn.

In an instant, the two defenders tangled and opened up space.

I broke into that space,

and dodged the goalkeeper who rushed out to narrow the shooting angle, sharply slotting the ball into the empty net from a tight angle.

Thwack!

-Goal! Minhooo! An amazing goal! Minho scores with his individual skill! Incredible! Simply incredible! It's a fantastic goal!

-The score is now 2-0! This goal has put Como in a crisis in an instant!

I scored and ran towards the broadcast camera.

And conveyed my thanks to Monica, who would be watching me now.

In other words,

I sent a finger heart.

This is a bit embarrassing.

* * *

José Mourinho.

Currently the manager of AS Roma,

he is a renowned manager who led Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan, and Real Madrid to multiple trophies.

In an interview, he said he wasn't worried at all about facing Parma Calcio in the 3rd round of the Coppa Italia,

but in fact, he was more cautious about them than any other team.

He had a particular interest in one player,

who played like Arjen Robben,

scored like Thierry Henry,

dribbled like Ronaldo,

and linked up like Benzema.

Conversely, despite his immense talent, he revealed a significant weakness in creativity and application.

So he judged that this player could be sufficiently targeted.

This was Mourinho’s evaluation of Park Minho.

But not anymore.

Watching Parma’s match against Como, Mourinho frowned.

At the same time, he reprimanded his past self for making such an evaluation.

"What? Arjen Robben? Thierry Henry? Ronaldo? Benzema?"

No.

The sight of Park Minho showing an incredible dribble against Como didn’t remind him of them.

“What on earth did Parma’s manager do to change this player like that?”

That was...

Yes, that was a monster.

Though the play style was different,

he felt the essence of one player who played for Barcelona.

The player who has now become a god.

He felt that essence from that Asian player.

Mourinho felt his chest tighten.

He probably needed some antacids.
