"Uh?"

Somehow, my wrist feels empty.

The sleeves of my school uniform, which fit perfectly before, have become loose. This is the moment where choosing milk over juice pays off. Even a tiny bit of progress was good. After all, there's a saying that little drops of water make a mighty ocean.

"Hyun!"

When I went downstairs for breakfast, Dr. Tikhonov greeted me enthusiastically, wearing an apron. It was a sight I had become accustomed to.

My mother and the housekeeper liked the good-natured Dr. Tikhonov. He approached cooking with the same fierce concentration as he did his chemical research.

"Boss, I made doenjang jjigae (soybean paste stew) and stir-fried pork for breakfast today."

Anyone would think he was a chef on a reality show being judged. And my grandfather would be the notorious judge.

Dr. Tikhonov's face showed obvious signs of tension. I thought he was someone who had eliminated the DNA for nervousness, but apparently not.

When my grandfather slowly took a big spoonful of the doenjang jjigae, Dr. Tikhonov's Adam's apple bobbed significantly.

"Mm, it's very delicious, Doctor."

It really was. The color, the savory smell, and the taste that elicited admiration. Someone who didn't know better would think it was made by an elderly grandmother with gray hair.

Dr. Tikhonov clenched his fists in a gesture of triumph.

"By the way, Hyun, what time is your graduation ceremony today?"

"At 1 PM, Grandfather."

"Alright, we'll all go together, including Mr. Kim and the housekeeper."

It seemed like a large family was going to move. In my past life, my mother had attended my middle school graduation alone because my father's laundry business was busy. At that time,

"Boss, may I also attend Hyun's graduation ceremony?"

"Of course, I'd be grateful if you came, Doctor."

So even Dr. Tikhonov was coming to the graduation ceremony. I just hoped he wouldn't prepare an overly extravagant bouquet.

However, contrary to my wish, Dr. Tikhonov's face already showed signs of excitement. If someone who didn't know better saw him, they might mistake him for the one graduating.

"Hyun, you're giving the graduation speech as the representative, right?"

"Yes, Grandfather."

"Have you prepared your speech well?"

Of course, in my past life, I had prepared so much for speeches and addresses that I was used to it. During my time at the Judicial Research and Training Institute, I had stood on the podium countless times as the representative of the trainees.

Thankfully, the auditorium of Jeil Middle School was spacious. Six people from my family alone were attending.

"By the way, Yooha's grandfather said he would also come to congratulate you on your graduation."

"Yooha's grandfather?"

"Yes, he said he must attend your graduation and has been talking about it for days. It seems like Im Hyera will also come."

Figures you would see in an economic weekly magazine were gathering. I never imagined that a prominent figure in the business world would attend my graduation ceremony.

I had a feeling the principal might be more nervous than I was.

"Maestro Spencer?"

Yuri couldn't believe her eyes. She encountered a familiar figure in the hotel lobby.

"Long time no see, Maestro Yuri."

"What brings you here? I thought you were in London for a royal performance."

"The performance ended last week. I came back to Korea for a brief matter. Our prospective member is graduating today."

Yuri's eyebrows shot up at the word "member." But Spencer was no pushover either.

The hotel manager was at a loss for what to do with the presence of the two foreigners, whose auras were extraordinary, making it feel like witnessing a fierce duel.

"I'm here for the same reason. My first student is graduating today. What a coincidence."

"Maestro Yuri, did you say student?"

Spencer asked again, his eyes wide open. Yuri's expression turned triumphant. After all, it wasn't strange to refer to Kang Hyun as a student since he had taught him something.

"Even though we have a teacher-student relationship, it doesn't influence the decision to join an orchestra. As you know, I was also taught in Vienna but am now in London. Even the eternal Maestro Gustav said that choosing an orchestra is like dressing the soul of a musician. We'll have to see which outfit fits best."

The manager's expression grew increasingly uneasy. The well-dressed, elderly foreigners exuded an immense aura.

Their voices were quiet, but their conversation was intense, almost as if they were about to fight. It felt like witnessing a noble argument from the past.

At that moment,

"It seems we've attracted some attention. I'll excuse myself first, Maestro Spencer."

Just as Yuri was about to turn away politely,

"Maestro Yuri, may I ask you one last thing?"

"Of course."

"What did you teach your student?"

Spencer still appeared puzzled. That was understandable since he knew the student better than anyone.

Yuri then showed a faint smile, like a lion baring its fangs.

"Conducting."

Clap!

At the sound of clapping, the members' eyes focused all at once. Their eyes were all alive. They had been practicing tirelessly throughout the winter break.

These were kids who had never prepared for an orchestra before. Initially, their music was disjointed, but now their melodies fit together like cogs in a wheel.

The faces of the kids who had just finished the final rehearsal were mixed with tension and excitement.

"I've collaborated with countless orchestras. But you all have the most passionate hope I've ever seen. Let's showcase that hope to your parents today."

In fact, I've only collaborated with the London and Belgian Symphony Orchestras, both of which are among the world's best.

Of course, the students' skills couldn't be compared to theirs, but this was the time to boost morale.

"Hyun, do you have a moment?"

It was Jin-ho, who was the concertmaster. He had been seriously discussing with the string section members just a moment ago. He had to decide the direction of the bow and the mood of the melody, so his responsibility was enormous. However, in front of me, he couldn't hide his tension.

"Can you check my posture again?"

"Sure."

Maybe it was because of the Baek Jung-hoon's Spartan training. Jin-ho was now able to play the solo part quite satisfactorily.

The problem was, he still didn't trust himself.

"Jin-ho, you're doing great. So, why are you so anxious?"

"My parents are coming today. My father doesn't like me doing music, and he doesn't even know about the performance."

He was still a young boy growing up under his parents. At times like this, I, as the senior, needed to give him confidence. I felt like a homeroom teacher.

"Don't worry. After watching today's performance, your father won't be able to help but approve. Jin-ho, you once told me your dream was to become an excellent violinist and join the Berlin Philharmonic, right? Even the Maestro of the Berlin Philharmonic would praise you after seeing today's performance. He'd say you're an excellent concertmaster."

"Thanks for saying that, Hyun."

"I'm not joking."

Indeed, I was confident I could amaze the Maestro.

"Now, we will have a speech by Kang Hyun from Class 7, the representative of the graduates. Everyone, please remain quiet."

In this life, I had held the microphone unusually often.

When I went up to the podium, I saw the graduates and numerous parents. There were so many people that it would have been impossible to accommodate them if it weren't for the large auditorium of Jeil Middle School.

Among them, my grandfather and the old serpent's figures stood out prominently.

Meanwhile, beads of cold sweat were forming on the forehead of the principal, who was seated in the front row.

Tap tap.

I tested the microphone by tapping it twice and then lowered it to match my height.

"First, I would like to thank the teachers and classmates who entrusted me with the honor of being the representative of the graduates. They say an end is also a beginning. To the juniors who gave the farewell address for the departing graduates, and to the friends who are now facing a new beginning, I would like to say one thing. Do not be afraid of failure."

In a way, it was a message to everyone present in the auditorium.

Although not now, this phrase would often be quoted in congratulatory speeches by famous people in the future.

"I believe that not even attempting out of fear of failure is a failure in itself. They say spring comes only after a harsh winter. None of us knows which season we are in right now. As you leave middle school and start a new beginning in high school, take on challenges without hesitation for your future. If Columbus had not dared to venture out of fear of failure, the New World would not have been discovered. Sometimes there will be fierce waves, and sometimes you will sail through calm waters. But remember this: you are the captain of the ship navigating the sea of life. That is all."

I thought it would be better to give realistic advice rather than an emotionally moving speech that would turn the place into a sea of tears.

However, after I finished my speech, the audience was too quiet. It was as if they were enveloped in silence.

I wondered if the topic was too heavy.

Clap!

With the sound of applause, people began to stand up. Soon, the sound of clapping like a wave enveloped my entire body.

* * *

'Don't be nervous.'

I suddenly realized when I stood on the conductor's podium. What I was looking at were not the audience but the eyes of the members.

It felt like I was a general standing at the forefront of a battlefield. I made eye contact with each member who had finished tuning.

I had to let them know. It was not them but the audience who should be nervous now.

Even though it was a small orchestra, the ensemble was well-coordinated. The murmuring audience became as quiet as a mouse at the serious expressions of the members.

I looked down at the concertmaster. The concertmaster, who made eye contact with me, tightly pursed his lips and nodded.

'Let's do this.'

As my hand slowly moved towards the air, the large instrument started to move.

Piano!

Following the sharp direction of my hand, the piano, responsible for the arpeggio and accompaniment, began to play the keys.

The importance of a conductor lies in controlling the tempo.

So, can't a metronome do that? No, the direction of the melody also unfolds from the fingertips of the conductor. Doesn't it look like the giant instrument is moving with emotion?

Starting with a lyrical introduction, the serene sound of a lakeside continued.

The members, who had swallowed their nerves, were now engrossed in the performance.

A concert of pure, clear notes. In the midst of the slow, song-like melody, the concertmaster's solo part began.

The posture and stance were perfect. The movement of the left hand pressing the strings was beautiful. The graceful melody, as if enchanting, signaled the end.

At that moment,

Dududung!

A powerful sound reminiscent of Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony struck the ears.

Beautiful flowers do not bloom easily. The hand cutting through the air became sharper.

The eyes of the members, filled with tension and excitement, were brimming with joy. They were all playing the strings, watching my fingertips.

Like buds striving to bloom, the melodies vied to tickle the ears.

Zing.

The deep sound of the cello melted the frozen melody. As the finale approached, my heartbeat quickened along with the movements of my fingertips.

The sheet music had no title. It was just a piece I wrote while watching the vigorously sprouting buds.

As we reached the finale, the foreheads of the members were covered in sweat. They were speeding up their fingers to match the last finale.

The members who made eye contact with me would have known. That they were doing very well.

As a conductor, I told the members with my fingertips. Prepare for the last resonance.

The vibrant melodies erupted as if they had been waiting.

The audience must have clenched their fists. And they would be amazed. Because at the end of the thrilling musical journey, there was a grand shout.

'Show everyone.'

At that moment, the signal from my fingertips caused the concertmaster's bow to swiftly glide over the strings.

Zing!

An incredibly smooth and refined resonance. The orchestra was saying. Finally, spring has come.
