- This is meaningful news. For the first time in Korean history, a musician has entered the Billboard singles chart. The musician is none other than violinist Kang Hyun. Kang Hyun previously garnered attention by taking on the role of music director for Hollywood director Jim Filmer's upcoming work 'Horror.' This time, he surprised even more by entering the top 30 of the Billboard chart. Let's hear the opinion of Kim Heunggu, president of the Korean Singers Association.

On the TV screen, Kim Heunggu, with a mustache, was being interviewed by an anchor.

The anchor's voice was clearly excited, having previously announced Kang Hyun's move to Hollywood.

However, the most excited person was none other than Kim Heunggu, president of the Korean Singers Association.

- Wow, this is really great news! In some ways, it's even more surprising than Kang Hyun becoming a music director in Hollywood. Until now, Koreans who made it onto the Billboard charts were either Korean Americans or Korean Japanese. Many even denied their Korean identity. The interesting part is that Kang Hyun entered the Billboard singles chart, not the classical chart!

- Is there a big difference between the classical chart and the singles chart?

- Of course, it's a huge difference. The classical chart is more like their own league, while the singles chart requires complete commercial appeal. It's not just about album sales; how often it is played on the radio and other media across the U.S. is also important. Moreover, it's classical music, not the currently trending pop or hip-hop in the U.S.

Kim Heunggu's characteristic excited gestures and voice made Yoo Hyunja's grip tighten as she watched the news.

Who would have thought she would hear about her son overseas on the nine o'clock news?

Yoo Hyunja was overwhelmed by the flood of phone calls these days.

"Honey, are you still getting a lot of calls these days?"

"Don't even mention it. It's even more than when Hyun won the competition before. Publishers are asking if I would consider writing a book on gifted education methods. I refused like last time, but they are so persistent. It's a relief if it's just phone calls. I went to the market to buy groceries, and I ran into a publisher's employee. It was so embarrassing I had to run away from the market."

"What did they say?"

"In front of everyone, they said that as the Shin Saimdang who raised a genius of this era, writing a book on gifted education methods would benefit all Korean parents. I was so embarrassed I ran out of the market."

Having a famous son had its downsides.

But never had she heard so many compliments about raising her child well as these days. She wondered if this is how the parents of sports stars Park Chan-ho and Park Se-ri felt.

Not only publishers but also broadcasters and newspapers were constantly requesting interviews.

If it weren't for Daeil Group's CEO Im Hyera blocking them, her mansion in Ichon-dong would have been surrounded by reporters by now.

She couldn't imagine how it would be if he became even more famous. But what parent would dislike their child's success?

- Kang Hyun's entry into the top 30 of the Billboard chart is already causing a huge stir in the U.S. Honestly, it might not feel as significant to the people in Korea, but it is truly astonishing.

- Are you kidding? No one has grown this rapidly on the Billboard singles chart with classical music. And look at Kang Hyun's popularity. His excellent performance skills and handsome appearance are making him popular even in the U.S. This is something even Seo Taiji couldn't do!

- Mr. Kim Heunggu, as the president of the Korean Singers Association, how difficult is it to enter the Billboard singles chart as a classical musician?

Yoo Hyunja couldn't hide her smile as she watched her son on the TV screen.

At that moment, Kim Heunggu, president of the Korean Singers Association, added in an excited voice as if to seal the deal.

- Classical music, even Mozart couldn't guarantee this!

"Cello, please pay a bit more attention."

The members of the New York Philharmonic were highly tense. Concertmaster Antonio was no exception.

Antonio wondered if Kang Hyun, who was watching the members with eagle eyes, was even human.

It was understandable because Kang Hyun did not tolerate any mistakes. He would detect even the slightest pitch deviation with ghostly precision.

"Sergey, loosen the pressure on your left index and ring fingers from the keyboard!"

Antonio looked at Sergey, the pianist from Russia.

Wasn't he a pianist renowned at the Chopin Competition from the Moscow Conservatory?

Known for his high self-esteem, he was as tense as a novice student learning the piano for the first time under Kang Hyun's strict guidance.

"Mind the tempo, Sergey. Don't rush too independently. Forte isn't the same as just any forte. Your fingers are too tense!"

Initially, Sergey wasn't this compliant. The other members were the same.

Kang Hyun's strict conducting style was different from other maestros. While many maestros would only give simple instructions considering the position of the concertmaster and principal, Kang Hyun would guide every minute detail.

Of course, the limited time left for the symphony recording was also a factor.

- I can't do this anymore!

Initially, Sergey had stood up from the piano chair, furious.

- Sergey, are you satisfied with your performance?

- I think there's nothing particularly wrong, but if I had known I would be collaborating under such a tyrant, I wouldn't have come. I trusted the reputation of the New York Philharmonic, but to be swayed by such a young conductor, what's wrong with everyone? Are you all out of your minds?

- Sergey, retract that statement immediately.

The fiery Russian seemed ready to pounce on Kang Hyun.

But the other members fully understood his feelings. They had also initially resisted Kang Hyun's conducting and guidance. However.

- I'll show you myself.

Kang Hyun sat down on the piano chair that Sergey had vacated and demonstrated the performance he had demanded.

Sergey, who had dedicated his life to the piano, was amazed by the superb performance and emotion.

It was as if veteran actors were performing method acting the moment the camera started rolling, overwhelming everyone present.

After several such occurrences, Sergey had no choice but to set aside his pride. He had already musically acknowledged Kang Hyun.

"Here, more softly yet strongly―!"

Though it was a paradoxical expression, Sergey couldn't argue. It aligned perfectly with the musical flow desired by the score.

Even after the Spartan-like rehearsal ended, neither Sergey nor the members could immediately stand up.

With a deep lingering emotion, sweat was already dripping down their backs.

Was all this difficult? Sergey could affirmatively say that this was the most cathartic performance he had ever collaborated on. It felt like he was delving into a completely new world of music.

"Then, let's take a thirty-minute break and start again."

Kang Hyun declared a short break and turned to leave the stage.

Now it was the time for the concertmaster, principal, and members. They needed to gather and discuss further.

"Isn't the conductor really cool?"

At a female member's words, everyone, regardless of age or gender, nodded. Sergey also unknowingly nodded.

Kang Hyun was not only exceptionally popular in the U.S. as a classical musician but had also entered the Billboard chart.

It wasn't just because he was tall and attractive for an Asian. His musical talent was so profound and vast that no one in the New York Philharmonic could measure it.

Furthermore, Kang Hyun felt like a musician and an architect. A musician who constructed his own world with the noble and beautiful melodies of orchestral instruments.

"Whew―!"

Kang Hyun exhaled the breath he had been holding and wiped the sweat from his forehead.

It was indeed a harsh rehearsal, almost like Spartan training.

If he had more time as usual, he wouldn't have pushed so hard. But his time in the U.S. was limited, and he had to take charge as a composer and conductor to complete the symphony within the period. By the way.

"I wonder how long these contacts will keep coming?"

Recently, many people had somehow obtained his number and were personally contacting him.

There were offers from broadcasting companies, CF proposals from companies, and even popular American singers and actors.

The most surprising was the approach from a famous American male actor. It seemed that popularity transcending gender could lead to such unfortunate events.

"Hyun, today is the first broadcast of the Ellen Show, right?"

At that moment, Antonio, the concertmaster who had entered the conducting room, subtly asked Kang Hyun. The date had already arrived.

Although less than a month had passed since the recording, ABA Broadcasting had decided on the first broadcast date sooner than planned. It meant they were very satisfied with the recording.

"Do you think the broadcast will come out well?"

"Well, I'm not sure. From an American perspective, I'm not sure if my appearance on a talk show would be entertaining..."

"Don't be silly. Do you know how popular you are in the U.S. right now? I've never seen my cousin's nephew buy a classical album before. Despite having an uncle who is the concertmaster of the New York Phil, he had no interest in classical music until he heard your performance and went to buy the album that day."

Kang Hyun wasn't confident about the Ellen Show's entertainment value.

Although he had watched the Ellen Show throughout his previous life, it was his first time appearing on a show, so he couldn't be sure how the atmosphere would turn out.

Furthermore, the outcome of the recording depended significantly on the power of editing.

"Hyun, why don't you consider staying in New York a bit longer? The maestro seems to want to see more of your conducting. It's too good to just record the movie's insert songs. How about holding an actual concert?"

"A concert?"

"It's not just my idea; the members and the maestro also agree. We wanted to ask you, but you've been too busy lately."

"I'll think about it in a positive direction."

He wanted to accept immediately, but he couldn't. The holidays at the Royal Academy of Music were ending.

Moreover, he had had a hard time dealing with the paparazzi in New York. If it weren't for Yooha and the New York Philharmonic, he would have left New York long ago.

"Thirty minutes are up. Let's get up."

"Already? Hyun, isn't the Ellen Show about to start?"

"Antonio, we can watch the rerun later. Right now, rehearsal comes first."

Antonio's face was full of regret. But Kang Hyun felt it was more important to practice even one more time right now.

Even if the Ellen Show aired, he wondered if anything would change.

However, Kang Hyun didn't realize that the first airing of the Ellen Show would make him even more famous.
