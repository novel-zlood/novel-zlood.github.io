짝짝짝짝―!
Thunderous applause and cheers reached the ceiling of the Berlin Philharmonic. The white-haired violinist in a red dress smiled brightly and bowed to the audience.
Everyone in the audience was captivated by the 'Joy' she held in her hands. The Berlin Philharmonic, who performed with her, must have felt the same.
Finally, the red dress fluttered like a rose as the queen of strings exited the stage. “I’m sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Tanaka.”
“No, ma’am. Today’s performance was truly the best.”
It was her first collaboration after a long rest. But it was hard to believe she hadn’t been on stage for a long time. It was as if she had been sharpening her skills even more.
“Performing with the Berlin Philharmonic will be an unforgettable memory in my life. They are always new and marvelous. The thrill I felt when I first performed with them decades ago still remains in my heart.”
“Ma’am, does that mean you consider the Berlin Philharmonic the best orchestra in the world?”
“Mr. Tanaka, you have a mischievous side. I always think the partner I’m collaborating with at that moment is the best in the world, whether it’s Vienna, London, or Berlin.”
Tanaka flipped through his notebook, as time was pressing.
“Ma’am, may I ask why you are urgently heading to Korea?”
No one expected Hirose to head to Korea after her performance.
“Mr. Tanaka, you asked me earlier where the best orchestra in the world is, right?”
“Yes, that’s correct.”
At that moment, Hirose took a sip of tea. The harmony of her red dress and white hair made it seem like a painting by a famous artist.
“I heard Yuri also chose to go to Korea.”
The emissary of the Berlin Philharmonic?
“I cannot judge where the best orchestra in the world is. But I do know the men who will become the world’s best violinist and pianist in the future.”
Just then, her manager, Goro, entered the waiting room. He held a passport in his hand. The queen of strings rose from her seat, leaving her final words to Tanaka.
“I’m going to meet them.”

Suddenly, the saying “a woman’s time flows quickly” came to mind.
Before I knew it, the child who was once a little girl was now acting like a young lady, wiping my forehead with a handkerchief and looking down at me with cat-like eyes.
It all felt like a scene from a movie.
- “See, oppa can’t do without me, can he?”
Even though I was clumsy in love, I knew that feeling. But it was an unreal situation for me. Comparing it to my previous life as the ice queen, it was unimaginable.
Wasn't she cold, proud, and unapproachable? It seemed even a rose-like girl like her was going through puberty. By the way.
When was my puberty?
“Kang Hyun?”
The staff's call shook me out of my thoughts. It seemed it was my turn now.
Thump thump thump.
Musicians who go on stage often say they feel like they’re burning under the sun with all the eyes on them.
No wonder some take herbal medicine and occasionally even collapse on stage.
Of course, thousands of heated eyes were fixed on me. It was the same now.
짝짝짝짝―!
Countless audiences welcomed me as I stepped onto the stage.
Feel like you’re burning? Come on, I’ve always felt this way, but I’m made for the stage.
Instead, the countless gazes, like intense spotlights, felt like rays of joy directed at me.
‘Handkerchief?’
At that moment, Baek Jung-hoon looked puzzled at the handkerchief tucked into my suit.
There was nothing during the rehearsal. But it wasn’t surprising. Some violinists sometimes wrap a handkerchief around the stand. Soon.
“Wow.”
When the Stradivarius ‘Fantasy’ appeared, there were exclamations from everywhere.
The bright red soundboard with black streaks looked like the shadow of dawn.
It was a masterpiece with a presence that could be felt even from afar. Its mere appearance captivated the audience.
For a moment, Baek Jung-hoon looked at me. Now, just by his eyes, I could tell what he meant. It was time.
The collaboration began with the lively sound of the piano.
As Baek Jung-hoon’s long fingers began to dance over the keys, everyone’s eyes were drawn to him as if by magic.
Indeed, a genius was a genius. Even simple notes contained indescribable emotions.
Sarasate, Carmen Fantasy.
A dark-colored handkerchief was placed on the chinrest. The silver strings gleamed as if they were about to burst into melody.
I slowly raised the bow. The moment the silver strings and the bow met, I would play with her.
Zing―!
It was a piece arranged for the violin from Bizet’s opera Carmen.
Baek Jung-hoon strongly recommended the piece. Although it was his solo concert, he said this collaboration was also for me.
As if to meet his expectations, I unfolded a splendid trill. It was a piece that required considerable skill.
From triple stops and double stops to arpeggios crossing the strings, and tremolos where the bow moved incessantly as if teasing the strings.
Baek Jung-hoon moved his fingers as if he was in a trance.
Even though he had already performed a solo, consuming a lot of emotions, he poured his feelings out as if it was the last performance of his life.
The notes on the staff seemed to come alive on his long fingers.
Harmonics, pizzicato, glissando, a continuous sequence of brilliant techniques.
But there wasn’t a single tremor in the melody.
The melody resonated like an unwavering star on black canvas, while the keys flowed gently like clouds, touching the heart.
Baek Jung-hoon must be reminiscing about that night, looking at the starry sky over the vast plains.
Zing―!
A high note soared as if it would pierce the ceiling of the Seoul Arts Center Concert Hall. The sharp bow mercilessly ravaged the silver strings.
As we raced towards the final movement, time seemed to stop as his fingers moved.
Though thick sweat beads formed on the handkerchief, the finale continued.
It didn’t matter if my fingers broke. It didn’t matter if I collapsed here. Baek Jung-hoon and I smiled as if we were showing the last finale of our lives.
Countless audiences were mesmerized by the collaboration of the two virtuosos. It was such a fantastic concerto that one might have doubted if they were dreaming.

“Mother, it’s so delicious―!”
I remember the appointment was in the afternoon.
“If I had known our Yooha liked braised ribs this much, I would have made it for you sooner. I’ll make more for you to take before you leave the country. And make sure to eat three meals a day, even when you’re studying abroad, okay?”
Of course, the heir of Daeil Group wouldn’t starve in a foreign country. Moreover, even Mother was now referring to Yooha as ‘our’ Yooha.
Son Yooha’s lips were smiling so wide they might have reached her ears. Her grandfather and father, watching her, were also beaming.
It seemed like everyone but me felt the same way.
“Yooha, but didn’t we agree to meet in the afternoon?”
Instead of answering my question, Son Yooha looked straight at Mother.
“Mother, Hyun oppa said we should meet at 2 PM. Not for lunch, but when the sun is at its peak. I wanted to see him since morning. I couldn’t wait any longer, so I came first.”
“Hoho, our Hyun is a bit shy. Yooha, you’ll have to work hard. Please take good care of our Hyun today.”
“Yes, Mother―!”
It was like watching a comedy duo, the way Mother and Son Yooha were in perfect sync. I thought she would just always shout, “Oppa―!”
Maybe it was because both Baek Jung-hoon and Yooha had been abroad; they seemed more playful. After finishing the meal, she even looked like she would help Mother with the dishes.
In the eyes of a mother without a daughter, Yooha seemed very lovable. But even though she seemed mature, she was still undeniably a young girl.
“Careless.”
I wiped the sauce off Son Yooha’s cheek with my hand. Her fair skin turned red as a ripe persimmon. Anyone would think she had applied blush.
For a moment, her grandfather looked at us with a pleased expression. However, his gaze was unusual. It felt like he was saying, “These kids are making a movie right here.”

“Kang Hyun, have a great time―!”
Was it my imagination, or did Mr. Kim’s laughter sound sinister?
The place where I arrived with Son Yooha was a nature park near Gyeonggi Province. It had a botanical garden, a zoo, and attractions, making it a paradise for students.
The important thing was that this amusement park was under Daeil Group.
“Oppa, let’s go!”
Like a triumphant general, Son Yooha led me into the amusement park. In my previous life, I had never visited such a place. I wasn’t interested in zoos, nor did I like riding attractions.
“Oppa, let’s ride that!”
Son Yooha had somehow reverted to her old self, gripping my arm tightly. We were now about the same height, so she no longer needed to hold onto my sleeve.
“You want to ride that?”
“Yeah, I’ve always wanted to try it.”
“Yooha, haven’t you been here often?”
Of course, she could use this vast amusement park for a whole day if she wanted. Moreover, the first ones to enjoy the new attractions at the park were always the children of the Daeil Group.
“Can’t we ride something else?”
“Please, oppa. I really need to ride that. It’s my first time.”
She was telling a lie that wouldn’t even fool a child.
There were bumper cars, a carousel, and even a Ferris wheel that offered a view of the sky. But of all the many rides, Son Yooha pointed to the Blue Dragon Roller Coaster.
Although it didn’t look particularly long, why did it make me so nervous?
“Huff, huff.”
I was more out of breath than when I played the violin all day. Instead of my arms trembling slightly, my legs were wobbly. Was it because my body was shorter?
Compared to the roller coasters of the future, the Blue Dragon Roller Coaster was tiny, but after riding it, I was drenched in a cold sweat.
“Next, let’s ride that!”
It seemed like Son Yooha was determined to kill me today. Her finger was now pointing at the Viking ride.
How many rides did we go on? It felt like we had ridden every single attraction in the park.
Thankfully, it was the 90s, so there was no Gyro Drop. If I wrote down the music ideas that were coming to mind, a terrifying score like Schubert’s Erlkönig would be born.
“Let’s take a break and have some ice cream, oppa.”
Thank goodness. If she had asked to ride another attraction, I might have run away right then and there.
As I licked a vanilla ice cream, feeling the cool summer breeze, I realized how quickly time had flown. It was already getting dark, making it clear why this place was called a paradise for students.
Just riding a few attractions made it evening.
Then.
“Excuse me, could you take a picture for us?”
Son Yooha handed a film camera to a passerby. I had no idea when she had prepared it.
As we posed in front of the fountain, ready to take a picture.
“Oppa.”
Peck.
Son Yooha’s white skin turned red like a ripe persimmon again. She seemed to have intended to kiss my cheek, but I turned my head at her call, and our lips accidentally met.
She tried to hide her embarrassment, but her expression was so cute.
“I, I’m your first, right?”
Yes, Yooha, you are my first.
