"Director Jean-Pierre wants me?" 

Director Im Hyera nodded briefly. I really didn't hear it wrong. It was so unbelievable that I was at a loss for words.

Director Jean-Pierre started with his debut film, "La Vie en Rose," which features a Jewish prodigy boy as the protagonist, and has been writing the history of French cinema ever since. His filmography has always been nominated for the Academy Awards, so there's no need to say more.

"Why, don't you like the movie's content? Jean-Pierre, though he hasn't made his own movie yet, is a very talented director. I guarantee how excellent his visual composition and aesthetic sense are. You know, I'm a painter, right?"

Of course, it couldn't be denied that Jean-Pierre would eventually become a representative director of France.

Regardless, even from my past life, I felt that Director Im Hyera had an outstanding eye for people. It might be that Son Yooha inherited her nature exactly, rather than that of Chairman Wang.

"I really like the movie's content. But I'm curious why Director Jean-Pierre specifically wants me. There are many outstanding violinists in France. Or he could ask a nearby European symphony orchestra."

In short, it doesn't make financial sense.

There were certainly renowned violinists in France. Although I became famous in Brussels, I couldn't compare to the reputation they had built.

Was it to save on guarantees? As if they knew how much I wanted. Moreover, they even suggested post-recording in Korea if necessary. It could end up costing more.

"Isn't the reason simple?"

"Pardon?"

Im Hyera poked at a part of the production plan with her long finger.

A Jewish prodigy boy.

"You're a prodigy violinist, Hyun."

She had a look on her face as if saying there's no need to say more. I barely held back from choking.

Im Hyera found my reaction quite adorable and gave a fresh smile as she stood up.

"Shall we discuss the details over brunch?"

How long had it been since I started work and she already wanted brunch? Even in my past life, I felt she was an unpredictable person. Sometimes, she would even have reports while dipping baguettes in butter.

Was it a mistake that old feelings from my time as the deputy head of the legal team at Daeil Group were resurfacing?

"Her tastes are consistent."

It was a French-style brunch galette made with a wide crepe, cheese, bacon, and a half-cooked egg. The yolk in the center acted as a sauce, making my mouth feel rich. It paired perfectly with lemonade.

It was a dish that would be delicious regardless of who made it, but since a professional chef made it, the taste was extraordinary.

"Did you learn how to eat galette from that French friend?"

I nodded awkwardly with bacon in my mouth. It was quite unnatural, but what could I do? I couldn't tell her that I studied how to eat French food in my past life to please her.

"Ms. Im, can I ask you a favor?"

"Hyun, just call me 'aunt.' Why 'Ms. Im'?"

It was awkward enough to call her Ms. Im, and she wanted me to call her 'aunt.' I pretended not to hear and looked at Director Im Hyera.

She considered meals as part of her business. She enjoyed dining with her business partners as well as her subordinates.

This might have been why she got along well with Chinese buyers.

"It's about my middle school admission. I have a lot I want to do in the future. But I think there will be problems if I transfer to a regular middle school. Public schools have complicated interests, so I won't be able to do what I want, and the school won't be able to take care of me properly. In the end, I need to go to a private school."

"Are you saying you want to transfer to a middle school under the Jeil Foundation?"

"Yes, if you could arrange that, I would positively consider doing simultaneous recording for Director Jean-Pierre's movie."

The middle and high schools under the Jeil Foundation were always in high demand, with almost no openings.

Of course, I could have asked my grandfather or Chairman Wang, and it would have been arranged immediately, but since Director Im Hyera was going to be the practical owner of the Jeil Foundation in the future, it was better to grease the wheels early to avoid trouble later on.

Trading the simultaneous recording of Director Jean-Pierre's film might seem arrogant, but knowing Director Im Hyera, it was different. 

"Even though you're young, you have quite the business acumen! How did you know I owe Jean-Pierre a favor?"

She would find this situation very amusing.

The uniform fabric of the middle school under the Jeil Foundation was exceptional. It felt smooth and clung to my skin.

My grandfather and parents were worried about me not transferring to an art middle school, but they gave up when I insisted I was fine.

After all, it was absurd to go to an art middle school to study music when I had received offers from the London Symphony, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the Queen of Strings.

"We're here, Kang Hyun."

The school I saw through the car window was magnificent. Even though it was the 90s, the facilities seemed to be running in the 21st century. There was a reason why the children of top domestic companies competed to enter Jeil Middle School.

Furthermore, the connections made here would have a significant impact on the future, so it was said that Jeil Middle and High School were harder to get into than Korea University.

A teacher greeted me at the school office after I was dropped off by Mr. Kim, the driver.

"Kang Hyun, you must have had a hard time coming from afar. I am Kim Kyuseong, the principal of Jeil Middle School."

This was a stark contrast to the treatment I received at Daeseong Middle School.

Even though I had won the youngest award at the Queen Elizabeth competition, it was likely that Im Hyera's influence played a bigger role here. They treated me so reverently that I almost felt burdened.

"Everyone, attention."

When I entered the assigned class with my homeroom teacher, all eyes were on me. They were all likely the children of well-known companies.

Their gazes were unusual. There were looks of admiration, but I also felt some jealousy.

Some girls looked at me with shining eyes, probably due to the media's influence.

Because of that, the expressions of the boys weren't very good. Boys will be boys, I guess. I suppressed a chuckle and greeted the students.

"Hyun, are you okay with taking the midterm exam on your first day of transfer?"

The homeroom teacher looked at me with a worried expression. It was just my luck that the transfer day I chose happened to be the start of the midterms. I could have postponed the transfer date with some maneuvering, but I didn't think of that.

"It's okay, I've been studying in my spare time."

When I took the exam at the previous middle school, I felt that my mind worked better than in my past life.

Although I never missed the top spot in any exam in the past, I was always nicknamed 'the study freak.'

Now, how should I explain it? It was like the computational speed and information processing capacity of a computer had increased.

Of course, it wasn't at a superhuman level, just enough to surprise others a bit. Thanks to that, subjects like Korean, English, and Math were a piece of cake.

And since I wasn't planning to take the bar exam in this life, it didn't matter. I just wished I could grow a bit faster.

Anyone hearing this might slap me for being so greedy, but this was my honest feeling. Finally, I turned the last page of the test paper.

My father's expression wasn't good since morning. I knew the reason. I had sneaked a look at the reports scattered on his desk last night. They were all research reports related to the new material 'graphene.'

Of course, I couldn't understand the chemical formulas, but there was a clear number that showed my father's worries.

The research cost was much higher than expected. My father, who was in charge of developing the new material, had no choice but to worry. Even if it succeeded, there was a question of whether there would be a place to use graphene.

"Father, we should try until the end. I don't know what it is, but cheer up. I'm here for you."

A man who draws his sword should at least cut a radish.

Moreover, graphene would be the lifeline for Dongju Chemical in the future. Its true value would be revealed eventually.

"I heard you said in the meeting that this is a chemical company, not a chemical factory?"

The rumor must have spread. My father patted my head and nodded vigorously.

"Yes, I can't be ignorant of something my son knows. I feel like I'm always learning from you, Hyun. Thank you. By the way, Hyun, aren't you going to school today? You're not in your uniform."

"I need to stop by the gallery in the morning, so I'll probably go to school in the afternoon. It's about the simultaneous recording of the music film I mentioned before."

The private middle school under the Jeil Foundation was indeed good. They were flexible with attendance due to my achievements.

My winning the youngest award at Queen Elizabeth had a significant impact. Moreover, my face was prominently featured in newspapers and news, so the school actively supported me under the pretext of student capability development.

Of course, Im Hyera's support made things even smoother.

"Thank you, sir."

"Not at all. These days, the elder looks much brighter thanks to you, Kang Hyun. I'll pick you up after lunch."

When I arrived at the gallery, a young female employee who had greeted me before welcomed me. She was very kind, probably because of the previous incident, but I still pretended not to know.

As I entered the office with a knock, I saw Im Hyera sitting opposite a foreigner.

"Hyun, you're early. If you keep coming early, this aunt will feel bad. By the way, say hello. This is Director Jean-Pierre, who flew from France to see you."

I never imagined that Director Jean-Pierre would visit Korea himself. I thought an assistant director or a sound director would come.

Jean-Pierre stood up and greeted me in English as I stood frozen.

"Nice to meet you, I'm Jean-Pierre. I've always wanted to meet you, Violinist Hyun."

"It's an honor. I'm Kang Hyun."

Im Hyera looked at me with a satisfied smile. Why did her gaze increasingly resemble that of Chairman Wang?

"Jean-Pierre, if you need more, have more. The chef's galette is truly fantastic."

As expected, the morning started with brunch. Of course, it wasn't just a meal but a place where the contract terms for simultaneous recording were discussed verbally. It seemed that Im Hyera had arranged this meeting as an intermediary.

I never imagined I would be in the position of the client in a contract arranged by Director Im Hyera.

"Hyun, I intend to set your guarantee at the same level as established violinists. Of course, I will strive to accommodate all your requirements."

It was a surprising offer. The bacon in my mouth tasted sweet.

Of course, I had no intention of asking for a higher guarantee. From the beginning, they had offered to set my guarantee at the level of established violinists. Furthermore, they promised to accommodate all my needs, an exceptional condition.

Normally, a contract negotiation would be filled with tension and subtle bargaining, but now it was all smiles.

Jean-Pierre was enthusiastically talking about the movie. This was his first commercial film proposal, not an independent film, so his affection for "La Vie en Rose" was special.

Moreover, it was more of a movie filled with the director's personal tastes rather than a complete commercial film. That's probably why it was always considered a masterpiece in the future.

"I'm really looking forward to the scene where the protagonist, Moses, plays the violin in the concentration camp. I can't wait for the day we shoot that scene. When Moses plays the violin, people inside the iron bars will eagerly watch. The melody of freedom blooming under oppression. Hyun, you must know the scene I'm talking about since you received the production plan."

Of course, it was a scene I liked very much. I watched it so many times that the videotape stretched. I even got scolded by the video store owner for it.

"Jean-Pierre, I'm also really looking forward to that scene. You're talking about the scene where he plays the violin with hand gestures, right? Where the people inside the iron bars and the protagonist create the melody with their whistles."

Jean-Pierre's expression changed instantly.

"What are you talking about, Hyun?"

Huh?

Seeing Jean-Pierre's puzzled look, I realized that the draft of the final scene of "La Vie en Rose" I knew was different.

The vague storyboard in the production plan was the problem. So naturally, I thought it was an invisible violin!

Although I quickly composed myself, Jean-Pierre was already staring at me. His gaze was so intense it made my throat dry.

As I picked up a glass of water to moisten my throat and pondered, Jean-Pierre suddenly exclaimed.

"Yes! Now that I think about it, playing an invisible violin with hands longing for freedom is better than playing an old violin. Why didn't I think of that before!"

What?

"After all, everyone inside the concentration camp had a violin in their hearts. The final melody of freedom should be replaced by their whistles!"

At that moment, Jean-Pierre, with a look of realization, hugged me tightly, his face filled with emotion.
