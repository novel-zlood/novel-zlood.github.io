"That kid, really."

Kang Hyun looked down at Yooha, who had fallen asleep on the bed. She seemed quite tired from waiting for him alone at the movie theater.

Kang Hyun patted Yooha's head once and covered her up to her shoulders with a blanket to prevent her from catching a cold. In his heart, he wanted to lie down next to her, but what could he do?

Not only did he smell of alcohol, but Yooha was still a high school student. Sharing a bed with her could only be described as a crime.

"Oppa, mmnyaa..."

At that moment, Yooha, as if talking in her sleep, called out to Kang Hyun in the air. Her baby-like gestures were so cute that Kang Hyun patted Son Yooha's head once more and then moved away.

On the table, scripts were still piled up like a mountain. Some of them inspired him just by looking at the beginning, while others gave him no feeling at all.

"Just worrying about it won't give you any answers."

Wasn't that a saying he learned while working as a prosecutor at the Western District Prosecutors' Office? Unnecessary worries only produce useless concerns, so it's best to do what your body wants. Kang Hyun began to draw the inspirations that came to him directly onto the sheet music.

Jim Filmer's script was a horror and thriller. Even the inspirations were as sharp as a midsummer moonlight.

Shwing.

A melody that sounded like a blade slicing through echoed naturally in his mind. Just looking at the script inspired him this much; facing it on screen would be even more astonishing.

It was a movie he'd never seen in his past life. Although he was familiar with Jim Filmer's filmography, there was certainly no movie with such a storyline.

How much time had passed?

Sunlight poured through the window of the hotel room. Son Yooha, who was sound asleep on the bed, rubbed her eyes against the warm sunlight and got up. Realizing the empty spot next to her, she immediately looked around for Kang Hyun.

"Oppa?"

Kang Hyun was sleeping on a chair with the table as his pillow. The table was cluttered with scripts and sheet music.

Not knowing when he fell asleep, he was holding the sheet music and a pen tightly. Yooha carefully brought a chair and sat next to Kang Hyun.

"How can he be so handsome?"

Yooha examined Kang Hyun's features closely.

The boy she met at her grandfather's house when she was young had become a young man. The mysterious boy who had captivated Yooha's eyes from their first meeting still made her heart flutter intensely now that he had grown up.

Yooha gently ran her long fingers through Kang Hyun's hair.

As the skin hidden under his bangs was exposed to the sunlight, Kang Hyun tightly shut his eyes.

Finding this cute, Yooha smiled and carefully brought her lips to Kang Hyun's forehead.

Smooch.

With a refreshing sound, Yooha looked at Kang Hyun and laid her head on the table to sleep.

Only the warm sunlight was watching the two beautiful young people.

"How was the movie?"

At Kang Hyun's question, Son Yooha showed a happy expression. It was because they could finally have the movie theater date they couldn't have a week ago.

The movie they watched together was "The Perfect Storm," released in 2000. In his past life, he hadn't been able to watch it because he was busy preparing for the bar exam, but seeing it directly on Broadway in New York was incredible!

"It was great being with you, Oppa!"

For Yooha, the movie's content didn't seem to matter. She seemed happy just to walk around Broadway with Kang Hyun.

"Shall we go for dinner then?"

Kang Hyun had never been on a proper date in his past life either. When he was young, he was called a workaholic, studying constantly for success.

Even his marriage, a major life event, was like being sold off to a politician's family for ambition. Naturally, the woman he married never treated him like a husband and lived a thoroughly show-window marriage. Then.

"Hey, should I buy that for you?"

Kang Hyun pointed to a hairpin being sold at a roadside stall on Broadway and asked Yooha.

"The one I gave you before is quite old now."

"Then I'll wear this one and the one Oppa gave me before alternately."

It was a cubic-studded hairpin that cost no more than ten dollars, but Yooha looked as happy as if she had received a diamond.

After giving her the hairpin, they headed to the restaurant they had reserved. It was the restaurant Vermia, which they had visited before.

"Hyun, welcome."

When Kang Hyun arrived, the chef personally came out to greet him. Although he hadn't known it before, he had heard a lot about the chef's reputation at social gatherings of film directors.

This chef was known to be exceptionally picky, even among famous chefs.

No matter how famous a person was, if the chef didn't like them, he would never show his face. But how about in front of Kang Hyun?

"The state of the fresh meat we received today is excellent. I would like to offer you some well-aged red wine as a service, but unfortunately, I can't do that because of the young lady's age. However, if Hyun wants to enjoy it, please let the manager know anytime. It's a red wine I personally keep."

The chef smiled as if he had met his first love.

The usually disciplined managers were treating them with utmost caution, as if they were VIPs.

Kang Hyun thought he should personally invite the Vermia chef if he ever held a concert in the United States.

While they were enjoying a delicious dinner.

"Yooha, is there something you want to say?"

Maybe because he had known Son Yooha for a long time, Kang Hyun could tell what she was thinking just by looking at her face.

At Kang Hyun's question, Yooha hesitated for a moment, then nodded and spoke. After listening to Yooha's story for a while, Kang Hyun asked curiously.

"You want me to come to your school?"

"Yes, I talked about Oppa at school, and somehow the teachers found out..."

Yooha lowered her head as if she were a criminal.

Listening to the story, Kang Hyun could understand the situation in detail. Yooha's close friend Michelle had talked about Kang Hyun at school, and the students found out.

Given that Kang Hyun was gaining popularity as a classical idol, the interest was understandable.

Eventually, even the principal asked if they could invite the violinist Hyun to the school.

'By principle.'

Kang Hyun hated troublesome things. By principle, he would have told them to talk to his agency or outright refused.

But this was Yooha's matter. Yooha hadn't mentioned it with bad intentions; it was just a child's pride leading to a rumor.

"Alright, Oppa will go."

At that moment, Yooha's eyes sparkled.

'A meeting with Director Jim Filmer will be in a week...'

Kang Hyun began composing the insertion song related to Jim Filmer's script first. There was no particular reason; it was just that the inspiration came most easily from that script.

What was problematic was Director James Cameron, who had sent him a rather enthusiastic love call.

"Hmm."

He liked the script. However, he was worried about affecting James Cameron's filmography. After all, he had never acted before.

Moreover, although it was a musical film, it also included a poignant romance. There were even intense kiss scenes with the female lead, which would make Yooha furious if she saw it.

By the way.

'What can I do at school?'

It wasn't just any middle or high school; it was a prestigious high school known even in New York. It was said that not only the children of well-known conglomerates but also those of prominent politicians attended this school. There wasn't much Kang Hyun could do for them.

The school expressed that they wanted Kang Hyun to give a lecture to the students in the auditorium.

Kang Hyun had attended lectures by famous people before. Geniuses who made a mark in the IT industry would talk to budding students about their lives and values to help them solidify their life's direction. But.

'That I would be giving such a lecture.'

On the surface, he was just a young man of twenty. Even if the high school students were minors, they weren't much younger than Kang Hyun. What kind of advice could he give them?

Moreover, they weren't even music students, making it difficult to contribute musically. However, Yooha seemed unconcerned about Kang Hyun's worries.

"Oppa, you'll do great."

"Yooha, do you think your friends will welcome me?"

At that moment, Michelle, the Black girl sitting in the back seat of the car with Yooha, waved her hand as if to say not to worry.

"Oppa, don't worry too much. The girls at our school love you. You're even more popular than Matthew, the vocalist of the Iris band!"

Somehow, Kang Hyun felt sorry for Matthew. And Michelle kept glancing at Kang Hyun's face as if she found it fascinating.

"Mr. Kang Hyun, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Jameson, the principal of Phillips!"

The principal, with a bulging belly, rushed out to greet Kang Hyun. Not just the principal, but other teachers were also there.

The principal revealed himself to be a fervent fan of Kang Hyun and kept expressing his gratitude for coming today. He kept talking to Kang Hyun so much that it seemed his mouth had no time to rest.

Kang Hyun wondered if he was usually such a talkative person, but Michelle, who was walking alongside them, whispered to Yooha, "It's my first time seeing the principal talk this much."

"The students are waiting in the main auditorium."

"The main auditorium?"

"Yes, we announced via school broadcast that students from any grade could attend your lecture if they wanted to. The other teachers who couldn't come out to greet you are also in the main auditorium, putting aside their afternoon classes to be there. They need to manage the large number of students for safety."

Just how many people were gathered for him to say this? As they approached the main auditorium, the murmurs of the students could be heard through the walls.

Kang Hyun couldn't help but smile. Since when had it been like this? He felt both nervous and excited at the same time. It seemed to be a side effect of having performed on stage too many times.

Thud.

After parting with Yooha and climbing onto the podium with the principal.

Wowww―!

The moment Kang Hyun appeared, a tremendous cheer erupted, almost shaking the main auditorium. The female students screamed in excitement as they looked at Kang Hyun.

As Michelle had said, it seemed it wasn't a lie that Kang Hyun was more popular among the students than Iris's Matthew.

Facing the eyes of numerous students, Kang Hyun smiled once again. Now, it was his turn to boost Yooha’s confidence.
