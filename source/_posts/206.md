Damn it!

A large hand grasped fiercely. Eyes resembling a tiger's were creating waves of emotional turmoil.

At that moment, Son Gangwook's brow furrowed roughly as if possessed by a malevolent spirit.

"What on earth!"

He couldn't understand. Wasn't everything proceeding smoothly as if sails were set in a favorable wind?

Not only had he managed to put his absolute father in bed, but also to oust the eldest son, Son Ilsung, from Jeil Electronics.

He even felt as if everything was unfolding according to divine will. However...

"Who the hell is that old manâ€•!"

The secretary tightly closed his eyes. Son Gangwook was someone who rarely expressed his emotions outwardly. But now, wasn't his face turning red and blue as if he would throw his nameplate any moment?

The reason he was so agitated was simple. It was because of the new chairman of Jeil Group who had appeared out of nowhere.

"Sir, from our urgent investigation, it appears that he was a farmer in Jirisan. His name is Kim Deoksu, and he is currently ninety-seven years old, almost a centenarian. It was revealed that the chairman contacted him three years ago."

"Three years ago?"

"Yes, sir."

It was absurd. Wasn't three years ago when South Korea was bustling with the financial crisis?

Does that mean he had been transferring shares to an unknown third party since then?

But that wasn't the only thing he couldn't understand. Even the elders of Jeil Group, known for their high noses, were inexplicably respectful to the old man, as if treating their own father.

"Is there a way to win him over?"

"At this point, it's hard to find a connection. The person seems to be deliberately avoiding meeting with our side, possibly because the chairman had prepared him. However, there are already many rumors among the executives and affiliate presidents."

"Of course, it's because there's never been a case where an unrelated third party suddenly becomes chairman of Jeil Group. Moreover, that person is an old man who is about to close the coffin."

He wasn't wrong. The chairman position of Jeil Group was not one that just anyone could occupy.

Moreover, to others, he was just a nameless farmer. Who would want to give the captain's seat to such an incompetent person?

They had to overturn it somehow at the emergency general meeting. But there was something that bothered them.

"Kim Namchun is not answering?"

"He hasn't been answering since yesterday. We sent someone urgently to Gyeongsan, but he wouldn't meet us. His secretary only said he was out."

It didn't feel right. Wasn't he a man who prided himself on his calculations?

He was like an old snake who always calculated his gains and losses. For such a snake-like old man to suddenly cut off all contact.

Son Gangwook felt his lips drying up.

"Hyun, have you been composing like this all along?"

Karas couldn't hide her surprise as she looked at the sheet music stacked in one corner of the studio.

Of course, it was the same reaction from every musician who had visited the studio so far. Moreover, wasn't the number of sheet music even greater than before?

"It was to not forget the inspiration that came to mind."

"That's amazing. Even if I were told to compose like this, I couldn't have done it."

"You're flattering me."

I hesitated for a moment and then brought up the topic.

"Maestro, may I ask why you're having your comeback stage at the London Symphony? I thought you would go to the Berlin Phil."

Wasn't she once the conductor representing the Berlin Phil? Moreover, the Karas Competition held in Germany was undoubtedly one of the top conductor competitions in the world. She and the Berlin Phil were inseparable.

"There is already a world-class maestro named Yuri at the Berlin Phil. Of course, the London Symphony's maestro Spencer is the same. However, the reason I applied for the guest conductor position in London without hesitation is because of you, Hyun. You will one day lead the London Symphony."

It was an unexpected story. To think she chose the London Symphony because of me.

The maestro didn't stop there and asked again.

"Hyun, how about enjoying college life in London?"

"In London?"

"You could come as an exchange student, or you could take a break from your studies and live as a member of the London Symphony. It wouldn't be bad."

"As a member?"

"Your violin skills are too good to waste. Rather than sticking to the position of a conductor, it wouldn't be bad to show your skills to the world as a violinist from time to time. It's not bad to experience many paths of music rather than walking the path of a conductor early on. This is purely advice from my fan heart."

Come to think of it, hadn't it been a long time since I held a violin on stage?

There was a time when I played the violin so much that my fingertips became numb.

For some reason, meeting the maestro made me feel like my dormant musical desires were boiling up again.

As evidence, didn't I want to pick up the violin right now?

"Hyun, shall we play the violin? I'll take care of the accompaniment."

"Do you mean you will personally accompany me, maestro?"

"Even as a child, my teacher advised me to pursue the path of a pianist rather than a conductor because I was so good at the piano. Come on."

The maestro sat on the piano bench like a little girl. I walked towards the dormant violin case.

My heart was fluttering as if I were meeting my first love again.

Teacher Deoksu sought me out again the day before the emergency general meeting. Hadn't he been wandering around like Hong Gil-dong for the past few days?

"Do you know the relationship between Jeil Group and Jeil Foundation?"

Teacher Deoksu asked me a question as if testing me.

"I'm not sure."

Of course, I knew the relationship between Jeil Group and Jeil Foundation.

In my past life, hadn't I worked under Director Im Hyera of Jeil Foundation? I knew the secrets of Jeil Foundation better than anyone else.

At that moment, Teacher Deoksu squinted his eyes and looked at me.

"Really?"

"Are you going to give me something good if I give the correct answer?"

"Absolutely, I'll tell you some good news."

I was curious about what scheme this old man was up to again.

"The Jeil Foundation did not handle the funding for Jeil Group in the past. It has been less than ten years since they shared the role of capital circulation with Jeil Insurance. This was due to Director Im Hyera's influence. If I'm not mistaken, the funds circulating within Jeil Foundation have already surpassed Jeil Insurance."

"Then why hasn't Son Gangwook tried to take over this place directly?"

"I told you earlier. It's because of Director Im Hyera's influence. Director Im Hyera is not managing Jeil Foundation and the gallery just because she is President Son Ilsung's wife. Clearly, Son Gangwook wants to draw a line with Director Im Hyera. I want to explain more deeply, but I don't know any more."

The reason Son Gangwook couldn't swallow the Jeil Foundation was because of Director Im Hyera. And the reason was rooted in her family.

Even though I knew all the secrets, I didn't bother to speak them out loud.

Teacher Deoksu seemed quite surprised, as if he hadn't expected such an answer.

"I see you weren't just quietly working on music in the studio. There are few individuals who know the relationship between Jeil Foundation and the Group so well. Moreover, Son Gangwook wants to draw a line with Director Im Hyera. In a way, it makes sense. If he tries to swallow her, he might end up being devoured instead. Tsk tsk."

"Now, tell me the good news you promised."

"You're quite impatient."

Wasn't the emergency general meeting just around the corner?

But Teacher Deoksu remained relaxed. On the contrary, I was the one who was anxious. What secret weapon did he have hidden?

At that moment, Teacher Deoksu looked at me and said,

"Go to Pyeongchang-dong."

On the day of the emergency general meeting, tension spread like an epidemic.

The faces of the executives attending the emergency general meeting were all heavy.

After all, it was the day the fate of Jeil Group, a company that had left its mark on the South Korean economy, was to be decided.

Then, breaking the heavy atmosphere, Son Gangwook spoke up.

"First, I don't understand. How can someone who has never appeared on the front lines of Jeil Group suddenly become the chairman? I don't think it's just my opinion. I believe the executives and shareholders attending today think the same. How can we entrust a huge enterprise like Jeil Group to a farmer who has been plowing fields all his life?"

Son Gangwook glanced around the room and added,

"Is this the Joseon Dynasty? Just because Cheoljong, a poor farmer, was of royal blood, he was made king. Even if the former chairman transferred his shares, how can we seat an old man in the chairman's position? At least Cheoljong was young."

His eyes gleamed like a tiger's.

"I ask everyone here today to join me in demanding the resignation of the newly appointed chairman. If this continues, the great ship of Jeil Group, with its grand history, will face a perilous journey, risking shipwreck on the smallest reef. The captain is someone who can't even read a compass!"

The meeting room buzzed. Those who had sided with Son Gangwook nodded, and even the noisy general assembly members joined in demanding the chairman's resignation.

Son Gangwook smiled faintly at the enthusiastic reaction. However, Teacher Deoksu remained completely relaxed, even cleaning his ear with a finger.

Then,

"I don't want to be chairman."

With that one sentence, the tumultuous meeting room became as calm as a lake.

Son Gangwook looked incredulous, his eyes wide, as Teacher Deoksu elaborated.

"I mean it. I don't want to be chairman. I hate such troublesome positions now that I'm old. I'd rather just receive dividends quietly. Why would I go through such trouble?"

"Are you saying you'll accept the resignation demand?"

"President Son Gangwook, let's get the wording right. It's not a resignation; I'm stepping down on my own. This position doesn't suit me."

"Then are you proposing a professional management system? Please clarify your intentions. This might be a trivial matter for you, sir, but for the many shareholders here today, it's a matter of livelihood!"

At Son Gangwook's threat, Teacher Deoksu chuckled.

How could he lie so blatantly without batting an eye? He wasn't worried about the shareholders' livelihood but his own future.

At that moment, Teacher Deoksu stood up. Like a dragon stretching, the room was instantly overwhelmed by his charisma.

"We don't need a professional manager. There's already a suitable candidate."

"A suitable candidate?"

"Someone who knows Jeil Group better than anyone and is second to none in management in South Korea."

At that moment,

Creak.

The main door of the meeting room opened. Instantly, all eyes turned toward the door.

From beyond the door appeared a figure, and Son Gangwook's eyes widened as if they would tear apart.

Kang Hyun was pushing a wheelchair. And in that wheelchair sat...

"Fatherâ€•!"

Chairman Wang, with the true visage of a tiger, was seated.
