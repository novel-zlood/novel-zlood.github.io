"The Castle in the Blue Sky."

Vienna, the capital of Austria, is a world-renowned city of music.

The proper nouns that referred to Vienna included the waltz, the Danube River, and Schönbrunn Palace.

However, as time passed and the 20th century arrived, one more thing was added: the Castle in the Blue Sky.

An empress named Karas had purchased a palace where a great Austrian noble once lived.

As a result, it was widely said that the queen of Austria did not live in Schönbrunn or Belvedere Palace, but in the Castle in the Blue Sky.

“Adam, what are you looking at so intently?”

“A family photo of Empress Karas.”

In Adam's hand was a photograph. It was the publicly released family photo of Empress Karas.

In the past, with the Castle in the Blue Sky as the background, the young empress and her child held hands.

“Adam, do you know that Hyun was invited to the castle by the empress?”

Of course, it was a rumor that had already spread widely in the classical music world. The empress Karas, who had disappeared from the world for a while, not only reappeared but also personally invited a young conductor named Kang Hyun to her castle.

“Seventeen years have already passed.”

It had been that long since Karas disappeared from the Castle in the Blue Sky.

After her child passed away, she had declared her sudden retirement, abandoning everything she had built throughout her life. Despite numerous maestros and musicians trying to dissuade her, her firm resolve could not be broken.

It might have been inevitable. For her, the most important thing was not music or conducting, but her child.

“Adam, have you heard that rumor?”

“What rumor?”

“The rumor that a ghost lives in Karas' castle.”

What nonsense was this? Adam looked at Sharon with a puzzled expression, but her face was not only firm but calm.

“You’ve heard that apart from Karas, her secretary, and the maids, no one lives in the castle, right?”

“I know. The empress would never let just anyone into her home.”

“Right, according to a maid who worked at Karas' castle, there are dozens of rooms in the castle, but only a few are actually used. Every time, at the same hour, ghostly sounds are heard from one of the empty rooms.”

What?

“From a room where no one lives.”

* * *

Creak.

With a ghastly sound, the door of room ‘0703’ opened ajar. Because the lights were off, nothing could be seen beyond the door.

Just as eyes were narrowed in concentration,

Boom—!

Lightning struck, illuminating the window.

Gulp.

A pale figure was seen, but after rubbing the eyes with sleeves, the head was quickly turned away.

If someone were indeed living there as Karas said, then this would be a significant trespass.

Steps were hurriedly taken, but for some reason, there was a continuous itchy feeling at the back of the head.

“I should write a score.”

Was it because of the sound of the heavy rain hitting the window, or because of the mysterious room ‘0703’? The eerie melody kept crossing the mind.

Notes on the staff were being drawn continuously as if painting a picture, for instance, a solemn piece resembling Schubert's Erlkönig was being born.

Knock knock.

How much time had passed? There was a knocking sound from beyond the door. I put down the score, stood up, and slowly pulled the doorknob.

“Oppa, are you still awake?”

A sigh of relief was let out unknowingly as the ice queen in pink pajamas stood in front, looking just like a girl of her age at times like this.

But why had she come here at such a late hour?

“I heard strange sounds and got scared, so I couldn't stay alone.”

“Strange sounds?”

“Yes, didn't you hear them, oppa?”

What sounds could she be talking about? Suddenly, the heavy rain outside the window came to mind.

Indeed, the raindrops were thick enough to remind one of the monsoon season in Korea. Moreover, thunder and lightning occasionally struck with loud noises.

“Not the sound of rain!”

As if reading my thoughts, Son Yooha raised her voice. So what sound could she be hearing at this late hour?

Could it be the sound of an animal? But with such heavy rain, it was unlikely that animal sounds would be heard.

“It was definitely a human voice.”

“A human voice?”

“Yes, it sounded like someone was whispering.”

It almost seemed like she was becoming frail these days. Surely, she hadn't been sleeping with earphones in.

At that moment, a place suddenly came to mind.

‘Room 0703?’

No way, this wasn't a haunted house. Even though it seemed unlikely, I shook my head.

Seeing Yooha slowly sitting by the bedside, it looked like she intended to spend the night here.

“Oppa, can I sleep here?”

A grown woman saying she wants to sleep anywhere, I wanted to scold her, but seeing Son Yooha's expression, I couldn't say anything.

She looked like a scared puppy. It was far from the image of the ice queen who used to control the executives at Jeilmul.

“Fine, sleep on the bed. Oppa will sleep downstairs.”

It seemed like it would take all night to pour out the remaining ideas in my head.

Moreover, with Son Yooha lying on the bed, somehow, I couldn’t feel at ease. Then it happened.

Ah—!

A scream, not a scream, was heard from outside. Son Yooha froze with wide eyes.

I opened the door and slowly went out. Yooha, scared of being alone, tightly grabbed my hand and followed.

The hallway of the mansion was somewhat dark with only dim lights spaced along the walls. When we finally reached the source of the sound, I called out.

“Manager?”

Manager Kim Sang-guk was sitting, holding his foot.

“I twisted my ankle without realizing it. I was going to the bathroom in my sleep and…”

Only then did Son Yooha relax and loosen her grip.

“Oh, you were with Yooha? Don’t tell me, at this late hour, the two of you…”

“This is all your fault, Manager. Stop with the nonsense and get up from in front of the bathroom.”

Supporting Manager Kim Sang-guk, I helped him up. He seemed so clumsy, unlike the Prime Minister Kim Sang-guk I saw in a past life.

As the tension eased and a silly laugh escaped, I felt a prickling sensation at the back of my head once again.

What is this?

It felt as if someone was watching me.

* * *

“HYUN?”

Gerard Calvin, the vice president of Calvin Pharmaceuticals, furrowed his brow as he murmured Kang Hyun's name.

It was a time when the stock price of the pharmaceutical company was skyrocketing due to the development of a new anti-cancer virus drug. At this crucial moment, it turned out that a foreigner held the shares related to the new drug development.

“Instead of sitting there like a mute, give me your opinions.”

Gerard’s expression was exceedingly arrogant. And rightly so, he hadn’t climbed to the position of vice president at a young age without some luck.

Compared to his half-brother, another vice president named John Calvin, he was nothing short of a rogue.

“Vice President, what the investment companies want is their profit and benefit, so we should just pay the appropriate price, shouldn’t we?”

Gerard shook his head at the executive's opinion.

“John's side won't be easy to deal with if it’s about playing with money. They must know that if they absorb this person’s shares, the pharmaceutical company will become theirs. Don’t you have a more creative idea? For now, tell me about VH Company's history.”

As he listened to the history of VH Company, Gerard's facial expression changed moment by moment.

At first, he thought it was mere luck that they had invested in Calvin Pharmaceuticals. But upon examining closely, it was an extraordinary investment company.

Not only did they hold significant shares in Barbara Mining, but they were also diversely invested in global IT companies.

“What is the identity of the representative named Hyun?”

Gerard voiced his question. It was unbelievable.

The footsteps of VH Company so far were just like that.

He had heard that except for a few subordinates, the entire investment company moved according to the representative's sole discretion. It was said they didn’t even raise investment funds externally.

However, looking at VH Company's choices, it was as if they were foreseeing the future.

Chirp chirp chirp—!

The morning of a summer day begins with the chorus of cicadas.

On the wide pond, water striders flaunt their long legs as they float, just like on a reservoir.

In the garden, Maestro and Son Yooha were already enjoying tea time together. To a stranger, they might seem like a warm grandmother and granddaughter.

“It’s like a painting.”

The scenery seen from the Maestro's mansion was nothing short of a picture.

Opening the window and feeling the incoming breeze felt refreshing even without washing my face. Then,

“Hyun, you need to come out and prepare for a moment.”

“Why?”

“The vice president from Calvin’s side is here and wants to meet you.”

It had been quiet for a while. Although I had said I wouldn’t make an appointment until I visited them, they couldn’t sit still with fire under their feet.

Moreover, it seemed they had found out that I was staying at Karas' mansion.

“I’ll go out and meet them myself so as not to trouble the Maestro.”

It wouldn’t do to disturb the Maestro while she’s enjoying her tea time.

After a quick wash, I dressed comfortably.

Even though it was a business visit, it was an unexpected appointment. There was no need to greet unwelcome guests in a suit.

“Hyun, the Maestro said it’s okay to use the reception room. She said to use the mansion as if it’s your own home while you’re here.”

“I’ll discuss it with the Maestro once more. It feels too rude.”

Even if the Maestro favored me, there were lines that shouldn’t be crossed.

However, the Maestro, as always, with a kind grandmotherly expression, encouraged me to use the reception room.

She said there was no need to go outside unnecessarily, especially with all the spacious reception rooms available.

Eventually,

“You brought an interpreter too?”

I met the vice president of Calvin Pharmaceuticals in the reception room. They even brought an interpreter for German. It seemed they didn’t know I could speak German.

“Manager, please step outside. I’d like to talk with the vice president alone. Leave the interpreter.”

As the slick-haired vice president nodded, things proceeded swiftly.

Soon, the spacious reception room only had the vice president, the interpreter, and me.

After exchanging brief greetings, a moment of silence followed.

“Is this kid really the representative of VH Company? Check it out.”

The vice president spoke in an arrogant tone while looking at me. He always wore a faint smile, so without understanding German, it would have been impossible to know.

“What kind of connection does this kid have with Karas to be staying here? It’s really fascinating. He’s only nineteen, yet he’s the representative of an investment company.”

The vice president seemed flustered. He probably didn’t expect me to be this young. Or he might have thought there was a big shot backing me up.

“Ask him what he wants in return; tell him we can give him anything.”

Sweating profusely, the interpreter politely conveyed the message. It almost seemed like they were recreating the language. To a stranger, it would have seemed that the vice president was very polite and courteous.

At that moment,

“Do you think the kid wants a lot?”

Fluent German flowed from my mouth.
