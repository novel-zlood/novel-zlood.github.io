There is a technique called reporting.

One common mistake that new employees often make is coming out to give a presentation and merely chanting the report as if they were reading a passage from a Korean language textbook. Additionally, the abstract words and uncertain tone they use cause the audience to distrust them.

"Manager Kim, may I ask you something first?"

I looked at the faces of the strategic planning team employees while leaving the documents received from Manager Kim Sang-guk aside. While Manager Kim Sang-guk's face was full of interest, the rest of the employees looked uncomfortable.

That's because they had never seen a heated debate between me and Manager Kim Sang-guk before.

"I believe everyone has already reviewed the contents of the report. So, I will speak frankly. Instead of explaining the report repeatedly to make you understand, I hope you will ask me about the points you don't understand. The point of a presentation is to convey the core quickly."

The faces of the strategic planning team employees, including Deputy Manager Oh Tae-seok, were full of absurdity and displeasure.

It didn't matter. There was no need to make a grand effort to persuade them. After all, I wasn't really a new employee.

Moreover, I looked like a young student, so I needed boldness to renew our relationship going forward.

"Ahem, if we look at the contents of the report, it seems plausible, but most of it is about predicting a future that is far-fetched. Honestly, even if we applaud the fact that a high school student's perspective could grasp this much of the global market, this is a place where the company's fate is at stake, not a school club. Especially regarding the investment value of ADAM and the future evaluation of LAS, I think it's not just unrealistic but almost like a novel."

The middle-aged man, who looked like he had a significant role in the NIS in the past, was not ordinary. No wonder, as this group consisted of people with extraordinary backgrounds.

Had I not appeared with President Son Ilsung, I would have been kicked out of the company by now.

With a tense atmosphere in the room,

"I don't think it's an unrealistic novel at all. If you don't mind, I'd like to point out the parts you seem to have overlooked."

"Overlooked parts? Go ahead."

"First, you gave a failing grade to the investment value of ADAM. That's probably because you think their main product is just a facade? It may not be effective yet, and you might think of the signing system as just an extension of a simple promise. But the future will be different. The signing system for corporate management will become more widespread."

It was a time when the spread of computers was expanding. The signature was just a promise like bill processing.

However, as time passed and the communication field shifted from offline to online, interest in security would inevitably increase.

For example, in the future, the annual loss in the U.S. due to IT security will exceed billions.

Quick-moving companies are already focusing on online security rather than offline security.

"Shall we move on to the second point?"

Manager Kim Sang-guk looked at me with curious eyes. The debate continued.

The middle-aged man from the NIS kept questioning me with eyes that said he wouldn't lose, but I wasn't intimidated. After all, the experience I gained at the Western District Prosecutors' Office was not for nothing.

Deputy Manager Oh Tae-seok and the others were already half-dazed.

Then,

Clapâ€•!

With the sound of clapping, Manager Kim Sang-guk stood up. It was already lunchtime.

The face of the unnamed middle-aged man turned red and blue. It must have been hard for him, as he couldn't stop in the middle and there were many eyes watching, with a young person like me answering back each time.

As all the employees left the conference room, Manager Kim Sang-guk showed me a thumbs-up.

"I've never seen Team Leader Kim's poker face shake like that. Despite his stern appearance, he's usually called the Buddha of the strategic planning team because he always keeps quiet. It seemed like you were drawing him into your pace."

"Did it seem like that?"

"Was that your intention?"

Of course, in my past life at the Western District Prosecutors' Office, I'd handled many high-ranking officials.

There's a term in prosecutorial slang called "Galkae," which means to draw heavy-bottomed suspects into my pace by subtly probing them during interrogation.

"Did that really happen?"

Son Ilsung's eyebrows twitched.

"Yes, President. It was so impressive that Team Leader Kim was shaken during the meeting. If it weren't for his young appearance, one might suspect he was a veteran scouted from a rival company. He knew exactly how to navigate a disadvantageous situation, like a seasoned veteran."

President Son Ilsung's expression was not good while listening to Manager Kim Sang-guk's report.

He was too perfect. I knew why his father liked him. After all, his father was someone who had gathered talents under the name of a Daeil Group scholarship since his youth.

It wouldn't make sense not to be captivated by Kang Hyun, who was outstanding enough to be called a phoenix among chickens.

"But, President, is the violinist Hyun mentioned in the newspapers the same person as Kang Hyun?"

"Yes, didn't you know, Manager Kim?"

"I couldn't believe it. I'm not one to enjoy classical music, and I never imagined that the violin prodigy Hyun and Kang Hyun were the same person. I only realized it after seeing the photo in the newspaper. I don't think the team members know yet."

Of course, it was hard to believe. In life, you come across many outstanding people. Some are even called geniuses, but they often lack in other areas.

However, Kang Hyun was different. He stood out in everything, like a seasoned veteran.

Even the golden carp in the pond seemed to follow Kang Hyun more than Son Ilsung.

"Alright, you may go."

Not long after Manager Kim Sang-guk left, the intercom in the president's office rang, and Son Ilsung's face brightened as he picked up the receiver.

"Yes, Yooha. Did you arrive in the U.S. safely?"

It was his only daughter, who had gone back to study abroad after the spring break. Son Ilsung's voice rose in excitement at the voice of his precious daughter. But unfortunately, the voice on the other end was looking for someone else, not Son Ilsung.

"Hyun? Hyun is probably in Pyeongchang-dong. Or maybe the gallery..."

Of course, he was most likely having lunch at the cafeteria, but Son Ilsung deliberately changed the subject.

Was he jealous of Wang Chairman's favor? No way, the Daeil Group would eventually come into his hands. Moreover, if Kang Hyun was such an outstanding talent, he would have favored him even without Wang Chairman's influence.

The reason Son Ilsung was not fond of Kang Hyun was simple. His daughter Yooha liked Kang Hyun too much.

"Alright, Yooha. Call your dad often."

Son Ilsung couldn't hide his disappointment at his precious daughter's consistent reaction.

Maybe because the first hot day of summer was approaching, the weather was very hot.

Since lunchtime, the mansion in Ichon-dong was filled with the savory smell of boiling Samgyetang.

It was the first time it had been this hot since I came to Seoul, so after a long time, I was in the garden with my father, shirtless, washing each other's backs. 

As my grandfather and mother watched us with smiles,

"Hyun, you've grown up a lot."

An unexpected visitor arrived at Ichon-dong. It was my uncle and aunt.

It wasn't because they smelled Samgyetang boiling. They probably came to ask for my grandfather's forgiveness again after failing before.

"Beom-gyeong, why did you come up from Jeju Island without your father's permission again?"

"Father, you know I come to the mainland once a month because of my diabetes."

It seemed they had changed their strategy since they were not asking for forgiveness outright. My aunt also seemed to be looking for the right moment to jump in.

"Ahem, Hyun. Go change your clothes and get ready to go out. Hyunja, prepare Samgyetang for Chairman Son as well."

But my grandfather was not someone to be easily fooled. My uncle and aunt's faces distorted as soon as my grandfather said he was leaving.

I should suggest sending my uncle not to Jeju Island but to Tsushima Island. As long as he has insulin, he should be fine.

"We've arrived, Chairman."

We went to Pyeongchang-dong with the Samgyetang we had boiled. There must be a housekeeper who could cook Samgyetang there, and the place was always set with a meal fit for a king.

The reason my grandfather took me to Pyeongchang-dong was simple. With Chairwoman Im Hyera and President Son Ilsung both on overseas business trips, Wang Chairman was probably feeling quite lonely in the big house.

"Old man, why did you bring all this?"

"I brought it myself because I was worried you might skip meals living alone. So stop being so stubborn and get married again. You're still strong."

"Come on, if it's so good, you get married first."

Chairman Wang, who was tending the garden in hemp clothes and a straw hat, clapped his hands when he saw the thermos I was holding. At times like this, he seemed like a kind old man from the neighborhood.

We set out the bundle of food my mother had packed on the large dining table. The Samgyetang was so well-cooked that the bones and flesh fell apart with a single touch of the tongue.

"Hyun, are you still going to Seocho-dong these days?"

"Yes, grandfather."

"How many times have you been there?"

It had been two months since I first went to Seocho-dong, so I had been there over a dozen times. The strategic planning team employees, who initially treated me coldly, were gradually starting to acknowledge me.

After all, I had a sort of power struggle with the team leader on the first day in the conference room.

"Tell me about the strategic planning team members."

"The members?"

"Yes, tell me what you saw and felt. Now that you've met them quite a few times, I want to hear about your perspective."

There wasn't much to say about my perspective since it was a place filled with outstanding individuals among outstanding individuals.

But everyone had their strengths and weaknesses.

"Deputy Manager Oh Tae-seok is not suitable as a team member, but he's very talented as an individual. He's more useful for reading sudden chart changes than for understanding the overall situation. On the other hand, Team Leader Kim Jung-won is slow to comment on sudden changes but has an excellent eye for reading the overall situation."

"The deputy sees the trees instead of the forest, while the team leader sees the forest instead of the trees?"

"Yes. In a way, they complement each other well, like gears fitting together. One side compensates for the other's shortcomings. Should I tell you about the other members too?"

I calmly explained the strategic planning team members. Of course, I excluded personal feelings and only talked about their professional aspects. By the time the conversation was wrapping up, the Samgyetang bowl was empty.

Chairman Wang put down his spoon and looked at me.

"Who do you think is the most outstanding among them?"

"Probably Manager Kim Sang-guk? He oversees the strategic planning team."

"Then, if we were to place Manager Kim in another position in the future, where would be good?"

Manager Kim Sang-guk was a very capable person. From what I had observed in the past two months, he was much more capable than I had realized from glimpses in my past life.

Manager Kim was highly loyal and always thorough. Moreover, he thought everything through systematically, so it would be a waste to place him as the head of an affiliate company.

"Wouldn't Cheong Wa Dae suit him?"

"What? Why do you think so?"

"Because he fits well in a public position. His intellectual and resolute appearance also fits well."

Chairman Wang looked at me in amazement at the unexpected answer.

Of course, I couldn't tell him that in my past life, Manager Kim Sang-guk had become the Prime Minister. Perhaps what I said now would create a butterfly effect.
