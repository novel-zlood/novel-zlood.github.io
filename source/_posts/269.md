Time flows like a stream.

[The second half began with Korea and Portugal tied at 0:0. Ahn Jung-hwan, known as the "Terius of the ground," continues his dazzling dribbling. Lee Young-pyo, who received the pass, quickly kicks the ball forward. Park Ji-sung receives Lee Young-pyo's centering, Park Ji-sung! Chest trapping followed by a left-footed shoot―!]

The cheers of the entire nation of Korea echoed so loudly that it seemed the country might shake.

It was no different at the mansion in Ichon-dong. Grandfather, who was watching the World Cup while eating chicken, jumped up in surprise.

The parents, who were taking care of their two-month-old baby, Haengbok, also hugged each other, swallowing their cheers.

It was the decisive goal by the national team in their fierce match against Portugal.

The powerful left-footed shot by the then-21-year-old Park Ji-sung secured Korea's advancement to the round of 16.

"Kang Hyun, wasn't I right! I told you Korea could make it to the round of 16!"

Grandfather's face was clearly excited. Kang Hyun felt the same. Although he had seen this scene in his past life, watching it with his family at the Ichon-dong mansion felt entirely different.

Especially, Park Ji-sung's chest trapping followed by the left-footed shot was like a scene from a movie, even upon rewatching.

"Father-in-law, I lost the bet, but I've never been this happy. Look at Haengbok. Haengbok keeps smiling because he's so happy. Coochie-coo."

Father was smiling, holding his younger brother Haengbok in his arms.

Haengbok was also smiling brightly. The laughter of the infant, who seemed to find everything delightful, sounded more beautiful than any melody.

At that moment, Grandfather glanced at Kang Hyun and asked,

"Hyun, do you still think we can make it to the semifinals? I thought making it to the round of 16 was a blessing, but now I'm greedy and hoping for the quarterfinals."

Realistically, experts also predicted that Korea's advancement to the round of 16 would be difficult. The draw was not favorable, but Korea managed to unite and achieve it.

Kang Hyun nodded slightly with a faint smile.

"We will definitely make it to the semifinals."

Grandfather looked puzzled by Kang Hyun's confident assertion but soon nodded in agreement.

"Yes, as a man, it's good to have big goals." Grandfather shouted that the goal should be winning the World Cup and cheered for the national team.

[The Korean national soccer team is writing an unprecedented history. Advancing to the round of 16 and the quarterfinals is not enough; they have reached the penalty shootout against the European powerhouse Spain. Hwang Sun-hong is the first shooter. We believe in you. The Korean people believe in and support the national team. The referee blows the whistle―!]

The commentator's voice was visibly trembling. Yooha, who was holding Kang Hyun's hand tightly, was also breathing nervously. Indeed, no Korean at that moment would be calm.

As the national team players' shot made the net ripple, cheers burst through tightly closed lips. But the outcome was still uncertain.

[The final shooter for the Korean national team is Captain Hong Myung-bo. If he scores this goal, Korea will advance to the semifinals. Hong Myung-bo shoots the ball!]

At that tense moment,

[It's a goal, a goal―! The Korean national team advances to the semifinals of the World Cup! The national team has made history in Korean soccer. Truly, long live Korea. It's a moment of joy―!]

Korea started to shake. Citizens in red clothes poured into the streets of Seoul, cheering.

The wave-like cheers engulfed the entire nation.

Everyone was watching the World Cup together at the Ichon-dong mansion. Yooha, in her excitement, hugged Kang Hyun tightly and even sneaked in some kisses.

Smooch, smooch, smooch.

Parents were also hugging each other, overjoyed. Even Haengbok, lying in the cradle, was watching the scene and laughing gleefully.

Even Son Ilsung, who usually spoke little, had an excited look on his face. Seeing this, Im Hyera clung to her husband's arm playfully. Son Jangwon watched the scene with a satisfied smile.

Meanwhile, Grandfather looked at Kang Hyun with a curious gaze and spoke.

"We really made it to the semifinals."

The miraculous dream of reaching the semifinals had come true. Only then did Grandfather remember. Before the World Cup even started, Kang Hyun had confidently predicted this with certainty.

The reason the eternal maestro Gustav visited Korea was none other than Kang Hyun.

In a wheelchair, Gustav, with the help of his secretary, visited Kang Hyun's studio. Kang Hyun welcomed him with tea adorned with flower petals.

"Maestro, I was surprised by your sudden visit. I apologize for not keeping in touch often."

"Don't say that. The letters you occasionally send give this old man energy. I came to Korea because I wanted to see your face. I'm sorry for visiting so abruptly. This old man was curious about what musical achievements you've made."

"Is there any musician in the world who would be reluctant to welcome Maestro's visit? I'm honored that you remember me and came to see me. Please wait a moment."

Kang Hyun got up and handed the sheet music he had composed to Gustav. Seated in his wheelchair, Gustav looked at the sheet music Kang Hyun had painstakingly created and smiled contentedly.

Gustav knew that Kang Hyun was already hugely popular in the US and Europe. Despite his immense popularity, Kang Hyun did not neglect his music. The sheet music in front of him was more beautiful than ever.

The notes on the sheet music, like flowers blooming on fertile soil, made Gustav's heart flutter with excitement.

"Hyun, your boundless talent shows no sign of stopping. It makes this old man's heart race. I've met many musicians, but none have made me feel as comfortable and excited as you, except for Yasha."

Gustav clasped Kang Hyun's hand with his aged hands. There were not many musicians in the world with whom he felt so at ease.

Kang Hyun thought that the gaze of the eternal maestro looking at him was very similar to his grandfather's.

"Choi, bring that item."

At Gustav's words, his secretary brought over an old violin case.

Kang Hyun knew what it was. Gustav had already shown it to him once before.

"It is the last will of Yasha and the essence of his spirit, a violin. I tried to give it to you before, but you said it wasn't the right time."

It was the violin used by the legendary violinist Yasha Heifetz, who opened the 20th century.

The violin, glowing red like the horizon at sunset, was clearly well-maintained, emitting a mystical light.

The silver strings, gleaming as if they were about to play a melody, made the viewer's heart race.

"La felicità, that's its name."

"La Felicità."

"It means happiness in Italian."

Kang Hyun carefully received La Felicità. The legendary violin, once used by Yasha Heifetz, trembled lightly as if resonating with its new owner.

Gustav smiled knowingly as he watched Kang Hyun. His wrinkled eyes reflected the emotions of revisiting past memories.

"Could you play it for me?"

How could he refuse the request of the eternal maestro? As soon as he carefully held La Felicità, the deep emotions of a violinist began to surge.

Kang Hyun took his position to play for the eternal maestro. As his posture flowed naturally, La Felicità began to shine, as if it were back in the 20th century with Yasha Heifetz.

The first snow of winter had fallen. Kang Hyun and Yooha were leaving footprints together on the pristine snow.

Yooha, as promised, came to Korea as soon as she entered the Ivy League.

As they left footprints on the snow, Kang Hyun glanced at Yooha and asked,

"Do you still want to be with me?"

At that moment, Yooha squinted her eyes and asked back,

"Oppa, don't you?"

Kang Hyun had thought Yooha's choice might be a fleeting emotion. The image of the ice queen he had faced in his past life and her current appearance were so different.

But now Yooha was smiling more happily than ever. Just seeing the emotions in her eyes, Kang Hyun could read all her thoughts.

It was possible because they had each other.

"This is the first time we're hiking together like this."

As they climbed the mountain, Kang Hyun held Yooha's hand to make sure she wasn't struggling.

The winter scenery of Hallasan Mountain was breathtaking, making onlookers marvel.

The snow-covered cliffs looked sweet, as if someone had sprinkled sugar on them.

Seeing a deer playing on the snow-covered ground, Yooha laughed brightly like a child.

The snow-covered Hallasan Mountain was full of the energy of life. Surely, this winter kingdom was also waiting for the new sprouts of spring.

"Oh!"

At that moment, Yooha, who was climbing the stone steps, lost her balance. She closed her eyes tightly and screamed.

But instead of falling into the snow, Yooha found herself in Kang Hyun's arms. Kang Hyun had quickly caught her and held her.

"Careless as always."

Kang Hyun patted Yooha's head and helped her stand up again. But Yooha was touched by Kang Hyun's unchanged demeanor since childhood.

"Oppa!"

Yooha hugged Kang Hyun tightly and looked up at him. His smooth nose, deep eyes, and full lips were perfect for a kiss. Moreover, there were no other hikers around, making it the perfect timing.

Smooch.

Yooha kissed Kang Hyun and, feeling shy, ran ahead with quick steps. Kang Hyun hurriedly followed her, worried she might fall again.

The winter mountain was quiet. The wind blew over the snowy ridges, brushing the cheeks of the two lovers. It felt as if they were the only two people left in the white world.

Kang Hyun held Yooha's hand tightly, as if vowing never to let go, and continued walking. Toward their shared future.

"Snowflowers have bloomed on the pine trees."

Snowflowers had settled on the twisted pine trees.

The pine trees, growing differently depending on their environment, were like human lives. The pine tree in Kang Hyun's heart was also spreading new branches, having met a woman named Yooha.

At that moment, Yooha picked up some snow and scattered it over Kang Hyun's head, smiling. Not to be outdone, Kang Hyun also threw snow back at her. White snowflakes bloomed under the sky, blessing the two.

Kang Hyun had never known in his past life. That spending time with someone could be this happy.
