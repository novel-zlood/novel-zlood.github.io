In a university district in Seoul, it was still early in the evening to be drinking, but the pub was packed with students.

They were all dressed in the same attire as if they had made a pact. These students, wearing Korea University German Department baseball jackets, clinked their beer glasses together amidst boisterous laughter.

It was then.

Ding ding―!

A male student, resembling a bear, stood up while tapping a beer glass with a spoon.

"Attention, everyone! We have all gathered here to watch a broadcast featuring our pride from the Korea University German Department, Kang Hyun. Let's all have a toast for Kang Hyun, who is working hard as a judge in a faraway foreign country!"

At Kim Daewoo's shout, the students all raised their beer glasses without hesitation.

A terrestrial broadcast was already being projected onto the spacious wall of the pub using a beam projector. As the long commercials finally ended and the documentary on the 'Queen Elisabeth Competition' began, everyone held their breath and watched the screen.

"It's starting now."

In another mansion of Chappelle, the judges were gathered to watch the Queen Elisabeth Competition broadcast. Each of them held their favorite drink, whether it be vodka, whiskey, or wine.

As soon as Hugo finished speaking, the documentary's narration began.

[Today is the first day that the 12 new violinists, who are staying at Chappelle, will perform with the Belgian National Symphony Orchestra at the world-renowned Bozar Hall. Kang Hyun is with us as a judge leading these 12 new violinists.]

The antique interior and the ornate embossed patterns on the ceiling were as captivating as constellations in the night sky.

Furthermore, the vast audience seats, capable of accommodating thousands, were overwhelming to behold.

It was indeed worthy of being called one of the world's top three concert halls, like Carnegie Hall and Concertgebouw. Then it happened.

Boom boom boom―!

The grandeur of Bozar Hall was momentarily surprising, but soon, the majestic sound of the big drum resounded. It was the performance of the Belgian Symphony Orchestra.

Though it was an unexpected performance, it was so captivating that even the 12 new violinists on the screen, as well as the viewers, held their breath and watched.

At the end of the magnificent symphony, the camera captured Maestro Eden Simeon's figure.

[What did you all feel when listening to the symphony?]

What could this be?

[Can anyone identify the mistakes in the symphony that was just performed?]

Everyone was bewildered. However, when Anna from Russia found two mistakes, the judges beyond the screen let out soft exclamations.

Even for themselves, it was not easy to identify mistakes in a grand symphony immediately. But the surprise didn't end there.

[Hyun, can we expect the same from you this time?]

The camera alternated between zooming in on Maestro Eden Simeon and Kang Hyun. The judges beyond the screen also looked at Kang Hyun with curious eyes.

Kang Hyun felt his throat dry up from the sudden attention on him. The cameraman captured the shooting angle so well that it could be mistaken for a movie scene rather than a documentary.

Finally, Kang Hyun on the screen chuckled and began to speak.

[In the introduction of the first movement, the drumstick of the performer playing the big drum wavered. The tip of the performer's hand holding the drumstick relaxed slightly. It is hard to see it simply as a mistake; it seemed to be an intentional instruction from the maestro.]

……!

[Also, when playing the horn with a gestop, the performer did not completely cover the valve with his hand. As a result, a soft tone, instead of a sharp metallic one, was briefly heard. It seemed like the performer intentionally left about a third of the valve open when hand-stopping.]

The astonished gazes continued in silence. Not only the 12 new violinists on the screen but also the judges watching the documentary were in the same state.

[Regarding the second and third movements, since violinist Anna has already mentioned them, I won't discuss them. Lastly, in the highlight part that decorated the finale of the fourth movement, the maestro's conducting direction was wrong. However, the performers were not shaken and played correctly, as if it was prearranged.]

As Kang Hyun on the screen chuckled and concluded his remarks, the great Hugo from France dropped his jaw in admiration.

Hirose looked at Kang Hyun with a faint smile, as if he had expected it.

On the other hand, Viktor from Russia, who was drinking vodka, muttered to himself, "Unbelievable, truly," looking at Kang Hyun with a complex expression.

* * *

"Did you really guess it by intuition?"

Hugo's wrinkled eyes clearly showed curiosity. The other judges were no different.

When Kang Hyun nodded briefly in response, exclamations erupted from various places. The broadcast content was that shocking.

It was no easy task to identify mistakes in a grand symphony. One would need to master numerous instruments and conduct as well.

Moreover, Kang Hyun in the video did not even show a hint of hesitation.

"When I saw him correcting the mistakes in the score with a red pen, I thought it was a hidden camera prank that is popular among young people these days."

"I thought the same, now I understand why Gustav praised Hyun so much. Deng Lun, weren't you also quite surprised?"

"I already experienced it once seven years ago. Back then, Hyun was a young boy whose height barely reached my waist. Do you know how shocked the judges were at that time? Even the stubborn Alexei couldn't keep his mouth shut."

Through the media, Deng Lun had once said that if Kang Hyun, from seven years ago, participated in the current Queen Elisabeth Competition, he would win.

Most thought it was an exaggerated statement, but after watching today's broadcast, everyone agreed. Even Eden Simeon had said that young Kang Hyun had already solved all of his riddles seven years ago.

Kang Hyun was bombarded with endless questions, as if he had been invited to a hearing. Even the usually reserved judges did not hold back their questions for Kang Hyun.

In the end, he was even invited by great figures from various countries, including Hugo from France and Deng Lun from China, to visit their countries after the Queen Elisabeth Competition.

"Can we talk for a moment?"

It was after the hearing-like session ended, and he returned to his room. Viktor, who had been frowning until a moment ago, approached Kang Hyun and spoke softly.

Kang Hyun nodded and sat facing Viktor. Viktor hesitated for a moment, then sighed deeply and spoke.

"First, I must apologize for calling you a novice."

Will the sun rise from the west tomorrow? Kang Hyun wondered if he had heard wrong, but looking into Viktor's eyes, he realized he was sincere.

Kang Hyun leaned forward, gesturing that it was okay. After all, compared to Viktor's experience, Kang Hyun was just a drop in the bucket.

"I never believed in prodigies or geniuses. I think other musicians felt the same. But watching you, I can't deny that my values are changing."

Viktor handed a glass filled with vodka to Kang Hyun and continued the conversation.

The conversation continued until the full moon decorated the window dimly. Since coming to Brussels, it was the first time he had talked so much with Viktor.

‘We communicate better than I thought?’

He had thought of Viktor as just a stubborn old man. But wasn't he acknowledging his mistake and apologizing to Kang Hyun?

After that, the two continued their serious discussion about music.

"Hyun, you really know a lot about music."

Viktor's drunken antics were surprisingly cute. His tongue was short, and he kept smiling.

In the end, the first one to fall asleep was Viktor. Feeling so good, he kept drinking vodka and had a broad smile on his face.

When Kang Hyun carried him to the bed, the sound of snoring was heard as if by magic.

"Looks like sleeping right away is out of the question again."

If an ox were to bellow, would it sound like this? Kang Hyun chuckled and covered the sleeping Viktor with a blanket.

Then he picked up his violin case and walked outside.

* * *

Anna couldn't sleep. Even lying on the bed, she couldn't easily fall asleep.

Of course, the stage was now less than two days away. Other participants must feel the same. Even if she closed her eyes, musical notes kept appearing in her mind.

At some point, the full moon that had brightly lit up the night sky began to fade, and a faint light appeared beyond the horizon.

"Sigh."

Eventually, Anna grabbed her coat and walked outside. If she faced the early morning breeze blowing from Chappelle, her thoughts would naturally disappear.

Buzz.

At that moment, Anna unknowingly moved towards the melody piercing her ears.

It was a melody resonating from the forest beyond Chappelle's garden.

She hesitated for a moment, but soon moved forward, enchanted by the melody that was heard again.

The rustling sound of the leaves lowered their heads and looked at Anna.

The long bushes swayed in the early morning breeze as if dancing.

The chirping of insects took on the role of accompaniment, like the melody of a delicate harp.

Gulp.

Anna swallowed her saliva and moved forward. Along with the sound of flowing water from a nearby stream, the owner of the melody appeared. But the exact face was obscured by darkness.

Anna, immersed in ecstasy, became the sole audience without even thinking of confirming the violinist's face.

How much time had passed?

The dawn was rising over the night sky filled with the full moon.

Through the mist like sea fog, the violinist's face became clear.

But the surprise didn't end there. Beneath the continuous melody in the forest, the sound of footsteps like glass slippers was heard.

Anna rubbed her eyes with her sleeve and looked ahead. More precisely, at the mysterious light approaching the violinist through the mist.

Thump thump thump.

Suddenly, Anna felt her heart pounding. Soon, through the hazy mist, a clear horn appeared.

Anna's eyes widened. The figure that emerged with the dawn through the twilight was a pure white deer.

What on earth.

Anna couldn't believe her eyes. The pure white deer really seemed to appear out of thin air through the mist.

Thump thump thump.

A mystical halo poured down along with the melody. The pure white deer moved with all the sounds like a leader of the forest.

Anna felt a certain sacredness. Perhaps this was how those who faced Christ in the past felt.

At that moment, the pure white deer rubbed its face as if greeting the violinist.

But the violinist, playing with eyes closed, was unaware of the situation.

With the dawn pouring down, a mystical halo flowed over the violinist's entire body.

How much time had passed? In the dream-like space and time, Anna, holding her pounding heart, closed and opened her eyes.

"Anna?"

The violinist, Kang Hyun, who was playing alone in the forest, was now approaching her.

Kang Hyun seemed surprised to see Anna kneeling among the bushes.

But Anna tried to find the pure white deer she had just seen rather than answering him. But the pure white deer was nowhere to be seen.

Only the brilliant dawn was shining on Kang Hyun.
