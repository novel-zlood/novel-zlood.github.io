[Chirp chirp chirp─!

The sound of cicadas echoed clearly from the green shade.

It was a time when there were no gray forests in the city. Apartments were homes only accessible to the middle class, and the majority of the population lived in houses.

There was even a joke that neighbors knew each other so well that they knew the number of spoons each other had.

After school, the laughter of children never ceased in every corner of the neighborhood. To think I would feel that way again.

Meanwhile, the TV was buzzing with news about the Jeil Group.

“Wow, the Jeil Group is truly impressive!”

Father exclaimed in awe while watching TV.

The Jeil Group not only developed the semiconductor business, known as a barren field, but also became the first in the world to develop a 256M DRAM.

When they first ventured into semiconductors, there were rumors that Chairman Wang had lost his mind.

By now, President Son Ilsung would be on the front lines of the business. He's someone Kang Hyun has met before.

“If you do not change, you will eventually die.”

A saying that Son Ilsung always had on his lips.

Son Ilsung practically changed everything except his immediate family. The first thing he did after Chairman Wang died was to oust his own brother from the group.

Reflecting on the untold stories I witnessed while staying with the Jeil Group's legal team, I realized just how aggressive he was.

That's why they maintain the firm first place in the business world.

[Prime Minister Ko Jinwoo and Jeil Electronics President Son Ilsung are inspecting the semiconductor factory together. This marks the moment when South Korea stands tall as a leading player in the global semiconductor industry. We can sense that South Korea is stepping closer to joining the OECD, just half a century after the Korean War. It's truly a moving moment.]

The Son Ilsung on TV looked much younger than I remembered.

I shook my head. He was someone I would never meet again.

It was then.

“Son, what will you do during summer vacation?”

Mother brought out a tray of watermelon. I picked up a piece and handed it to Father. Then, I picked another piece and handed it to Mother, and said,

“I'll help out at the dry cleaner's. It's peak season, after all.”

It was a time when air conditioning wasn't common in every household. Most people were using fans to beat the heat, so many sweaty people came to the dry cleaner's.

But Mother's expression was not good. Father was the same. They exchanged glances and then spoke.

“Son, Mom is so proud of you, but I'm worried. If we really need help, we'll let you know. How about visiting your grandfather's house this summer vacation? He said he wants to see his grandson.”

“Yeah, Kang Hyun. Don't study during summer vacation. Go to your grandfather's house, explore the city, and enjoy some good food.”

They must have felt sorry seeing me help out at the dry cleaner's every day after school. I was running around the neighborhood with my small frame, collecting laundry. It was understandable.

Moreover, I studied until late at night, so my parents were more worried than pleased. Come to think of it.

‘Grandfather passed away about five years later.’

He was already over seventy. Around the time I was a university student, Grandfather passed away due to old age.

At that time, I didn't even properly attend his funeral. I was at the funeral hall for about thirty minutes before returning to the reading room. Ugh.

I felt as if a lump of sweet potato was stuck in my throat. How ungrateful was I back then? I felt endlessly guilty.

But regret is useless for a life already lived. Haven't I resolved to never let that happen again?

With those words, my parents' faces brightened.

“Mother, what kind of food did Grandfather like?”

* * *

I traveled for a long time by intercity express bus.

It was still a time when the word "non-smoking area" was unfamiliar. People smoked not only in bars but also in teachers' offices and companies without much concern.

The express bus was no exception. Each seat had an ashtray on the back of the headrest, making it perfect for smokers.

The strong smell of cigarettes made my throat sour, but I also felt a craving for a puff.

I turned my gaze to the window, wiping my nose for no reason. The highway, bustling with cars that hit the 1990s, stretched ahead. And then.

[Dongseoul IC]

The sign came into view.

Although I was going to Grandfather's house, in a way, it was like coming up to Seoul from the provinces.

“Please take me to Ichon-dong.”

It was late, and I didn't know the bus routes, so I took a taxi. If it weren't for the money Grandfather had set aside for my visit, I wouldn't have been able to take a taxi.

The taxi driver glanced at Kang Hyun's face through the rearview mirror and remarked about living in a good neighborhood.

“We're here, student.”

At the taxi driver's words, I looked up and out the car window. It was Dongbu Ichon-dong, one of the most affluent areas in Seoul, just like Apgujeong-dong.

It's a place where you can often find successful singers, actors, as well as politicians and business figures.

With a clear view of the Han River, it's traditionally a high-priced neighborhood.

Streetlights, still rare in the provinces, brightly lit this area as if it were daytime.

Thud.

I had been here before in the past. However, too much time had passed to rely on memory alone. I followed the map Mother had drawn.

“It's grand.”

A high gray wall, almost like a fortress, came into view. When I rang the bell attached to the large gate, an elderly woman's voice was heard. It must be the housekeeper.

“It's Kang Hyun.”

The iron gate opened with a loud noise.

Between the flat stone steps, expensive-looking ornamental trees caught my eye. Golden carp swam gracefully in a pond that added to the garden's charm.

Holding a bundle in one hand, I entered the mansion.

“Kang Hyun, you must have had a hard time coming from so far.”

The housekeeper welcomed me.

The interior of the mansion was filled with antique furniture. It felt more like restrained elegance rather than luxury.

“What is all this?”

“Mother packed some food that Grandfather likes.”

“Oh dear. The elderly man will be very pleased. Oh, my mind! Kang Hyun, give me the food and wait in the living room. You know there's a family gathering today, right?”

A family gathering?

Without showing my confusion, I moved to the living room. The spacious sofa was already occupied by guests. They were all dressed in extravagant luxury brands.

It's awkward to call them relatives. Nominally, they are Mother's siblings, but there was no interaction. To be precise, they all looked down on Mother.

“What are you doing here?”

My eldest uncle looked at Kang Hyun with a puzzled expression. His voice was full of dissatisfaction.

Is this a place I shouldn't be? My uncles, as well as my aunt, glared at me.

“Hyunja must be trying to please Father now. She said she didn't need money or family and cut off contact when she left home, and now she sends her son? It's too obvious, isn't it, oppas?”

My aunt, wearing a large ring, said while sipping her tea.

That woman has always had a knack for speaking harshly, regardless of the place.

In the past, I would have turned red and run out of the mansion immediately, but having lived a middle-aged life, I suppressed the urge to laugh.

“Grandfather called me.”

As I said that, I took a seat on one side of the sofa. The mention of Grandfather calling me changed the expressions of my aunt and uncles instantly.

“Grandfather called you? Oppas, does this make sense?”

It was then.

“Yes, I called him.”

Grandfather, dressed in a modernized hanbok, came out from the study. The uncles and aunt, who had looked so arrogant, quickly corrected their expressions and postures like model students.

Grandfather looked remarkably strong for someone in his seventies. I hadn't seen him often in my past life. He passed away when I was about nineteen, so it was almost like meeting him again after decades.

He used to look so intimidating.

“I heard Kang Hyun ranked first in his class this time. I told him to spend his summer vacation comfortably at my house because I was proud of him.”

No one dared to argue with Grandfather's firm words.

“Our Seok also ranked third in his class this time, Father.”

The aunt wearing the large ring added reluctantly. She had no idea that her precious son would be caught cheating in the future.

Years later, she suddenly appeared out of nowhere asking me to save her son because he was still family. What happened?

That cousin stayed in prison until I left the Western District Prosecutors' Office. Later, I heard the aunt fell ill from the stress.

Grandfather didn't even respond to my aunt's words. Instead, he looked at me and asked softly.

“How is your mother?”

Grandfather had cut ties with Mother. Perhaps he missed his children as he got older. In my previous life, Grandfather never sought me out like this. There must have been a butterfly effect in areas I wasn't aware of.

“Yes, Grandfather.”

As our conversation continued, my uncles' expressions grew more unpleasant. As our talk was about to end,

“Father, we should discuss the company matters now. Shall we have Hyun join his cousins? The children would love to see him after such a long time.”

“Yes, Father.”

My aunt quickly supported my eldest uncle's suggestion. They seemed terrified at the thought of me staying in the meeting instead of Mother.

These folks remain as black-hearted as ever. Reeking with malice.

“Grandfather, I'll head upstairs now. As Uncle suggested, it would be nice to catch up with my cousins.”

Grandfather gave a short nod.

I stood up, bowed to Grandfather, and walked away.

Upstairs, a large room was already filled with my cousins. The room was so big it could be mistaken for a living room in an average home. My cousins were gathered in groups.

The younger ones were playing with toys.

“What are you doing here?”

The older cousins were sitting together, pretending to be adults. Especially my aunt's eldest son, who was the oldest.

His name was Yoo Jinseok, two years older than me.

Yoo Jinseok got up and walked toward me. Among the cousins, he acted like the king because of his age. He was much taller than me and had an arrogant expression, just like his mother.

“Are you deaf? What are you doing here?”

Yoo Jinseok asked again with a coercive expression.

The image of him begging me to save him after committing fraud and embezzlement overlapped in my mind.

I scanned the elegant room. This wealth, which seemed eternal.

“Jinseok.”

Grandfather passed away, and within less than five years, the family fell apart.

“Don't mess with me.”

Yoo Jinseok's eyes widened at my sudden informal speech.

“What?”

Just as Yoo Jinseok's face turned red and he raised his hand,

“Uh……?”

He felt himself tilt. Then, he realized that my hand was roughly grabbing his hair.

The children were too shocked to speak. It happened in an instant. With my small frame, I tripped Yoo Jinseok and grabbed his hair.

These cousins inherited their parents' cowardice. They had a tendency to look down on anyone who showed a weakness.

But having lived a long life as a prosecutor, I had experienced all sorts of hardships.

Handling these kids was.

Snap.

“If you mess with me again.”

Yoo Jinseok, with his head bent backward, nodded repeatedly as he stared into my glaring eyes.

“You're dead.”

It was the easiest thing ever.]
