Snip―!

Chairman Wang was trimming the branches of an old pine tree.

Looking at the old pine tree that twisted and turned from the base upwards, he thought it resembled life itself.

Isn't it said that life doesn't always go as planned? It was no different for plants. Although they appear to be ever-green, upright, and maintaining integrity and loyalty, pines are sensitive to their environment and change accordingly.

However, if the branches are trimmed this meticulously, they won't twist regardless of the winds and adversities.

"Son-ga, why are you so lost in thought?"

At that moment, Chairman Yoo walked over from beyond the garden. Chairman Wang, dressed in hemp clothes, put down his garden shears and wiped the thick beads of sweat from his neck with a towel.

Despite being over seventy, his complexion was surprisingly rosy and his eyes were sharp.

"Old man, do you remember the day we first built the Seungjeongwon?"

"How could I forget? In a way, it's no exaggeration to say that Seungjeongwon is the reason Daeil Group is where it is today. You, as its owner, would know best how many significant events happened there."

Seungjeongwon, the place where Daeil Group's major decisions and key management meetings were held.

It was a building that fully reflected Chairman Wang's values and played a pivotal role in Daeil Group's history.

"Son-ga, do you still want to visit Seungjeongwon?"

"I feel a mix of relief and nostalgia. Seungjeongwon was the golden tower that brought Daeil Group wealth and honor. But now, I've passed it on to Ilsun. Looking back, it feels like we got here in the blink of an eye. When we first met in the detention center in our youth, we never imagined we’d stick together till old age."

"Indeed, we didn't. Back then, we both had fiery tempers."

Their eyes reflected the emotions of reminiscing the past. They resembled kings who had passed the throne to the crown prince.

"By the way, by now Hyun must have arrived at Seungjeongwon."

"I never imagined Chairman Barbara would call for Hyun, especially as the representative of VH Company. Kang Hyun must be quite surprised."

"Not just Kang Hyun. The heads of large corporations must also be equally surprised. I'm curious to see how Hyun will react. He’s like a young tiger dropped among seasoned predators."

After all, he's just barely over twenty.

Compared to Kang Hyun, the others were veterans who had experienced all sorts of ups and downs in the business world. There's an old saying that talent can never surpass experience. However...

"Son-ga, I have a feeling my grandson-in-law will accomplish something big."

Kang Hyun had not only talent but also experience.

* * *

Kim Sung-rak, the president of Dongshin Group, furrowed his brow deeply. But when his eyes met Chairman Barbara's, he quickly erased his expression.

He licked his dry lips, making it look like he had just bitten into a sour persimmon.

"Ahem. I never imagined Kang Hyun would attend this meeting as the representative of a company. I apologize for my mistake. May I ask what kind of company it is? Given how highly Chairman Barbara speaks of it, it can't be a small neighborhood store."

Not only Kim Sung-rak but also the other large corporation heads looked curious.

It was natural. VH Company was essentially an investment firm. Moreover, it focused on potential future value, making it seem like a charity to the uninformed before business results showed. It wasn't the type of company that usually caught the interest of large corporation heads.

"It's an investment firm."

"Investment?"

Kim Sung-rak looked puzzled. The other heads were the same. Chairman Barbara remained silent, observing where the conversation would go. Kim Sung-rak then asked smugly.

"I'm curious about the company's achievements."

"We do not accept investment trusts from individual investors. We invest in companies with high potential value through internal fund circulation."

"You don't accept investment trusts?"

Kim Sung-rak smirked.

"Haha. Running a business like that from a young age is a good way to broaden your economic perspective. I see you're not only good at playing the violin but also interested in business. However, money is scarier than fire. I commend you for not accepting individual investment trusts. It shows you have the conscience not to take on responsibilities you can't handle."

I wanted to get up and smack Kim Sung-rak on the head.

In my past life, didn't Dongshin Group's bankruptcy leave many people homeless? There were even rumors of a second foreign exchange crisis.

Listening to his sarcastic advice was unpleasant, but what could I do? That man would soon spend the rest of his life behind bars.

"Chairman Barbara must really like Kang Hyun. Seeing how she’s giving him such experience, I feel deeply moved. Today will be a great experience for Kang Hyun. After all, even though he’s a company representative, his company is relatively unknown."

"Mr. Kim, you're mistaken. I didn't invite Hyun here to give him experience."

"Pardon?"

As Kim Sung-rak looked puzzled, Chairman Barbara continued.

"Barbara Group's investment strategy is simple. We identify and choose companies with higher future growth potential. The reason I chose Korea over China or Japan in Asia is simple. Korea is home to companies with limitless future growth potential."

At that moment, the heads of large corporations all had a gleam in their eyes.

Since the foreign exchange crisis, attracting foreign investment had become a fierce competition, resembling a war without bullets.

Especially for a top-tier American company like Barbara Group, the competition was even more intense. Even the Blue House had been striving to attract investment from Barbara Group.

It was then.

"As you all know, Barbara Mining, a subsidiary of Barbara Group, had a poor reputation on Wall Street. Except for the Turupka region in Nepal several years ago, it had not shown any visible achievements. Barbara Mining's stock, which had been hitting rock bottom daily, was shunned even by Wall Street's hyenas. It was often jokingly said that Barbara Mining was overpriced like it was on Everest. However, there was someone who amassed Barbara Mining's stocks at that time."

The heads of large corporations exclaimed in admiration. They knew how well Barbara Mining was now received in the global stock market.

Having discovered the world's largest copper and gold deposits, there were even rumors of "Golden Wednesday."

"I arranged this meeting to seek advice from him. Not only did he amass Barbara Mining's stock, but he also stood out among many people I’ve met, possessing deep insight and wisdom."

"Chairman Barbara, do you mean he's here?"

"Of course."

At that moment, Chairman Barbara looked at me.

Naturally, the gazes of Kim Sung-rak and the other corporate heads turned to me. They all looked as if they had seen a ghost.

* * *

"Sir, here are the documents you requested."

Son Ilsung's eyes gleamed with curiosity. They were documents related to VH Company.

Before Chairman Barbara's decision to visit Korea, he hadn't even known about VH Company's existence.

When he heard the news from his father, he was beyond surprised; he was intrigued.

"VH Company is known to invest diversely in both domestic and international IT companies, as well as Barbara Mining. The direction and nature of their investments are so varied that it's hard to pinpoint specifics, but most of the companies on their investment list are still relatively unknown."

"Investing in the future, huh."

What happened at Seungjeongwon a few days ago was astonishing.

Kang Hyun had made significant investments in Barbara Mining, which even Wall Street had deemed unpromising.

The surprised looks of the corporate heads were still vivid in his mind. And what followed was even more spectacular.

"He's really something."

In his conversations with Kim Sung-rak and the other corporate heads, Kang Hyun didn't seem to be at a disadvantage at all.

Despite facing individuals who had weathered countless schemes and adversities, he seemed to gain the upper hand.

Considering Kang Hyun's age, it was almost unbelievable.

"Sir, as you mentioned earlier, Dongshin Group has contacted Dongju. However, it seems they are more interested in connecting on family matters than business."

"Kim Sung-rak's eldest daughter is twenty-five this year, isn't she?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Sure enough, Kim Sung-rak, who had previously been unapproachable, was now very friendly to Kang Hyun. One might even think he had always liked Kang Hyun.

It made sense, given that even the notoriously picky Chairman Wang had shown immense interest and favor towards Kang Hyun.

Not only Kim Sung-rak but also the other corporate heads seemed to covet Kang Hyun.

Crunch.

At that moment, Son Ilsung clenched his fist. His serious gaze was like that of a predator. He couldn't afford to lose his son-in-law.

It was on a private jet back to the U.S. Chairman Barbara had a deep smile on her face. It was like savoring a wine with a lingering aftertaste.

Visiting Korea had allowed her to see a new side of Kang Hyun.

Kang Hyun conversed with the corporate heads like a flexible reed that bends but never breaks. If his face were hidden, one wouldn't be able to guess his age from his eloquent speech.

"Tanya, if you were nineteen, could you show such composure?"

"It would be impossible for me. When I was young, I didn't have the luxury of being so bold and calm. Kang Hyun's demeanor reminded me of the king of deer in the Talmud. He has a youthful appearance but an old soul."

It was no exaggeration. Recalling the scene at Seungjeongwon, where Hyun debated with the corporate heads, it was no exaggeration at all. She even wanted to scout him as an executive for Barbara Group.

"Hyun's investment direction is truly impressive. I've spoken with many geniuses who chased the American Dream, but his insights were a new kind of shock. It was as if he could see the future."

The more she listened to Kang Hyun, the more Chairman Barbara couldn't hide her admiration.

To the uninformed, his plans might seem far-fetched, but his investment blueprint felt like it pierced through the future.

"By now, Korean companies must be in an uproar over Hyun."

The reason Korean companies were in turmoil was simple.

At Seungjeongwon, Chairman Barbara had dropped a huge bombshell. She announced that VH Company's President Kang Hyun would be entirely responsible for Barbara Group's investment direction in Korea.

Large corporations and even the Blue House would now need Hyun's advice.

"Tanya, what do you think will happen if Hyun gains more experience?"

"Chairman Barbara, if that happens, no one in Asia will be able to match him. However, I believe Hyun will try to avoid the spotlight."

"Avoid the spotlight, huh."

Considering Kang Hyun's past, it wasn't an incorrect statement. Despite excelling both in VH Company and classical music, he avoided showing himself. It was as if he were detached from worldly affairs.

At that moment, the night view of Seoul came into view outside the plane window.

"Tanya, doesn't it seem small?"

"Sorry?"

"To conceal Hyun, Korea seems smaller than ever."

Chairman Barbara smiled deeply at the night view of Seoul.
