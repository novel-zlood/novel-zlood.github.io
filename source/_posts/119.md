As the concertmaster nodded briefly, the principal oboist played the note 'A' for an extended duration.

While the members were busy tuning their instruments to the oboe's note, the concertmaster watched them with sharp eyes, adjusting the pitch.

The concertmaster's chair was higher than the others' to ensure his bow was always visible. His right hand essentially managed the entire string section.

"Heavy, but splendidly―!"

The concertmaster adjusted the timbre of the string section.

He created a nuanced sound by pressing the strings with the lower part of the bow.

Depending on the nature of the piece and the conductor’s direction, adjusting the nuanced sound was also the concertmaster's responsibility.

His cold eyes followed the members' bows. He could spot anyone with incorrect bow direction like a ghost and sharply pointed it out.

The reason Dmitri was so strict was due to the new members assigned to each section.

Hadn't someone said that an orchestra is like a war?

No matter how excellent a player is, it’s the same. Even if they have experience in another symphony orchestra, their status changes with a different stage.

The new members were as tense as freshly enlisted soldiers, partly because the heart of the London Symphony had yet to appear.

And then it happened.

All the members stood up simultaneously. Would you believe it if they said the air changed with one person's entrance?

Each of his steps seemed to echo Tchaikovsky's "Pathétique."

With the appearance of Spencer, the principal conductor of the London Symphony, the new members nervously licked their dry lips.

His gaze was so intense that they couldn't even look directly. Their eyes were fixed on just one spot.

Surely, the war would begin at the tip of that sharp baton.

"Maestro, thank you for your hard work."

Even after practice ended, Dmitri did not ask for the evaluation of the new members. The result was obvious. He, as the concertmaster, was not satisfied, so how could the conductor Spencer be?

An orchestra is something that needs to be slowly synchronized. But today, the Maestro was unusually calm.

Normally, he would have pointed his fingers together mid-conducting and shouted, "Cello―!" while glaring at the new member who made a mistake like a ghost.

"Are you already looking forward to it?"

"What do you mean, Dmitri?"

"Aren't you looking forward to Hyun's arrival? It's really not long now. The members are also excited to see Hyun again."

Spencer rubbed his nose without denying it. Honestly, he felt the same as the other members.

He was overjoyed when Kang Hyun chose London over Berlin first. After the recent solo recital, he became even more coveted.

"My long-time friend Spencer, may I come in for a moment?"

A familiar voice was heard beyond the conductor's room. The person who entered was Spencer's old friend and the crown prince of the British royal family.

Dmitri greeted Samuel familiarly. Although it was hard for the general public to see the crown prince's face, he often visited the London Symphony.

"What's the occasion? There's never enough time to care for the people's livelihood."

"Oh, I came running to give you a gift."

"A gift?"

Samuel handed over a gray newspaper. But it wasn't an English newspaper; it was in Korean.

As Spencer opened the newspaper, his puzzled eyes widened. He couldn't understand the content, but there was a huge headline with Hyun's face on it.

It depicted Hyun carrying his grandfather on his back, walking away from a chaotic accident scene.

"Samuel, what does this word mean?"

The first two characters were clearly Hyun's name. He remembered it from his visit to Korea. But he couldn't grasp the sentence that followed.

Samuel translated the sentence Spencer pointed to into English.

"HERO."

Brrring Brrring―!

These days, the phone rang more often than the cicadas' cries.

The reason was simple. One single photo. Could such a coincidence happen?

The media loves to exaggerate. Especially when a photo captures a scene of a burning car emitting dark clouds, and amid the chaos, a boy with a soot-streaked face carrying his grandfather on his back with one hand leading a tearful child. It was a picture worthy of the Pulitzer Prize.

"Ma'am, I'm sorry. You must be busy answering calls because of me."

"No, not at all. Kang Hyun did something praiseworthy. The chairman asked to unplug the phone for a while, so it should be fine for now."

The housekeeper's face was filled with pride.

All he did was carry an injured old man on his back, and the article's details were accurate. But the rumors had been exaggerated.

There were even claims that he tore open the car door with his bare hands to rescue people. He had to reassure his worried mother with all his might.

"Mom, it wasn't that dangerous. Driver Kim saw it too. The article became so big because the government wanted to divert attention towards me. With the economy in a slump, it was better to focus on a heroic act rather than report a chain collision on an 8-lane road."

"Still, Hyun, you mustn't get involved in such dangerous situations again. I'm so proud of you, but I'm also worried. Understand?"

"Yes, don't worry."

Both home and school were in an uproar. The occasional glances were more intense than before. Well, his face had been prominently featured in the newspaper.

But most looked at him with eyes full of admiration, which was quite burdensome.

"A hero award, huh."

During the school assembly, he stood on the stage and received a certificate from the principal for elevating the school's prestige.

He couldn't count how many photos he took with the teachers that day. Not even when he was accepted into the law department at Korea University was it this much.

"Hyun, shouldn't you change your name?"

"What do you mean, Noona?"

"Just look at these fan letters. You could rival Seo Taiji. I'm going to start calling you Kang Taiji."

Kim Mihyun joked. Since that day, the only difference was that he gained many fans who liked him, not just classical music.

Do you know the popularity of basketball players in the late '90s? Unexpectedly, fan letters flooded the gallery, knowing his affiliation.

Even Mihyun Noona, watching from the side, was amazed.

"Hyun, do you think you'll get a fan club?"

Mihyun Noona joked with a mix of seriousness. But considering the number of fan letters, it didn't seem impossible.

No, absolutely not. Such popularity is firmly declined. Moreover, short-lived popularity is like a bonfire that quiets down over time.

"For Hyun's sake, how about that for a fan club name?"

No, Noona!

"Oh my, our wonderful grandson-in-law is here―!"

Visiting Pyeongchang-dong with his grandfather after a long time, they were welcomed by Chairman Wang, who wore a white apron.

He looked like a perfect chef who could step into a Hong Kong movie with just a Chinese knife.

Im Hyera, the director, followed, looking exasperated.

"Son, what on earth are you wearing?"

"Haha, in-laws. They say a mother-in-law loves her son-in-law, but today I decided to cook a chicken for our wonderful grandson-in-law who did such an amazing thing."

"Son, if the company presidents saw you now, they'd be too shocked to speak."

Of course, within the Daeil Group, Chairman Wang was known for his unparalleled charisma.

In a documentary looking back at the history of the Daeil Group, all the company presidents unanimously said that Chairman Wang was as terrifying as a mafia boss.

"How does it taste? Does it suit your palate?"

It was samgyetang (ginseng chicken soup) simmered with various precious medicinal herbs. The cost must be incomparable to most foods.

Even with excellent ingredients, if the cook's skills are lacking, it’s all in vain. But with one big spoonful, his eyes widened. Chairman Wang's cooking skills were indeed remarkable.

"Father, your cooking is just as amazing as ever."

"Is it really that good?"

"Yes, Father. Even when I try to replicate it, I can never get it right."

Director Im Hyera was in awe.

She wasn't just saying it. Even she, who considered herself a gourmet, was astonished by the taste.

"Indeed, if I hadn't been in the wholesale business in North Hamgyong Province, I would have run a restaurant. When I first came to Seoul, I made this dish for your mother-in-law. Chickens were rare in the North. We mostly ate rabbits or pheasants, so when I made chicken soup, she loved it. I added gulisu (a medicinal herb) collected from the mountain ridges during winter to the broth for her weak body."

Who would have thought Chairman Wang's samgyetang had such a story? It was heartwarming.

At that moment, Chairman Wang looked at him with a peculiar expression.

"I only make this samgyetang for our 'family.' Isn't that right, daughter-in-law?"

"Of course, Father. I was also served this dish when I promised to marry Ilsung."

He unintentionally coughed. He almost choked. After taking a sip of water, he saw Director Im Hyera smiling.

It was clear they found amusement in teasing him.

After the meal, during tea time, Director Im Hyera stood up first.

"Hyun, are you going abroad during summer vacation?"

"Yes, I'll be in London and Berlin for a month. It's a great opportunity to meet renowned musicians and experience the world's top orchestras."

"You have so much talent. I hope you don't get taken away by someone else. In-law, shouldn't we hold the engagement ceremony soon?"

Chairman Wang joked, and his grandfather played along. Really, these two, who displayed such dignity at the company, turned mischievous when together.

Then it happened.

"Hyun, what are your plans for VH Company?"

"Sorry?"

"I heard from Secretary Kim that your business acumen is remarkable. They said you have the skills of an excellent conductor. While your uncle and aunt will likely sell their shares, the biggest shareholder, your eldest uncle, hasn't."

Sometimes Chairman Wang asked such sharp questions.

Though he had no interest in management, he promised his grandfather to protect Dongju.

But to fully protect Dongju, he needed his eldest uncle's shares.

Originally, his eldest uncle was meant to succeed Dongju, so the shares had been systematically gifted to him since childhood.

His grandfather sipped tea, perhaps to hide his bitter taste.

"For now, your eldest uncle will stay quiet because of Chairman Yoo. But in the future, it might turn into a management battle. A smart Hyun like you must know this."

Indeed, what use is blood over money? Especially for his eldest uncle, it was a process of pushing out the uninvited. Even the Daeil Group proved that money was thicker than blood.

In his past life, he knew how Son Ilsung took over the Daeil Group. After Chairman Wang's death, the first thing Son Ilsung did was oust his brother from the group.

"Hyun, how about a bet with your grandfathers?"

"A bet?"

"Yes, like before. Last time, the reward for the bet was a violin. This time, your grandfather and I will combine our efforts for the reward. But the problem will be more difficult."

Chairman Wang raised two fingers.

"Can you acquire all of Dongju's shares within the next two years?"
