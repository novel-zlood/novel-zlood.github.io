“Do you mean you want to recruit me?”

The Indian man with thick eyebrows looked at Manager Kim Sang-guk with curiosity.

“To be precise, it’s not recruitment but investment. As you know, our VH Company is an investment firm.”

“I don’t know how you found me, but do you know I’m still a university student?”

“Sanjay, we already know that you are a senior in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.”

Sanjay couldn’t understand the Asian man in front of him at all.

Although the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi is a prestigious university known as the MIT of India, he was still an undergraduate who hadn’t graduated yet.

At that moment, Manager Kim Sang-guk leaned forward and looked at Sanjay.

“Sanjay, have you ever thought about running your own IT business?”

“It’s not that I haven’t, but...”

“Then this is perfect. You can take this opportunity to receive full support from our VH Company.”

“W-Wait a moment.”

Sanjay gulped down a glass of water to quench his burning throat. The sound of the glass being placed down echoed as he looked at Manager Kim Sang-guk.

“Do you think I’m Bill Gates or something? I’ve heard of your company’s reputation. I know you invested in the Austrian Calvin Pharmaceutical Company and achieved significant success. But I can’t believe that such a competent investment firm would want to invest in someone as insignificant as me. Honestly, I doubt if you’re really an executive of VH Company or just a scammer.”

Manager Kim Sang-guk gave a short nod. It wasn’t the first time he had heard such words. Many young CEOs of venture companies had been wary of him.

Of course, he was offering a seemingly unbelievable contract with investment proposals.

“The quickest way to verify my identity would be to contact the headquarters of VH Company in South Korea. And we are offering you a fair contract.”

“A fair contract?”

“It may seem like an investment without returns at first glance, but if your business succeeds, it will be a different story. In short, our VH Company is buying your future.”

Hearing the phrase ‘buying the future,’ Sanjay’s throat bobbed noticeably.

How much time passed, Sanjay eventually picked up the documents and business card that Manager Kim Sang-guk had handed over and stood up.

Manager Kim Sang-guk knew for sure that he would be contacted again in less than a week.

“I wonder what our CEO is up to...”

Manager Kim Sang-guk thought of Kang Hyun while eating curry in New Delhi. It had been several months since he last saw his face.

All business approvals and instructions were conducted through emails and phone calls.

Did he find the work slow or unsatisfactory? Not at all, Kang Hyun’s investment strategies and directives were beyond the scope of an ordinary person. That was why Manager Kim Sang-guk stayed at VH Company and did not return to the strategic planning department.

“Is the next destination America?”

It was baffling how he managed to gather information on so many talents. The true nature of the Austrian Dream Company was evident.

Manager Kim Sang-guk stood up for his next destination. Who would be waiting for VH Company’s investment in America?

“I have to go buy the future.”

Buying the future, Manager Kim Sang-guk liked that phrase.

-Producer Kim, it's a hit!

The excited voice of the director echoed from the other end of the receiver.

Producer Kim Da-hyun couldn’t help but smile. The initially edited teaser video had caused a huge reaction nationwide.

Especially, the scene at the end of the teaser showing Kang Hyun sleeping was a big hit.

-There’s already a clamour from the higher-ups to extend it to three episodes. But will there be enough shooting time? It’s almost over.

Hadn’t a month already passed?

It felt like just yesterday they arrived in London, but the last day of shooting was gradually approaching.

He wanted to ask for an extension of the shooting period, but it wasn’t an easy task. It was uncertain whether Kang Hyun's agency and the Royal Academy of Music would permit it. However,

“Director, we can definitely produce three episodes with the current footage. Don’t worry!”

Producer Kim Da-hyun’s voice was full of confidence. Over the past month, while filming Kang Hyun, he had experienced unbelievable moments more than once.

Kang Hyun’s musical talent was truly unparalleled. Even those unfamiliar with classical music would be captivated by his talent.

“Senior, everything is ready!”

Just then, the assistant director’s voice came from beyond the door, signaling the end of the call.

Even as the call was ending, the director on the other end was shouting, “Kim Da-hyun, fighting!”

Producer Kim Da-hyun chuckled at the thought of hearing such a cheerful phrase from the director.

“Today’s destination is the London Symphony, right? Make sure to be fully prepared. Many great scenes will come out.”

“Isn’t that obvious? I’ve already prepared a few extra tapes compared to the existing footage. I’m dying to start shooting.”

“Hey, don’t mess around.”

Producer Kim Da-hyun’s face was filled with excitement and tension that had never been seen before.

‘It’s D-Day!’

It was the highlight of the scheduled shooting during the ‘one month’ short filming period.

Wasn’t today the day Kang Hyun visited the London Symphony?

It was intriguing to capture the orchestra rather than his life at the Royal Academy of Music, but that wasn’t the point. The current London Symphony had two legends waiting for Kang Hyun.

* * *

“Tommy, why are you shaking so much?”

Tommy’s face showed clear signs of nervousness. He couldn’t even answer Sabrina’s question immediately.

Upon arriving at the London Symphony Concert Hall, he was taking deep breaths as if his freckles might fall off.

“Sabrina, this is my dream place.”

It wouldn’t be just Tommy’s dream place. Many undergraduates at the Royal Academy of Music aspired to join the London Symphony.

But for an inexperienced rookie to join the major league London Symphony was more difficult than plucking a star from the sky.

“Really?”

On the other hand, Sabrina appeared uninterested in the orchestra. After all, wasn’t Sabrina someone who had played her own music even after entering the Royal Academy of Music? She lived a life far removed from typical musicians.

“Alright, let’s go in.”

At that moment, Kang Hyun took the lead and started walking. Tommy, Sabrina, and the filming crew cautiously followed him. As soon as Kang Hyun entered the concert hall, he encountered the members who were preparing for rehearsal.

The conductor was none other than Spencer, known as the heart of the London Symphony.

The three of them and the filming crew carefully took their seats in the audience. The members were engrossed in rehearsal, seemingly unaware of Kang Hyun’s arrival. Spencer was no different.

After the tuning was over, Spencer’s hand rose into the air, and numerous instruments began to create a single melody.

Producer Kim Da-hyun couldn’t close his mouth at the sheer awe of different instruments creating a harmonious sound together.

Wasn’t this the London Symphony, one of the world’s top orchestras? If he hadn’t come to London to film Kang Hyun, he would never have seen their rehearsal.

When Spencer’s baton sharply cut through the air and the trumpet sound reached the ceiling,

Spencer’s right hand made a straight line in the air and clenched into a fist.

At that moment, all the members stopped playing as if they had been waiting for that signal. Spencer turned around and looked towards the audience.

“Hyun!”

When Spencer called out to Kang Hyun,

“Do you know what went wrong?”

“Michael made a mistake at the beginning. It seemed like he didn’t put enough force on purpose. At the end of the second movement, Chloe, your bow direction was different from the other violists. It was momentary, but I noticed. And lastly, in the third movement, Maestro, you reversed the direction of your baton. That was a very obvious mistake.”

Kang Hyun solved Spencer’s puzzle as if he had been waiting for it. Both Tommy and Producer Kim Da-hyun were dumbfounded. Only Sabrina nodded as if she understood.

Tommy was still staring at Kang Hyun with wide eyes, not understanding the conversation between the two.

But as time passed, the essence of the conversation became clear. Could it be that Kang Hyun had pointed out all the mistakes the orchestra made during the rehearsal?

At that moment, Spencer turned back with a rare smile.

“Your skills haven’t rusted.”

* * *

“Did you capture that scene just now?”

At Producer Kim Da-hyun’s question, the assistant director and the cinematographer gulped and nodded.

Their eyes were filled with excitement. It was natural. A masterpiece had been born right from the start.

But there was a feeling that today wouldn’t end with just this one scene.

“Hyun, Maestro said he had to go to Austria for a while. He regretted that he couldn’t be here when you arrived.”

Spencer explained to Kang Hyun about Karas’s absence. Tommy and Producer Kim Da-hyun’s eyes briefly showed signs of disappointment.

Of course, anyone interested in classical music would know the fame of the legendary Karas. There weren’t many opportunities to meet a living legend up close.

“You two must be Tommy and Sabrina from the previous concert?”

“Yes, Maestro!”

Tommy exaggeratedly bowed, followed by Sabrina greeting Spencer. Spencer’s eyes were filled with interest.

Hadn’t he witnessed their skills firsthand at the previous concert? Like Kang Hyun, they were young prodigies.

“Maestro, I feel like I came too suddenly. I heard today was a day off, but I didn’t expect a rehearsal.”

“Today is indeed a day off.”

“Pardon?”

Spencer elaborated as he looked at the members seated on the stage.

“Hyun, everyone came to the concert hall even though it’s a day off because you were coming. Since we were all gathered anyway, we didn’t want to waste time, so we decided to rehearse. And it was also a good opportunity to check if your conducting skills have dulled.”

The members were looking at Kang Hyun. They all had a pleased expression like parents looking at their grown-up child.

It was only natural. Kang Hyun and the London Symphony members had long-standing bonds. At that moment,

“Why don’t you take the baton for old times’ sake?”

Spencer made an unexpected suggestion, looking at Kang Hyun.

“The members are already prepared.”

Producer Kim Da-hyun tried hard to swallow his surprise.

Which musician in the world could so easily receive the baton of the London Symphony? Even the notoriously proud members of the London Symphony were welcoming Kang Hyun.

His premonition wasn’t wrong. No, calling it a premonition wouldn’t do it justice.

As Kang Hyun smiled and received the baton, Producer Kim Da-hyun was certain that numerous masterpieces would be born from the London Symphony.
