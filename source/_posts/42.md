"Who was the most outstanding?"

It was the remark of a master. In front of the gathered maestros was a list of 12 violinists. The maestros' faces were full of contemplation. Moreover, weren't the broadcast cameras filming them?

"They are all outstanding violinists, it's hard to distinguish superiority."

It wasn't a wrong statement. These twelve were selected from thousands of violinists, so their skills were already as good as proven. Each one was talented enough to be called the next generation maestro representing their countries.

It was then.

"Even though I don't want to admit it, it must be that arrogant kid."

When Alexei spoke up, everyone focused on his voice, which was like scraping metal. It seemed everyone already knew who the arrogant kid was without further explanation.

"I agree with Mr. Alexei."

When China's maestro Deng Lun showed his agreement,

"I feel the same."

France's maestro Pierre Garnel nodded briefly. The other maestros felt the same. Though other participants were certainly excellent, Kang Hyun’s performance was something different. As if,

"It was like watching Paganini."

The violinist known for having sold his soul to the devil.

It wasn't about the unparalleled fast playing and flashy techniques. Rather, it was the slow tones that required one to imagine every musical phrase, something that couldn't be expressed without years of experience.

Moreover, the boy played those slow tones as if he was one with the violin.

"I hope he doesn't get bored easily."

Pierre Garnel showed a slightly worried expression. Weren't most geniuses like that? While they could immerse themselves madly into one thing, they also got bored quickly.

It had been said that he learned music for just a little over a month. So, who knows what would happen once he achieved his goal.

"Alexei, isn't this what you were worried about?"

At Pierre Garnel's question, Alexei nodded silently.

The reason he asked the boy a final question during the first round of judging was not much different from Pierre's concern. Without a reason to pursue music, the boy might someday put down the bow.

"But I think you can set aside your worries. Didn't you all see the boy's expression when he picked up the Stradivarius? It was an expression that could only come from a deep love for the violin."

It was similar to the look on the queen's face when she first pulled out "Joy" at Carnegie Hall.

It was a face of someone who loved the violin dearly. The sight of the black strings of the crimson soundboard caressing the boy’s cheek was enough to give one chills.

"Then, the first place in the second round of judging will go to number thirty-seven."

It was a unanimous decision.

PD Ria was filming their expressions silently.

Had the judges at the Queen Elisabeth Competition ever reached a unanimous decision before? As far as she knew, not even once. Each maestro had their own distinct musical values. Moreover,

"When the second round video is released, the music world will surely be abuzz."

No one could refute Alexei’s words.

***

Damn.

"Please unpack your luggage in the assigned rooms and gather back on the first floor."

Why did I have to get a room on the second floor?

At times like this, having a smaller body was quite inconvenient. I barely managed to drag my suitcase, which was as big as my body, up to the second floor.

Zhang Yan, with his seagull-like eyebrows, offered to help, but I refused. If I couldn't even do this much by myself, what could I do? Anyway,

"The scenery is amazing."

If a musician with an excellent sense of aesthetics had drawn a blueprint, it would look like this.

The white building shone like a jewel in the blazing sun, and the sounds of flora and fauna echoing from thousands of hectares of forest felt like musical notes on a staff.

Truly a sanctuary for violinists.

As I went back down to the first floor, I suddenly thought of my days at the judicial training institute.

"I am Zhang Yan from China. I played a Brahms piece in the second round."

It was the same back then; everyone was busy introducing themselves during the first hour after being assigned to their classes.

"Hyun?"

My train of thought was interrupted by Zhang Yan's small voice. It seemed it was my turn. Everyone’s eyes were on me.

"I am Kang Hyun from Korea. I played a Szymanowski piece in the second round."

Some people didn't know where Korea was, and there were still curious gazes about my identity. Moreover, when I said I played a Szymanowski piece in the second round, they were completely taken aback.

But what surprised them the most was probably my age.

"What, 14 years old? I thought you were less than 10."

The one who reacted most strongly was Eric from Northern Europe. With his appearance, it wouldn't be strange if he was holding an axe instead of a violin, being a descendant of Vikings. It was hard to imagine those giant hands playing the strings.

"I am from the Royal Academy of Music."

As the introductions turned into conversations about backgrounds, Joseph, proudly said,

"I played the violin at the Berlin University of the Arts."

Daniel Brühl, who had been taught by the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic, countered. Next was,

"Um, I am studying at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory."

It was Anna from Russia. Contrary to the rough Russian accent of Alexei, she had a similar small stature to mine, long platinum blonde hair, and striking green eyes. Her voice was as tiny as an ant's, perhaps due to her introverted personality.

And somehow,

‘Again, me?’

Everyone’s eyes were on me again. They seemed curious about my background.

They must have been wondering where this foreign kid with a violin had learned to play. Names of famous music schools like Juilliard in the USA, International Conservatory of Shanghai, and Verdi in Italy must have been running through their heads.

I didn't want to disappoint their expectations, but,

"Daeseong Middle School."

Oh well, whatever.

"Maestro?"

Dmitry's eyes were filled with curiosity. The reason was simple. Spencer, the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, was glaring with his eyes wide open. Moreover, he was holding a newspaper tightly. It had been a long time since he held anything other than a score.

"He finally entered Chappelle."

With just a few words, Dmitry understood immediately.

"Could it be that boy from back then?"

When Spencer smiled faintly, Dmitry’s icy eyes shook. It was unbelievable. Where was Chappelle? It was the dream place for any violinist. He never imagined the boy would head straight to Chappelle.

"Dmitry, you have experience too, right?"

Dmitry nodded briefly. He too had been called a prodigy in his time. And come to think of it,

"Maestro, weren't you also at Chappelle?"

"Indeed, I was."

Of course, he didn't just experience it. Spencer had even won the grand prize.

Spencer closed his eyes as if reminiscing about the past. Though it was decades ago, his days at Chappelle were still vivid as if it were yesterday.

"Dmitry, do you know the legend of that place?"

"How could I not?"

There was a long-standing legend among violinists: Chappelle, with its endless melodies, was where the god of music resided.

It was said that the god of music would appear at dawn to those chosen.

Some said it was merely a tale to inspire violinists' ambition.

"That kid might make it possible."

What could this mean?

"Maestro?"

"The god of music."

It was just a fanciful legend. But looking into Spencer’s determined eyes, Dmitry felt he wasn’t lying. Rather, Spencer was filled with excitement. Dmitry swallowed hard.

No way.

Spencer silently smirked.

"I have a question."

It was late at night when the lights were out. I was heading to the kitchen on the first floor because I was thirsty, and someone was following me. When I turned my head swiftly, I saw the British gentleman standing there. He had been staring at me since morning without saying a word.

"What?"

There was a mix of complex emotions in the British gentleman’s eyes.

"How do you play the violin like that?"

He looked like he was about to cry. It seemed my previous performance had left a strong impression on him.

How should I explain this? In my previous life at the judicial training institute, I often saw prodigies crying out of frustration.

"I don't know, I just played as my heart led me."

It was an undeniable truth. I couldn't explain how such musical talent had come to me. I just felt my heart burn passionately when I played the violin.

At that moment,

"I kept thinking of you. When I played the violin, your performance wouldn't leave my mind!"

The British gentleman, William, vented his frustration at me. I didn’t know why he was acting like this at night.

I wanted to tell him to do as he pleased, but there were many cameras watching. They had said it was for a documentary, and there were observation cameras installed throughout the mansion like CCTV. In a way, I could use this to build my image.

"I'll help you."

William's eyes trembled as if there was an earthquake. There was nothing I couldn't help with. It was just a matter of watching William's performance a few times, as I had guided Park Sun-young.

Of course, it was something to do after the competition. I had to put out the urgent fire first. It was then.

"Hic."

Huh?

William’s body leaned on me as if collapsing. Damn, what is this now?

***

Anna, the Russian violinist, couldn’t sleep even though it was night. Chappelle was eerily quiet.

Only the occasional sound of insects and the rustling of leaves in the wind could be heard like a melody.

"I'm hungry..."

Was it because she had been too nervous?

Being with strangers, she had eaten less dinner than usual. Her stomach was growling incessantly.

Anna cautiously opened the door and headed to the kitchen. She had seen earlier that the refrigerator was full of food.

As she thought about spreading butter on toast, her eyes caught a faint white object.

‘What is that?’

She squinted, and the object became clearer. In the dim light from the refrigerator, she saw a man and a woman hugging each other.

Gasp!

Anna involuntarily held her breath. At that moment, she made eye contact with the short woman. The woman's eyes were filled with embarrassment.

Anna felt her heart pounding, as if she had seen something she shouldn't have. But no matter how she thought about it, there was no woman in Chappelle who was similar in height to her.

Then,

"Hyun?"
