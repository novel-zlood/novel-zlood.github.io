Gang Hyun Concerto for Two Violins.

The face of Austin, the representative of EMA, clearly showed his intense emotion. His hands were clenched tightly as if he might burst into tears at any moment.

The reason for his unusual display of emotion was simple. The recorded melody was incredibly beautiful.

Of course, it wasn’t as moving as the live performance, but the melody by Kang Hyun and Hirose was captivating enough.

Gang Hyun Violin Concertos No.7

Kang Hyun's solo performance was reminiscent of the reincarnation of Niccolò Paganini. Stradivarius's dazzling and complex techniques, along with Baek Jeonghoon's accompaniment, had the power to make listeners dizzy.

No matter how hard Austin tried to follow the notes on the staff, it was beyond his ability.

As the resonance of the strings continued, Austin felt more and more like he was falling into an inescapable swamp, chasing the melody.

“This is driving me crazy.”

Austin licked his dry lips. Even though the recorded performance had ended, he still felt a lingering echo enveloping his body. His hands were sweaty.

The clock’s hands had already made a full turn, showing that quite a bit of time had passed.

Austin's throat bobbed noticeably. He could understand why religious people in the past claimed Niccolò Paganini was a devil. To shake a person's heart so profoundly...

“Maria, by now, this tape should have reached Germany, right?”

“Yes, sir. We have received information that they are also checking the tape at Deutsche.”

“This is truly something unprecedented.”

Austin looked down at the small tape and shook his head.

When he visited Korea before, Kang Hyun did not choose either Deutsche or EMA. Suddenly, he sent this demo tape.

“Evaluate my worth.”

It was a bold and ingenious comment.

EMA and Deutsche had certainly made significant marks in the history of classical music recording and albums.

Many people had approached the representatives of these two companies over the years, but it was the first time someone of Kang Hyun’s caliber had extended his hand first.

Some might think it was arrogant, but after listening to the recorded tape, their thoughts would undoubtedly change 180 degrees.

Deutsche’s representative, Simon Brühl, would surely think the same.

“Sir, I believe Deutsche will keep the contract amount confidential. How should we handle the contract terms?”

“There’s no need to find out Deutsche’s contract amount.”

“Pardon?”

After hearing Kang Hyun’s melody, Austin no longer cared about money. It felt as if he had found the ideal place he had been searching for since childhood.

As Kang Hyun continued his solo performances, his melodies grew endlessly. Austin was immensely curious about how far this growth could go.

“Send a blank contract, including the contract amount. We are willing to meet any conditions they desire, whether it’s money or terms.”

Austin’s eyes followed Kang Hyun beyond the tape.

“Is there any student who would like to express their opinion on the disproportionality of punishment?”

The common liberal arts course for first-year students was Modern Law and Society, offered by the law department.

At the old professor’s question, the students remained silent like mute fish. It was a rather difficult question for students majoring in German, and even for first-year law students who were still novices.

Then, someone raised their hand.

“Oh, go ahead.”

Kang Hyun stood up, receiving the attention of the entire room. Although he wasn’t the type to step forward, this was a class offered by the law department. Moreover, the old professor’s question was similar to the interview in the third stage of the bar exam in his previous life.

“The law is merely a tool crafted by human hands. Just as objects made by humans can have defects, so can laws, and there will always be people who exploit those flaws. As there are a hundred thoughts for a hundred people, and ten thousand thoughts for ten thousand people, if a judge has a biased perspective instead of a correct one, the judgment will undoubtedly change.”

“So, you're saying a court’s ruling is not an eternal truth?”

“Yes, a court’s ruling can change at any time, which is why legal systems like retrials and appeals exist.”

The old professor gave a satisfied smile, his eyes sparkling as if he had caught a big fish.

However, the old professor’s eyes soon filled with curiosity when he checked the attendance sheet.

He couldn’t have imagined that such an excellent legal answer could come from a student who wasn’t even in the law department.

Just then, the sound signaling the end of the first period rang from the speakers attached to the ceiling.

“Wow, the top student really is different—!”

Kim Daewoo exclaimed loudly, putting his arm around Kang Hyun’s shoulder.

Kang Hyun was already a well-known figure at Korea University. He was the subject of everyone’s attention from the moment he entered.

His outstanding performance in classes left not only the students but sometimes even the professors in awe.

“Hyun, what are you having for lunch?”

“Sorry, but I can’t eat with you today. I have a prior engagement.”

“Could it be a girl?”

Kim Daewoo asked with wide eyes, but Kang Hyun only smiled faintly.

After parting ways with Kim Daewoo, he headed straight to a snack bar near the side gate, where someone was already waiting.

“Oh, junior—!”

Manager Kim Sangguk put down the fork he was using to eat tteokbokki and greeted him.

Who would have thought that Kim Sangguk was an alumnus of the German department at Korea University? He had become a direct junior.

The reason Kim Sangguk had sought out Kang Hyun early in the morning was simple.

“This is the investment report based on the plan you wrote earlier.”

“You suddenly started using formal language?”

“We have to distinguish between public and private matters, don’t we, sir?”

A rare smile spread across Kim Sangguk’s face. Working with Kang Hyun always seemed to make adrenaline surge through his body.

It was understandable because Kang Hyun’s blueprints were coming together like puzzle pieces.

Initially, investing in insignificant IT companies didn’t make sense, but within a year, the companies Kang Hyun mentioned were all making their mark.

Anyone who didn’t know would have thought Kang Hyun was a fortune teller.

Eating tteokbokki in a shabby snack bar while skimming through the report, Kang Hyun was like an investment genius.

His ingenious and groundbreaking investment plans were something Kim Sangguk, who had worked at Daeil Group for decades, was seeing for the first time.

If one were to describe Kang Hyun in one phrase, it would be this:

‘The Midas touch.’

Kang Hyun quickly skimmed through the thick report. Since his days as a prosecutor’s assistant, speed-reading thick reports had become a habit.

At that moment, he met the gaze of Manager Kim Sangguk, who was looking at him strangely.

“What are you staring at?”

“I’m just amazed at how successful my junior is.”

“Is the work report finished? If so, shall we go for lunch?”

At that moment, Kim Sangguk called out for two more servings of tteokbokki with extra liver in the sundae.

“Junior, today’s lunch is on me!”

“Ms. Mihyun, did you receive this offer from Germany?”

Chairwoman Im Hyera looked at the contract proposal from Deutsche and shook her head.

It seemed Deutsche was determined to go all out. It was one of the two leading classical labels, along with EMA.

The contract amount and terms offered to Kang Hyun were so good that even most maestros would find it hard to receive such a deal.

“We received a call from Deutsche early this morning. They seemed to want to contact you directly, but I believe they will call again after lunch. The caller introduced himself as Simon Brühl from Deutsche. Is that correct?”

“Simon Brühl? The representative of Deutsche?”

Im Hyera let out a hollow laugh. She hadn’t expected the representative of the proud classical label to call personally.

No wonder they had seemed quite anxious when they attended the solo performance. With EMA as their rival, it was understandable.

At that moment,

“Also, the contract proposal from EMA just arrived a moment ago.”

Im Hyera’s eyes widened as she checked EMA’s contract proposal. It was a blank form.

She knew what a blank proposal meant. Moreover, there was a handwritten letter from EMA’s representative, Austin, enclosed.

The content of the letter was simple. All conditions would be tailored to Kang Hyun's wishes, except for the initial stock amount, which EMA would decide.

“How many copies do they plan to prepare?”

Seeing the numbers in the letter, Im Hyera reread it several times, unable to believe her own eyes.

It was an era when famous domestic singers sold a million copies of their hit albums. But compared to the initial stock for Kang Hyun's album, those numbers seemed trivial.

Indeed, even in Korea, considered barren land for classical music, there were many fans eagerly waiting for Kang Hyun's album. Moreover, it was said that Kang Hyun's first album, released years ago, was being used as prenatal music among mothers.

“If the second album is released, it will undoubtedly create a syndrome.”

Im Hyera predicted the future as if she were making a prophecy.

Tak—

The sound of a Go stone being placed was crisp.

Chairman Wang narrowed his eyes, staring intently at the Go board.

Though he had improved significantly under the guidance of a national Go player, he still couldn’t beat Kang Hyun.

“You’re playing with full effort now, unlike before?”

“Grandfather, your skills have improved so much. If I go easy on you like before, I might lose.”

“You cheeky boy.”

The intense battle on the top left and right corners of the Go board resembled the fierce competition in company management. A single lazy move could result in being overtaken by an opponent who could see several moves ahead.

“By the way, is it true that you lose bets sometimes?”

“Me, lose?”

“Don’t you remember the bet we made years ago? You said you would acquire all of Dongju’s shares before turning nineteen. Why was it difficult even with the help of Manager Kim, who is quite a capable piece?”

It was understandable. Acquiring a large company's shares at a high school age was nearly impossible.

Moreover, his uncle Yoo Beomjin, despite losing some influence, was still a formidable figure. He wouldn’t easily give up his assets.

At that moment,

“Grandfather, what do you think happens when you try to take everything from someone who has already lost a lot? Even a mouse will bite a cat when cornered. Preventing such a disaster is the mark of a true manager, isn’t it?”

“A true manager?”

“Uncle has not only been demoted but also lost his standing within Dongju. The executives who once thought of him as their lifeline have all turned their backs on him. If I try to take the remaining shares from him now, he will become a cornered mouse.”

Kang Hyun continued to place stones on the Go board as he spoke.

“So, I approached him discreetly. By now, he probably thinks VH Company is a foreign company trying to take over Dongju. He initially resisted, but after learning that I had bought shares from Aunt and Uncle, he accepted. He now believes that the only way to get back at Dongju is for VH Company to buy his shares and take control.”

Chairman Wang’s throat bobbed. Though stones were continuously being placed on the Go board, his attention was more on Kang Hyun’s story.

“Recently, Uncle himself expressed his intention to sell his shares. He has no idea that VH Company is actually me. It took longer than expected to absorb the remaining shares.”

Chairman Wang looked at Kang Hyun with a satisfied smile.

He had thought that Kang Hyun was being overly sentimental toward his uncle, but he wasn’t. Instead of blindly taking everything, he had meticulously calculated every move with cold precision, worthy of admiration.

At that moment, Kang Hyun added,

“By the way, you know that I’m not yet nineteen years old, right? I believe the contractual age is recorded in full years.”

He was not there to collect the bet's reward as a student but stood as a mature manager.
