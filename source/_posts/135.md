-The timing for the release is not good.

The evaluation from the investment group was sharp.

-Blockbuster-level movies are being released at this time.

-Of course, I heard that Director Philip's disaster movie is being released at the same time.

-No matter how interesting it is, it’s still just a musical movie, isn’t it?

No matter how great a masterpiece was made, the commercial viability of a movie themed around music had clear limitations at that time. There was much talk about delaying the release, like hiding from a typhoon temporarily.

However, Director Jean-Pierre firmly shook his head.

"It's not too late to decide after seeing the reactions from critics and journalists at the preview."

Jean-Pierre's eyes were filled with unwavering conviction. Critics, journalists, and even professors from Juilliard's music school attended the preview.

But even so, the audience was noticeably sparse compared to other preview venues.

The reason was simple. Although Director Jean-Pierre's debut work, “La Vie en Rose,” was recognized for its artistic value, it had not yet been acknowledged for its commercial success.

Most journalists and critics probably headed to the previews of the blockbusters scheduled at the same time.

"I hope you have a good time."

Since it was a press preview that also served as a technical screening, the stage greeting was simple.

The faces of the journalists who did not have high expectations began to change as the movie started.

Zzing.

Everyone held their breath in tune with Paganini's bow strokes. The movie's immersion and control were on par with, if not superior to, blockbuster-level films.

It gave a different kind of thrill. Throughout the screening, critics and journalists could not take their eyes off the screen.

The reaction from the Juilliard music school professors was the same. They might have thought it was presumptuous to make a music movie about Paganini.

Who could dare to revive Paganini's melodies? But then.

Gulp―!

Surely, if Paganini were alive, he would have presented such melodies. The throats of the Juilliard music school professors were visibly moving.

No one could get up from their seats until the end credits finished rolling.

Everyone in the audience felt it simultaneously. This movie would be a huge hit. Journalists, critics, and even the Juilliard music school professors had many questions for Jean-Pierre.

Eventually, an elderly professor from Juilliard's music school got the first chance to speak.

"Director, how did you restore Paganini's melodies?"

Was it a hasty question? The name Paganini was heavy even among musicians. But the same curiosity was evident in the eyes of the other professors as well.

Jean-Pierre thought of the making film and said to them.

"It's simple."

"Pardon?"

"Because young Paganini played it himself."

Surely, when they see the making film, they will experience another wave of chills.

"Ma'am, isn't this soup too bland?"

How could she not know that her own taste was salty? The housekeeper repeatedly apologized for my aunt's complaints.

Isn't it a sight that makes you frown? If Grandfather were healthy, he would have hit Aunt on the forehead with a ladle.

"Jinseok hyung."

"Huh?"

"When are you going to stop coming to Ichon-dong?"

I asked after finishing my meal and calling Yujinseok. But there was no answer in return.

Of course, how could this young kid know? He was just a puppet moving according to his parents' will.

Anyway, didn't Aunt's and Uncle's families come to Ichon-dong a few times a week, as if they were stamping attendance?

‘Tsk.’

They must be scared that Grandfather might suddenly wake up.

But as the weeks went by with no improvement in Grandfather's condition, Aunt and Uncle seemed rather relieved.

Now they seemed to be holding a strategy meeting in the living room on what to do next.

Father once made a fuss, but it was not very effective. It was then.

"Hyunja, you come here for a moment too."

Aunt called Mother, who was in the kitchen. It happened just when Father was away. I had to fill Father's empty seat. But Aunt and Uncle did not look pleased to see me.

"Hyunja, isn't it hard to take care of Father?"

"Yes, Hyunja, seeing you take care of him alone makes your oppas feel bad."

"I'll send a caregiver when I have time. Hyunja, you should take a break now. You can go out with Kang sometimes when you have time. Kang doesn't look well, probably because he's always at the company."

Oh, look at this?

If anyone saw it, they would think they had coordinated their lines. Since when did they care about their youngest sibling to say such things?

Their intention to hire a caregiver was the same. They wanted to plant someone inside Ichon-dong. They wanted to monitor every move.

Their gall was growing bolder. If Grandfather were healthy, they wouldn't be able to come and go from Ichon-dong as they pleased.

It was then.

“Aunt and oppas, isn't this too much?"

Mother was angry. Without having to say more, it was clear why Mother was angry. Although she was not worldly, she could not help but know Aunt's and Uncle's dark intentions.

"Do you really care about Father?"

"No, Hyunja. How can you not understand our feelings? We want to hire a caregiver because we are worried about you, but if you react like this, what do you expect us to do?"

"If it weren't for Uncle, Father wouldn't have collapsed like this. If you had any conscience, you would at least show some remorse, but every time you come to Ichon-dong, you keep talking about Father passing away!"

It was the first time I had seen Mother so angry in my entire life. The saying that a woman's anger can bring frost even in the hottest summer was perfectly fitting. Mother's eyes were colder than ever.

Of course, wasn't she Grandfather's favorite child? In the end, Mother firmly stood up, saying there was no need for a caregiver, leaving them with embarrassed expressions.

"Jinseok."

I went upstairs and called Yujinseok. Perhaps because he remembered getting a beating from me, he always found me intimidating. He looked completely deflated when I suddenly spoke informally.

But who am I? Haven't I been a prosecutor for a long time and even prepared to become a congressman? I had spent my entire life dealing with people. How could I not handle this young kid?

"You will be my eyes."

First, I needed to plant a black box within that group.

"To America?"

Kim Sang-guk looked puzzled. Of course, he hadn't expected his first business trip to come so soon. Moreover, being suddenly asked to go to America was bewildering.

"You will go with me."

"With you?"

"I was invited to the premiere of a movie being released in America. Didn't I tell you before? Around this time last year, I participated in the simultaneous recording of a music movie."

But he still seemed puzzled.

"Didn't you say you were going to make a lot of money?"

"I have to make a lot of money."

"So why are we going to America? It can't be just because of the premiere. If it's about investment, you could send me alone."

He was right. If I went to seek investment with my young appearance, I would surely be rejected. No matter how much Americans value money, appearances still matter.

Who would trust a high school student who isn't even a college student? Maybe for a movie, it could work.

Moreover, I didn't have enough money to invest yet.

"Mr. Kim, you know exactly how much wealth I have, right?"

"You took on accounting duties at the gallery, didn't you? I have a rough idea. Do you want me to tell you the exact amount?"

"No, I already know it."

It was a considerable amount for my age, enough to be called a windfall. The royalties were quite substantial.

Not to mention my ticket power. If I held another solo concert, it would sell out even faster than before.

But.

"That's not enough."

Dongju Chemical was already a leading company in the chemical industry. Moreover, the development speed and value of graphene were increasing day by day.

In other words, it was a continuously rising stock. So, the assets I had were far from sufficient. It was like trying to catch a moving train.

But there was a way.

"The war has begun, so now I need to make bullets."

"I'm curious about what method you have in mind."

Calling it bullets might sound demeaning, but it couldn't be helped. I couldn't reveal the exact amount here.

If my memory from my past life was correct, it would be the next round. It was covered extensively in newspapers and topics, so I couldn't forget it.

How could I remember so precisely? Wasn't software incredibly advanced? I could almost remember the number of anchovies I had for lunch.

"I have a first method to make a large sum of money."

* * *

The grand mansion in Pyeongchang-dong, surrounded by red brick walls like a fortress, was bustling early in the morning with planting activities.

Chairman Wang never spared money when it came to buying old trees and landscape trees, as seen in the country club in Gapyeong. It was said that the cost of the landscape trees in the grand mansion in Pyeongchang-dong was more expensive than most other mansions.

"Father, aren't you going to Ichon-dong today?"

"I went there yesterday. Today, I will just immerse myself in the view of the palm trees."

"Is Chairman Yoo still unwell?"

Chairman Wang nodded silently. Far from being unwell, they had chatted for so long the previous day that they lost track of time.

Only the housekeeper knew, and the children were completely unaware.

At that moment, a man in a suit walked up from beyond the garden.

"You're here, Mr. Kim."

"Hello, Mr. Kim."

Kim Sang-guk first bowed to Chairman Wang and then greeted Im Hyera.

As the perceptive Im Hyera stepped aside, Chairman Wang walked among the landscape trees. To have a secret conversation, they needed a place like this.

Looking at the lush landscape trees, it felt like being in an arboretum.

"Mr. Kim, how was it when you met Hyun?"

"He was unshaken by any wind."

"Unshaken by any wind?"

Kim Sang-guk nodded without hesitation.

As the saying goes, if you see one thing, you can infer ten things. The more he talked with Kang Hyun, the more Kim Sang-guk was amazed.

Sometimes it felt like he was talking not to a seventeen-year-old but to a peer or someone with even more experience.

"Chairman, it might be presumptuous, but I've met countless people in my position as the head of the strategy planning office. Of course, compared to you, it's nothing, but I thought I was good at reading people. However, meeting Kang Hyun made me realize that was a vain conceit."

As the saying goes, there's always someone better. Kang Hyun fit that description perfectly.

Among all the people he had seen in the strategy planning office, Kang Hyun's planning and execution skills were unmatched. Moreover, his ideas were extraordinary.

"He's going to America?"

"Yes, Chairman."

"Why America all of a sudden?"

It made sense if it was for a movie premiere, but the timing wasn't right. If it was about investment, he could just send Kim Sang-guk alone.

But Kim Sang-guk hesitated before speaking.

"Actually, Kang Hyun added one more condition."

"A condition?"

"He said we could report trivial conversations or impressions to the outside, but we must keep all contract and business details confidential."

At that moment, Chairman Wang laughed as if he had been waiting for this. His laughter was so hearty that it made the palm tree leaves seem to dance.

It was as if Kang Hyun's words were aimed directly at Chairman Wang. Despite his young age, Kang Hyun was trying to make Kim Sang-guk his man, step by step.

Chairman Wang turned his head to look at the landscape trees without asking any more questions.

"Looking at these palm trees reminds me of Hyun. Do you know the flower language of the Washingtonia palm?"

Since it was an imported landscape tree, the flowers bloomed late. Moreover, it was difficult to grow in Seoul, but Chairman Wang had managed to cultivate it with added lighting. Looking at the flowers of the Washingtonia palm that he had nurtured with great effort, Chairman Wang added one more thing.

"Conquest."

With a subtle smile, Chairman Wang walked away. He was curious to see how far that child's hands would reach.
