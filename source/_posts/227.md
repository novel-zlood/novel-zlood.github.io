"Oppa...?"

As Yooha's lips curled up, her eyes showed a hint of disbelief. It was only natural since someone who was supposed to be in England suddenly appeared in New York.

When Kang Hyun responded with a smile and a brief nod, Yooha's eyes welled up with tears.

"Y-Yooha?"

A bewildered voice escaped Kang Hyun's lips. He had never imagined that the Ice Queen would tear up.

Kang Hyun quickly pulled the car over to the side of the road and turned to look at Yooha. It was then.

Grab.

Yooha spread her arms and wrapped them around Kang Hyun's neck, bursting into tears. She no longer looked like the Ice Queen but a normal seventeen-year-old girl.

Of course, it must have been incredibly tough for her to live alone in a foreign country at such a young age. Kang Hyun had experienced homesickness in his past life.

Kang Hyun silently comforted Yooha. Surely, a mix of complex emotions was brewing inside her heart.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes!"

Who knows how long she cried? Yooha, who had cried so much that she could now be called the Ice Crybaby instead of the Ice Queen, nodded with a bashful smile.

Growl.

Yooha grabbed her stomach with an embarrassed expression. She seemed to be hungry after shedding so many tears.

Kang Hyun smiled knowingly and started driving again.

"Oppa, have you been to New York often?"

"Huh?"

"How do you know your way around so well?"

Yooha asked curiously as she watched Kang Hyun skillfully drive towards 5th Avenue.

Kang Hyun had lived in New York for quite a long time in his past life. Even though his memories were faint, his body seemed not to lie, as he navigated through shortcuts.

"Uh, where is this?"

"Restaurant Vermia. I made a reservation in advance to have dinner with you, Yooha."

For a moment, Yooha's eyes sparkled with childlike happiness.

It was understandable since Restaurant Vermia was famous for being difficult to book. Especially Vermia's pasta and steak were renowned in New York's Michelin Guide. Because of that, it was known to be hard to get a reservation even a month in advance.

"Since Vermia opened in 1917, the steak is prepared with a sauce recipe passed down through generations. It's medium-rare, and the steak's origin is..."

Kang Hyun had visited this place several times in his past life. The only difference this time was that the chef's attention seemed different.

Not only did the chef serve the food directly, but he also explained it personally, a task usually done by the manager. The executive chef was doing it himself.

"Oppa, do they usually do this?"

"Usually, the manager explains, or if requested, the chef might come out, but I don't remember asking for it specially."

It was somewhat overwhelming. But the taste of the food was as delightful as any Michelin-starred restaurant.

He wanted to pair the meal with a glass of wine, but he had to drive, and it wouldn't be right to drink in front of a high school student.

Reluctantly, he had to settle for sparkling water to cleanse his palate.

After the meal,

Again?

Sure enough, the chef personally brought out and served the dessert.

"This is a dessert made with my heart. I've put special care into it, so please enjoy it to your heart's content. If you don't mind, may I ask a favor as a fervent fan of Kang Hyun?"

The chef, with an impressive mustache, cautiously pulled out an album and a marker pen from his pocket. Since the tables were quite spread out in this private restaurant, no other patrons could see the chef's actions or words.

Kang Hyun smiled and signed the album handed over by the chef. The chef's mustache quivered with emotion as he showed an overwhelmingly moved expression.

The events of that day didn't end there.

"Hyun?"

Just as they were about to leave after settling the bill,

"Matthew?"

It was Matthew, the vocalist of the then-new band Iris, for whom Kang Hyun had done composing and producing in the past.

Matthew, now part of a renowned band that had taken the U.S. and Europe by storm, warmly embraced Kang Hyun.

"When did you come to New York? If you had contacted me, I would have come to greet you!"

"If I had contacted Matthew, we'd be drinking in a pub by now instead of a restaurant. I was planning to reach out after finishing my errands."

"Did you come to New York for another band's producing? It's too much, Hyun! I begged you to produce for us again, but you didn't even listen!"

Though Matthew said this, he couldn't hide his delighted smile. Then, he noticed Yooha standing next to Kang Hyun and asked.

"Hyun's girlfriend?"

Kang Hyun chuckled and nodded.

"A violinist named Hyun is in New York?"

At a quiet suburban mansion, middle-aged men were gathered, sipping wine.

Though they were a diverse group, they were all renowned Hollywood directors.

Upon someone's inquiry, a bald director nodded and said,

"He arrived in New York a few days ago. I'm planning to ask Hyun to compose for my next film."

"Marker, what are you talking about? I was planning to ask him first!"

"Both of you are dreaming. Hyun hasn't worked in Hollywood for years. Do you think no one has asked him to work since then? Many have, but they all got rejected."

It was unbelievable. Who were these people? They were all famous Hollywood directors, known for their high status and prestige. Many in the film industry dreamt of working with them.

Of course, Hollywood wasn't a place where anyone could just ask for work.

However, Kang Hyun had consistently declined their requests. Then,

"I also plan to propose a project to Hyun."

James Cameron, who was sitting at the head of the table, quietly spoke. The other directors looked at Cameron with astonished expressions.

"Cameron, really?"

"Why, is it strange?"

"No, it's just unusual for someone as meticulous as you to propose a project to anyone."

It wasn't wrong. James Cameron's reputation was immense, even among the distinguished directors present.

His filmography was so impressive that he was called the father of masterpieces.

For someone like him, proposing a project to anyone was rare. Even Hollywood's top actors had to audition in front of him.

"The reason I'm here today is simple. I thought you all would also propose projects to Hyun. If several directors approach him simultaneously, he might reject all of us as usual. He's not an ordinary musician."

"Cameron, I agree with you."

"Indeed, an ordinary musician would have been grateful and bowed down at our proposals. But given Hyun's past actions, he might feel overwhelmed and leave New York."

Everyone seemed to agree with James Cameron.

Treating Hyun as an ordinary musician could ruin everything.

Finally, they understood why James Cameron, who usually didn't attend social gatherings, was present today.

"So, how about we invite Hyun to our gathering?"

"Invite?"

"Yes, let's invite him and gauge his intentions here. It's better than working behind the scenes."

Though it seemed like a casual meeting of middle-aged men, it was one of Hollywood's most prestigious social gatherings.

It wasn't a place anyone could just decide to join. The influence of the directors in the social group often played a significant role, similar to the co-op admission process in Central Park.

For example, a famous Hollywood actress once wanted to join their gathering but was flatly rejected. But this time was different.

With someone's outcry,

"I'm in!"

"Me too!"

"Let's invite Hyun and ask him directly. I'd love to meet him in person too!"

Thus, Kang Hyun's invitation was unanimously decided.

* * *

Just as Kang Hyun was getting used to life in New York, an unexpected invitation arrived.

"Hollywood's leading directors..."

Kang Hyun couldn't believe it as he headed to the suburban mansion. He never imagined that famous Hollywood directors would invite him to a social gathering.

Nervous? Of course. These were people he couldn't meet even if he wanted to in his past life. But,

'I have a date today.'

He had a date with Yooha scheduled for that day. He planned to pick her up after the gathering.

Though he wanted to bring Yooha, he couldn't ask her to skip school. As his thoughts deepened, the car arrived at the mansion.

"Nice to meet you, Hyun."

"Hyun, nice to meet you. You're even more handsome in person."

"Marker, you're right. He has a face as versatile as DiCaprio's. He's not just a violinist but could be an actor too."

It was a dizzying first meeting. The eccentric directors greeted him and then continued their conversation as if appraising him.

It didn't feel bad. After all, it was all compliments.

Then, James Cameron, whom he had seen in famous award shows like the Oscars, approached Kang Hyun.

"Hyun, I hope you don't feel bad. Given our professions, we all have a peculiar habit of assessing people. They mean no harm."

"It's fine, Director. I'm actually grateful for such a warm welcome."

"Thank you for saying that. Honestly, I'm excited to see you in person rather than on screen. You know I've written a screenplay with you in mind."

Other directors widened their eyes at Cameron's words. They thought he was there to propose a film score, but he mentioned a screenplay.

James Cameron quickly added, fearing others might steal his thunder.

"I want to make a musical film with you as the protagonist."

At that moment,

"Cameron, waitâ€•!"

"Cameron, are you really going to play dirty?"

"Hyun, before you consider Cameron's offer, please hear us out."

Other directors hurriedly approached Kang Hyun.

Kang Hyun was unfamiliar with such a situation. He never imagined that directors, not musicians, would be so eager for him.
