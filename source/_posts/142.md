“Is this report true?”

Eyes of amber color shook as if an earthquake had occurred.

“Wasn’t this analyzed multiple times?”

“A total of three analyses were conducted.”

“There was no problem analyzing the epicenter, right? This purity is truly unbelievable―!”

Barbara’s cheek twitched violently. It was proof of how excited he was, as he usually showed no change in expression.

It was understandable, as the exploration team’s report on the survey area was astonishing. Especially the purity of the strange gold extracted from the epicenter was unbelievably high.

“They say they’re repeatedly conducting geological surveys radially across the exploration area. Kellik must be quite excited. How was Joe, Kellik’s voice?”

“The exploration team leader’s voice was quite elevated.”

Well, it was natural for him to be excited.

The purity of the gold found at the epicenter was far superior to the gold vein discovered in Indonesia in 1983. If the exact deposits and distribution of the gold spread across the exploration area were known, it might make one faint.

Barbara’s eyes were more vibrant than ever.

Gold.

The chemical symbol is Au, derived from the Latin word for radiant dawn (Aurum).

A substance called the king of currency for thousands of years and whose value will not change even thousands of years later.

After President Nixon’s declaration of the gold demonetization policy, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom said it was difficult to see gold as an investment target anymore, but the world’s leading families and wealthy individuals were constantly craving gold.

It’s natural, isn’t it? The more unstable the monetary value of assets becomes, the more one has to rely on the immutable substance, gold.

“At the end of despair, you will greet a radiant dawn. Do you know what this means?”

“Chairman, I’m sorry, but I don’t understand.”

“It’s a phrase that miners who worked in the mines always engraved in their hearts. To them, the endless dark mine was the night to greet a radiant dawn.”

The reason Chairman Barbara craved gold was simple. Because it is the world’s reserve currency surpassing paper money? No, there was an even more important reason.

It was because of his parents who had worked in the mining industry all their lives. Hadn’t they been constantly seeking radiant dawns for their young child?

Barbara, who walked through endless darkness, was greeted by a ray of light.

“A mysterious boy.”

His eyes were as clear and transparent as a lake and as unfathomably deep as an ocean. He didn’t lose his composure while conversing with him. It was enough to give chills as beautiful as his performance.

For Chairman Barbara, the violinist Hyun was the radiant dawn he had been seeking.

Chairman Barbara stood up. To meet Hyun.

Kang Hyun faced the elderly professors looking at him. He wondered if this is what a fan meeting for celebrities would be like.

Would he have ever imagined standing before professors at Juilliard?

But the surprise didn’t end there.

‘A movie theater?’

Kang Hyun gasped when he realized the old man he met at the movie theater was the dean of Juilliard School. He hadn’t known New York was so small.

Josef was holding the music score Hyun had given him as if it were a sacred relic. The paper was already tattered as if several years had passed, showing how much he had studied it.

It seemed he had questions. The eyes of Dean Josef, who sat in the front row of the auditorium, were not just sharp but overflowing with vitality. As if he had been waiting for today.

“I’m not sure if I deserve such treatment, being in a position to meet the professors of Juilliard School. But honestly, it’s daunting to stand before professors with far deeper knowledge of music than myself.”

“Violinist Hyun, there’s no need to feel burdened. We invited you first to avoid a lack of time for questions if we included undergraduate students today. In fact, we all became your fans after watching your film.”

“Fans?”

Kang Hyun bowed deeply. It was a gesture of gratitude.

These were professors who had dedicated their lives to music. They were recognizing him.

What a meaningful occasion. As soon as Hyun showed courtesy, questions began pouring in, led by the head of the department, Oliver.

How many questions were there? They poured out like a floodgate had opened.

“The scene where you performed on a ship, was it really filmed on a ship?”

“Yes, it’s true.”

“It’s hard enough to perform on stable ground, but you did it on a ship. I thought it was special effects at first. The melody was very rich and unique. I heard you used a special playing technique. Is that true?”

The elderly professors asked fervent questions like students learning music for the first time. Hyun explained with all his might, and when words were insufficient, he didn’t hesitate to perform short pieces.

It seemed like the questions would never end, but Hyun didn’t mind.

Seeing the professors’ curious eyes made him feel like they had returned to their childhoods.

“Violinist Hyun, how did you shoot the scene where you performed in the Italian square? In the film, there was a scene where Paganini played a street song he had heard only once with his eyes closed. There’s a similar scene in ‘La Vie en Rose.’ Was that really performed on the spot?”

“No, I actually played the music I heard for the first time on the spot. The composer from Italy performed as a street musician.”

“It wasn’t staged?”

For most musicians, mimicking and playing by ear isn’t difficult.

But Paganini’s portrayal in the film far exceeded that realm.

He not only played the music he heard for the first time on the spot as if copying it but also adapted it into his own performance.

As the questions were wrapping up,

“Violinist Hyun, if it’s not too much trouble, could you interpret this score for me? The one you personally wrote for me at the movie theater.”

Josef eagerly raised his hand.

His eyes were filled with curiosity and excitement.

He had studied the score for days and nights but couldn’t play it as easily as the melody from that day.

It was to be expected. Even with Mozart’s compositions, hundreds of years old, interpretations varied.

In a way, this was a golden opportunity. The living composer was right in front of him.

“Well, instead of explaining, I’ll play it to interpret it for you.”

Josef clenched his fists in anticipation. The other professors were the same. They were excited to hear Hyun’s original composition.

Hyun, seeing the elderly professors, naturally took his position as if flowing with the water.

Looking at the garden filled with Juilliard School’s recordings, he recalled his college days.

While others were enjoying makgeolli or soju on the fresh grass, how fiercely had he lived? He had no memories like others might have.

It was understandable. As soon as he entered law school, he obsessively prepared for the bar exam.

“Oppa―!”

Son Yooha’s face was full of pride.

It was no wonder since she had witnessed him lecturing before professors with her own eyes.

She had looked at him so proudly that he almost cleared his throat several times.

“Oppa, you were really cool. You’d make a great professor someday.”

“Professor?”

“Yeah, Oppa as a professor and I’ll support you wholeheartedly―!”

Where did she learn to say such things? Her face was full of mischief.

At first, Yooha’s jokes were bewildering, but over time he got used to them. He had never seen such an adorable fox.

As he was about to pinch her cheeks playfully, the sound of a helicopter made him look up at the sky.

Come to think of it, America is really grand. Who would think of coming to a university by helicopter?

“Oh, I’ve been on that before.”

“What?”

“I rode that same helicopter in Korea. Grandpa took me on it.”

Ah, he had forgotten that Son Yooha was an heir to a conglomerate.

And the top conglomerate in Korea at that. No wonder about the helicopter. If they wanted, they could even charter a private jet.

As the helicopter noise faded, music began to flow from the green garden.

As expected of a performing arts school, students were playing instruments in the park.

“Oppa, your performance earlier was amazing.”

“You mean the last performance?”

“Yeah, it was your own composition. I can see why the professor in the front wanted to hear it so much. They all had such enchanted looks.”

It seemed like Yooha wanted to hear the performance again.

For Yooha, who had even brought him a lunchbox, he couldn’t refuse.

Moreover, the wind passing through the garden felt like an accompaniment caressing his ears.

The place seemed perfect, so why not give it a try?

“Giving a lecture to the professors at Juilliard.”

Barbara smiled pleasantly upon hearing the story from her secretary.

She was on her way to meet Kang Hyun to deliver news about the exploration area. Fortunately, it was Juilliard, a place she had some acquaintance with. She knew the chairman and had often donated scholarships.

But to think he gave a lecture to the professors at Juilliard.

‘The more I see, the more I want him.’

Kang Hyun, whom she initially thought of as a rough gemstone, became more attractive with time.

How he discovered the exploration area didn’t matter. Beyond the confidentiality clause in the contract, she was amazed by his initiative and courage in proposing the deal.

Barbara felt she had found a true friend after a long time.

“We have arrived, Chairman.”

The helicopter had reached Juilliard School. The chairman had already come out to greet Barbara, which was expected considering the annual donation she made.

“Chairman, if you don’t mind, could I look for Violinist Hyun without causing too much commotion?”

There was no need to move with a large entourage. Barbara asked for understanding and moved with just a bodyguard.

As they entered the building of the music school, the melodies were already resonating in their ears.

Despite being located in the heart of New York, the university had a green garden like an arboretum.

According to the report from the exploration team leader Kellik, the purity, estimated reserves, and distribution of the epicenter were enormous. She was curious how Violinist Hyun would react to this news.

Barbara had seen many wealthy individuals in her life. Some had become rich overnight, and others had made money in extraordinary ways.

But she felt Hyun would be different.

As always, he would accept the facts with a calm face. His deep and serene eyes came to mind.

Barbara quickened her pace without realizing it. The bodyguard had to follow her with caution.

Just then, she saw the green garden where Hyun was supposed to be. It was then.

“I’m a step late.”

Chairman Barbara smiled faintly and nodded.

In her amber eyes were a man and a woman. A scene that naturally brought a smile to her face.

Hyun was making music with a harmonica made of leaves while a girl looked at him lovingly.

“He has already grasped something more precious than gold.”

He was already spending his time in the radiant dawn.
