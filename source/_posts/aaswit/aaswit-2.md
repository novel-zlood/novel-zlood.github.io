Rowoon was focused on the white notebook.

He was checking the current state of his hand.

A nineteen-year-old hand without calluses.

What would it feel like to draw with an immature hand?

"Let's do it."

Even after injuring his hand, Rowoon had not given up on drawing for ten years.

Back then, it required immense patience.

The lines would often go astray.

It took ten to twenty times longer than others.

In the midst of that, he found a method.

He would momentarily apply firm pressure to his trembling hand.

Utilizing that brief moment to draw a line.

And combining those lines to complete a drawing.

"What should I draw?"

As Rowoon turned his head, he decided to draw the scenery of the orphanage visible outside the window.

Just as he was envisioning how to capture the scenery on paper,

Swish, swish.

He drew the lines exactly as he imagined.

As if he was tracing an outline.

Imagining the final result as much as possible, he moved his hand quickly.

It was astonishing to see the orphanage scenery take shape with the meeting of controlled lines.

The result of long practice.

Or perhaps a talent unique to Rowoon.

"It's nice that my hand feels light."

Rowoon smiled with genuine joy.

How delightful it was to move his hand as he wished.

It felt as if his hand was flying across the paper.

The method he had reluctantly learned in the past,

The ability to accurately draw what he envisioned in one go was sure to become Rowoon's strength in the future.

"But I will need a lot of practice to increase speed."

There was a constant break every time he drew a line.

That was also a habit from dealing with his spasming hand, but it was something time would resolve.

Just as the drawing was nearing completion,

Jihan, an elementary schooler who shared the same room, came running over.

Curious, he peeked over Rowoon's shoulder at the drawing.

"Wow!"

He exclaimed in admiration.

"Hyung, you're really good at drawing!"

Jihan's eyes sparkled as he looked at Rowoon.

**

After returning from school, Rowoon took out his report card from his bag.

In the past, he had no desire to go to college, but his school grades were not bad.

"This is doable."

He had a foundation to build on.

Furthermore, having drawn daily, he had somewhat warmed up his body...

"Shall I get moving?"

Rowoon knocked on the door of the orphanage director's office.

"What's the matter? Rowoon, you rarely come to my office."

Director Shim, dressed plainly, sat on the sofa with a cup of tea.

Rowoon was a particularly reserved child.

Mature for his age, he always followed well.

While other kids talked about all sorts of things, it was rare to hear about Rowoon's inner thoughts, so it was a welcome surprise.

But then, Rowoon unexpectedly brought up the topic of career counseling.

"I'm going to college."

"College?"

Director Shim's eyes widened.

The college admission rate for orphanage kids was very low.

They did not have the same conditions to focus on studying as kids receiving care at home, and it was especially hard for the kids to stay motivated.

Realistically, finding a job might be better than going to college, but giving up prematurely was heartbreaking.

So Director Shim wanted to hear more about Rowoon's thoughts.

"Which college?"

"Yuil Art University."

"Pfft."

But the unexpectedly high ambition made her spit out her tea.

"Oh my, I'm sorry."

"It's okay."

There wasn't anyone in Korea who didn't know Yuil Art University.

It was the school that immediately came to mind when one thought of "art" and was symbolic.

She knew Rowoon liked to draw since he was young, but...

"Sure, that's great. It's well-known for its art department..."

Director Shim trailed off as she wiped her mouth with a tissue.

Most elementary school kids' goal was 'Seoul National University.'

In other words, they all had big dreams.

As they moved up grades, they naturally realized the reality, and that was the story of high school students in this country.

‘If it were other kids, I would have told them to study harder first.’

But Rowoon was a senior.

He was good at studying, and he must have had his own calculations before mentioning Yuil Art University.

With a complicated mind, Director Shim started asking seriously.

"Which department do you want to go to?"

"I want to major in design."

Rowoon wanted to do design, which could be directly seen and felt in daily life, rather than fine arts, which was like a pie in the sky for now.

He also had more of a longing for that field.

"I see, design..."

On the other hand, the more Director Shim listened to Rowoon, the heavier her heart felt.

Because it seemed like an impossible story.

‘But regardless of whether it's possible or not...’

If Rowoon had decided to go to college, he must have already prepared himself for the financial issues.

College tuition fees, living costs in Seoul, etc.

There were limits to the support the orphanage could provide.

But what was immediately needed was.

"But Rowoon, won't you need to attend an art academy to prepare for that college?"

"Yes, that's right."

Most importantly, to go to an art school, one had to attend an academy.

No matter how talented one was and how well one could draw, there was a certain framework suited for the entrance exam.

And the fees for arts academies...

It was at a level difficult for the orphanage to handle.

Rowoon knew that too.

But.

‘That doesn't mean I can give up.’

So Rowoon asked politely.

"That's why, Director, is there any way to get sponsorship?"

It was a difficult matter that required connections with someone who wasn't a parent.

Director Shim spoke with a worried expression.

"You know, getting sponsorship isn't something we can do at will."

It wasn't something that could be achieved just by being earnest, nor would it fall from the sky suddenly.

So Director Shim thought hard and then mentioned the only thing that came to mind.

"There will be an event soon where nearby orphanages gather. How about participating in the drawing contest there first?"

"A drawing contest?"

"Yes, it's a big event hosted by the city, so you might meet someone who can give you advice, and they give out professional materials like paints and pastels as prizes."

Director Shim thought Rowoon's goal was almost impossible.

But as a guardian, it wasn't right to draw a line and say it's not possible from the start.

So she thought it would be better to objectively judge Rowoon's drawing skills.

‘And we might get realistic advice from the officials participating in the event.’

On the other hand, if there was even a tiny chance,

Rowoon, who had firmly decided to do whatever it took, nodded.

"Yes, I want to participate in that contest."

**

"Oh, teacher, why are you taking us?"

Someone grumbled on the way while riding a van labeled 'Hope Orphanage.'

They were kids selected by Director Shim, known for their drawing skills in the orphanage.

"I know you guys will just laze around indoors, so it's better to get some fresh air and draw."

"Ah, this is because of Rowoon, right? Kids like us can't draw for real."

"Hey, I told you not to talk like that. You have to live thinking you can do anything."

Director Shim nagged again while turning the steering wheel.

In the past, it sounded like mere nagging, but now it was clear she was genuinely thinking of the kids.

Hoping they wouldn't undermine their potential themselves.

But the kids, already dulled by the harsh realities, were busy grumbling without much motivation.

Having experienced such a setback once, Rowoon felt sorry for the orphanage kids who were used to giving up.

‘They need someone to show them rather than tell them. That anything is possible.’

If there had been such a person,

Rowoon might have held onto hope back then.

So he wanted to achieve his dream even more.

To prove with his life that it was possible. 

Hoping that kids in the same situation as him wouldn't live with regrets.

At that moment, Jihan, who was sitting in the front seat, suddenly turned and spoke.

"But I've seen it, Rowoon hyung is really good at drawing."

"Hey, kid, why did you come along?"

"I wanted to go out and play too."

"Do you think this is a trip to play?"

When one of the older kids scolded him, Jihan quickly hid his body in the front seat.

Rowoon wasn't unaware that Jihan, who recently had been looking at him with sparkling eyes, had followed him here.

Screeech.

The old van parked noisily.

Large banners were hung here and there in the large park.

Seeing the temporary booths and the bustling people, it seemed the event was bigger than expected.

There were kids from other orphanages too.

There were also people participating for cooperation.

Especially seeing the booth of the 'Shinhwa Scholarship Foundation,' it seemed to be an event supported by the Shinhwa Group.

"Kids, let's go over there."

Easels were lined up on one side of the park, and the contest was scheduled to be held there.

Director Shim was busy greeting familiar faces here and there, and during that time, someone introduced to him made his face light up.

"Are you Director Bae from the 'Creative Afternoon' art academy in the city?"

"Haha, yes. I was asked by the city to judge, so I participated."

"Oh my, it's the biggest art academy in our neighborhood. Director Bae, we have a kid among our students who wants to go to art school. Is it possible to have a consultation after the contest?"

"Consultation?"

The art academy director’s face showed a hint of discomfort.

But he reluctantly nodded.

"Well, a consultation is possible."

He knew better than anyone how unrealistic it was for an orphan to pursue art.

Although he came to judge, as the director of an art academy, he knew best.

Just the academy fees for college preparation were over 40 a month.

And compared to the special lectures held every vacation, that was nothing.

‘It would be best to dissuade him appropriately to save everyone's time.’

Even if he could make some money from the academy fees, that pricked the conscience of the art academy director.

So he intended to block the start to prevent wasting each other's time.

At that moment, the voice of the event host echoed from afar.

"We will start the contest soon."

Rowoon and the other high school kids sat in their assigned seats, while elementary schooler Jihan held the director's hand tightly, watching them from a distance.

"Today's theme is 'Our Free Park.' Please feel free to use any materials you brought."

A hopeful and easy theme, perfect to exhibit drawings by orphanage kids.

As soon as the theme was announced, the kids around took out their materials.

The kids from 'Hope Orphanage' reluctantly took out the materials that the director had prepared, but Rowoon only placed a single pencil on the easel.

Seeing that, a kid from the same orphanage asked curiously.

"Rowoon, what are you doing? Why aren't you taking out other materials?"

"I'm only going to use a pencil."

"What about an eraser?"

"I don't need that either."

"Are you giving up on the contest already? Then why did you bring us here?"

That kid clicked his tongue.

But Rowoon had no intention of giving up at all.

A little later.

The sound of pencils scratching started to be heard from all around.

Most were filling their papers with visible trees and lakes.

But Rowoon was carefully looking around for the scene he wanted to capture on paper.

Until he caught a scene that felt just right.

Seeing Rowoon still not drawing anything, Director Shim let out a puzzled sigh.

"Why isn't Rowoon drawing anything?"

Though he had dreams.

When he tried to draw at such a contest, he might have been hit by what's called reality check.

Was it a vain dream? Can I really do it? Thoughts like that.

So she thought he might feel his limits and give up on his own.

The elementary schooler Jihan, who knew Rowoon's drawing skills, said with a cheerful face.

"Don't worry, director. Rowoon hyung draws really, really well."

"Really? What did you see that makes you say that?"

Worried, the director smiled affectionately at the sparkling-eyed Jihan.

But suddenly.

"Look, look!"

Jihan pointed somewhere with his small finger.

And where his finger pointed,

Rowoon was drawing smooth lines with an extraordinary movement.

Swish, swish.

His hand movements were mesmerizing, like conducting an orchestra.

And the bold strokes without hesitation.

Surprised by the unique drawing style, not only Director Shim but also,

‘···Who is this kid?’

The attention of the officials gradually focused on Rowoon.
