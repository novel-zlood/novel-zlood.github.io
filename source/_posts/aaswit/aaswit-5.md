The study of Vice President Han Taeho of Shinhwa Group.

A mountain of documents to be approved was piled up in front of his desk.

“Another day gone just signing papers.”

In front of him, diligently moving his fountain pen.

His daughter, Han Daye, was sitting.

“So, what do you need to tell me? I have my art lessons soon.”

Han Daye checked the digital clock on the desk indifferently.

Her father wouldn’t have called her just to encourage or cheer her up.

“Did you do well on the college entrance exam?”

“You’ll know when the report card comes out.”

As expected, he called to check the results.

To see if Han Daye was moving according to his plan.

There was no warm word like ‘You did well’ or ‘Good job.’

Han Daye hated this feeling of being powerless in front of her father’s rigid plans.

“Raised you with indulgence, and now you’re getting rebellious.”

“It’s not because of indulgence. I have my own will.”

“Agreeing to let you major in Design instead of Aesthetics was a huge concession for me.”

“That was settled years ago.”

From her perspective, it was a strategy to make slight deviations easier.

Entering a practice-oriented department to receive less control.

Moreover, it was the first time she went against her father's wishes.

In that, Han Daye felt a strange sense of accomplishment.

She knew she would have to live according to her father’s plans after graduation.

At that moment, Vice President Han Taeho counseled her in a low voice.

“Have you still not realized? Even after seeing those kids who can’t do what they want?”

“···.”

“Doing your best in your given position. That’s how you don’t mock those who can’t.”

Han Daye remembered Rowoon’s painting she saw at the event that day.

A talent too precious to be buried.

So, she couldn’t refute her father’s words to be grateful for her blessings.

A secretary knocked and entered the study.

“I contacted the Hope Orphanage.”

Han Daye perked up at the word orphanage.

“You mean the kid who won the gold prize? Indeed, the painting stood out.”

“I thought it was too good to be buried.”

“Right. Did you make sure the sponsor remains anonymous?”

“Yes. They seemed too busy to answer my questions.”

Han Daye instantly realized that the sponsorship was for Rowoon.

Vice President Han Taeho nodded without stopping his signing.

The reason he sponsored Rowoon separately, without going through Shinhwa Group’s foundation, was because he didn’t want to go through the complicated procedures again.

Noblesse Oblige.

Though a cold businessman, he didn’t neglect his social duties.

Maybe not as a father, but to others, he seemed like an ideal manager.

Then, Han Taeho’s face turned stern as he spoke.

“Did you also tell them that there will be no sponsorship without results?”

“Yes, I conveyed that.”

Of course, he never helped anyone just out of pity.

As a businessman, performance-based principles were inevitable.

Wasting money and time was something Han Taeho hated the most.

‘Of course.’

Han Daye smirked at her father’s consistent performance-based principles.

And she felt relieved that Rowoon wouldn’t have to waste his talent and could continue with art.

At the same time, she felt a slight thrill from her father contradicting his own lesson that day.

‘It’s not that you can’t do it if you have nothing; it’s that a way appears if you have talent.’

She wondered if Rowoon could meet her father’s standards and receive the sponsorship, and what future he would create if he did.

The atmosphere at the art academy the day after the college entrance exam was like a funeral.

The gap between dreams and reality.

It was a day to taste that frustration bitterly.

“Hey, man. How could you think of Geonguk University, Geonguk University! You can barely apply to the Chungju campus.”

“Teacher, please. I can ace the practicals.”

“30% from student records, 40% from the college entrance exam, 30% from practicals. You’ve already messed up 70%, what can you do? Bring your parents tomorrow.”

“Sniff…”

One by one, they were called out during class and returned hitting a wall of despair.

Each school had slightly different practical types, so they had to be grouped by the schools they were applying to.

No matter how good you were at drawing, schools were divided based on grades.

It was a harsh reality for those preparing for art schools.

“Damn, I’m screwed. Can’t apply to any universities in Seoul.”

“I have to apply to a university I’ve never even heard of…”

“Sniff, I should’ve studied harder.”

The students returning to the practice room dabbed at their tears with their sleeves.

Most had to apply to universities far below their original targets.

Few students performed better on the actual exam than on the mock exams.

“Hey, if you’re good at both studies and practicals, you’re a god, not a human!”

Soon, the academy’s veteran, Park Changhoon, stormed in.

He probably had to lower his target schools significantly, hurting his pride.

“Lee Rowoon, the director wants to see you last.”

He pointed to Rowoon as the next consultation target, offering early words of consolation.

“Men should dream big. Even if you can’t achieve it, don’t be too disappointed. Your ambition for Yuil Art University was admirable.”

He gave a thumbs-up to Rowoon, as if foreseeing an impending tragedy.

It was a corny line, like something out of a boy’s comic.

But Rowoon’s preliminary scores made Director Bae smile instead.

It was the brightest expression Bae had ever shown.

“Wow, Rowoon, your scores went up even more?”

Until the last mock exam, he barely had the grades to challenge Yuil Art University.

So, even if he had to apply to two lower-ranked schools, he was thinking of trying for Yuil Art University.

“This might actually…”

Director Bae, who looked like a chubby David, gulped.

Students challenging Yuil Art University didn’t come around often.

Especially in these provincial branches.

So, Rowoon was like a unicorn.

Top-notch in both practicals and grades.

“Then there’s no need to lower the other schools. Great! Let’s aim for the top 3 art schools in Korea!”

“Yes, as long as I can apply to Yuil Art University, I don’t care.”

“Investing in you was a masterstroke.”

Director Bae looked at Rowoon with a beaming face, as if he were a golden nugget.

Rowoon cautiously spoke up.

“But, sir, about what I mentioned before…”

“Yes, they are supposed to come today. They should be arriving soon.”

Director Bae craned his neck to look toward the lobby.

**

The head teacher clapped as he entered the now somber practice room.

“We’ll be dividing classes by school now, so move according to your consultation results!”

Since each school had different practical types.

To facilitate smooth lessons, they were rearranging seats by school.

Thud. Thud.

The classroom was filled with the dull noise of students packing their scattered materials into their art supply boxes.

At that moment, a large, unfamiliar young man was seen entering the classroom.

The young man, guided by the director, entered a side room attached to the classroom.

Someone watching the scene closely shouted quietly.

“Did you see that? A golem appeared in the academy!”

“Where, where?”

The boy’s joke immediately piqued the children’s interest, and they crowded around the side room’s glass door.

Though the frosted glass didn’t offer a clear view, it was evident that a large person was inside.

“Who is that?”

“Could it be a repeat student who bombed the exam?”

Since it wasn’t uncommon for students who failed the college entrance exam to turn to art, that’s what everyone was thinking.

“What are you kids doing here?”

The head teacher squeezed through the kids.

“Shouldn’t you be packing instead of wasting time?”

After scolding the kids, he stuck a paper on the glass door.

Thud. Thud.

The words in bold script on the paper.

-Yuil Art University Preparation Class.

It was enough to shock the kids.

“Who’s applying to Yuil Art University from our academy?”

The academy was instantly abuzz.

Even kids who were packing up focused on the side room, and more students crowded around it.

“What’s going on?”

“Who’s applying to Yuil Art University?”

Amid the growing commotion, Park Changhoon remembered Rowoon’s earlier goal of Yuil Art University.

“Could it be…”

Just then.

“Excuse me, coming through.”

Rowoon’s voice came from somewhere.

As if thinking the same, the kids parted on both sides like the Red Sea.

“…”

A quiet stillness fell among the kids, and Park Changhoon was speechless.

Rowoon walked up to him.

“Changhoon.”

“Huh, yeah?”

“Could you open the door?”

“Oh, right. The door.”

Flustered, Park Changhoon stepped aside, allowing Rowoon to enter the side room.

Once Rowoon disappeared behind the glass door, the kids’ chatter resumed as if someone had hit play.

“Is this for real?”

“Is Lee Rowoon really preparing for Yuil Art University?”

“Wow… He must have done well on the exam. So cool…”

“Suddenly, he looks even more handsome.”

Amid the murmurs of envy and admiration.

Inside the side room.

“Oh! You’re here, Rowoon.”

The Yuil Art University student he met at the event.

Tak Museok was waiting for Rowoon.

Rowoon, who didn’t have a cellphone, had been getting advice via email, and now they were meeting as teacher and student at the academy.

“Thank you for coming.”

“I should be thanking you. You found me a job here.”

“I felt bad asking for free advice all the time.”

If practicing by university type was important.

Having a teacher who could teach it ‘accurately’ was even more crucial.

So, he tipped off the director that a Yuil Art University student was in town.

He never thought a brief encounter in the past would help this much.

Meanwhile, Tak Museok, eager to make Rowoon his junior, shouted resolutely.

“Alright, let’s conquer Yuil Art University!”

**

For two months, he did nothing but draw, except for eating and sleeping.

He was confined in the side room all day, practicing all types with Tak Museok.

Gradually, the students began taking their exams.

Finally, the day came.

The day Rowoon took the practical exam for Yuil Art University.

“Rowoon, did you pack your tools well?”

“Yes.”

“Then let’s go.”

The art academy’s director, Bae, opened the door of his small red car with cold hands.

It wasn’t unusual for provincial students to be taken by the academy, but it was the first time the director himself was driving.

Thud.

Tak Museok, with his large frame, squeezed into the back seat.

“…”

A silence filled the car.

Only the soft music the director played to ease the tension filled the small car.

Squeak. Squeak.

The sound of the wipers moving busily was heard.

It was lightly snowing today.

“We’re almost there.”

After a long drive, they arrived at.

-Yuil Art University.

The words engraved on the main gate caught Rowoon’s eyes.

The past, where he was deeply despised for being uneducated.

The days of resentment flashed by like a revolving lantern.

Rowoon steeled himself once more.

‘I will engrave those words into my life.’

Using Korea’s top art university as a stepping stone.

He vowed to see a new future.

Because giving up was not an option in this life.
