The classroom was enveloped in silence.

The desire to make a good impression on the professor on the first day had now turned into a hope to avoid getting noticed.

'Please, let this barrage of questions end soon.'

That was the only thought in the students' minds as they looked at Rowoon.

No matter how prestigious the art university they got into, they were still freshmen.

They were rookies who had only focused on high school entrance exams.

Even if they were good at entrance exam drawings or high school education, they were almost blank slates when it came to practical design.

They might have been level 99 in high school, but here, where everyone was at a similar level, they had to start from level 1 again.

However, Rowoon had spent several days holed up in the art information center reading various books.

The more he read, the more his curiosity grew, and his desire to explore deepened.

Just like a glass being filled with clear water, Rowoon's mind was brimming with basic knowledge about design.

While he was still far from perfect, he had taken a few steps from the starting line.

"Why do you think a designer needs to learn tools?" Professor Eun Sungyeon asked with anticipation.

Basing his answer on his studies, Rowoon shared his thoughts.

"The origin of the word 'design' comes from the Latin 'designare' and the Italian 'disegno.' It fundamentally means 'to plan.' A designer is someone who plans according to functionality or aesthetics, and I think learning tools is necessary to effectively convey that plan."

It was an answer that went back to the essence of being a designer, which Eun Sungyeon found very satisfying.

With a pleased smile, Professor Eun asked the next question.

"To effectively convey, you need to learn tools. That's good. Then, do you think someone who can't handle tools isn't a designer?"

It was the same question he had asked another student earlier.

Since that student couldn't answer further, the classmates focused even more on Rowoon.

Rowoon recalled his time working at a printing shop before his regression.

Back then, even though his hands were clumsy, he could use the tools at a professional level.

But that didn't make him a designer.

He was just playing a functional role to facilitate smooth printing.

Yet, even if a designer couldn't handle tools well and sent in a sloppy file, they were still called a designer.

So...

"As I mentioned, the essence of a designer lies in 'planning.' Therefore, even if one doesn't use digital tools, as long as they can effectively convey their plan, they can be considered a designer. However."

"Go on."

"Being able to use tools without planning would make one more of a technician than a designer. Just as being able to use a hammer or drill doesn't make one an architect."

It was a very insightful answer.

It wasn’t just repeating what he had read in books; it was as if he had experienced it firsthand, providing an accurate explanation.

This showed he had a good understanding of the concept.

Professor Eun Sungyeon was very pleased.

'Yes, we need at least one student like this to represent Yuil Art University.'

Students generally fell into two categories: those strong in theory and those strong in practice.

This could be quickly identified after teaching for just one semester.

But there were always students who stood out from the first day.

Among the class of 2011, Rowoon seemed to be particularly strong in theory.

'I hope this student will excel in practice as well.'

Although it was just a feeling, it was something that only time and further classes would reveal.

Sometimes, there were students who spoke very well but were terrible with tools.

Professor Eun looked around at the students.

Their eyes were already stimulated by the standout student.

"Many of you already know how to use Photoshop and Illustrator. Can we call you designers because of that?

No. As the student just mentioned, what's important for a designer is planning, and tools are just a means to effectively express that.

I hope you all first adopt the mindset of a designer and then become proactive explorers in learning the tools."

It seemed like it was time to start the class in earnest.

But before that.

"Student, what was your name again?"

"I'm Lee Rowoon."

He mentally noted the student's name.

"An impressive name. Let's begin our first class."

**

"You’ve just gained the attention of Professor Eun Sungyeon for the first time."

Song Jaebum, standing in front of the vending machine, made a 'ding' sound effect with his mouth.

Clunk, thud.

He then took out a drink and handed it to Rowoon.

"Song Jaebum supports Lee Rowoon, the savior, with 800 coins."

"What are you doing?"

"Don’t you read fantasy novels?"

Rowoon chuckled as he accepted the drink.

"Thanks, I'll enjoy it."

"Man, if it weren't for you, the class atmosphere would've been a mess. I was too busy avoiding the professor’s eyes, afraid he'd ask me a question."

Song Jaebum sighed as he gulped down his cola.

"Full-on class from the first day. It looks like a tough road ahead."

"Well, we did come here to study."

"...True. By the way, how do you already know so much? Did you transfer from another school...?"

Jaebum, who had assumed they were the same age, suddenly looked startled and hesitated, realizing he hadn’t asked about Rowoon’s age.

"I'm the same age as you."

"Right? Oh, you scared me."

Jaebum laughed brightly and patted his chest in relief.

"Well, you are the top student among us. I guess it makes sense you could answer like that."

The two of them strolled around campus with their drink cans in hand.

The fresh green buds filled the campus with the warmth of spring.

But today, there were a series of temporary booths lined up along the path.

Rowoon showed interest in them.

"What’s that about?"

"They're promoting clubs, trying to recruit new members. Shall we take a look?"

As they were browsing the booths, a female student suddenly stood in front of them.

"Are you freshmen? Interested in theater?"

"No, I'm okay..."

The girl ignored Jaebum, who was waving his hand dismissively, and pointed at Rowoon.

"You there."

"I'm not interested, thank you."

Rowoon politely declined, and the girl handed him a pamphlet with some regret.

Looking ahead, he saw Han Daye being approached at another club booth.

"If you practice English conversation beforehand, it will help you when you’re looking for a job later..."

"Sorry, I was born in the U.S. Oh, there's my friend."

Upon spotting Rowoon, Han Daye quickly joined him.

Jaebum greeted her cheerfully as she approached.

"Are you thinking of joining a club?"

"I barely have enough time for assignments and fun."

"Right, having fun is important."

After a moment of silence, Han Daye turned slightly to Rowoon.

"Lee Rowoon, are you interested in any clubs?"

"Not sure."

In his previous life, he had been so focused on work that he had no memorable everyday experiences.

So this time, he wanted to try everything he could while enjoying campus life.

At that moment, Jaebum leaned in closer and lowered his voice.

"By the way, do you know about the famous joint club between Seohan University and our school?"

Seohan University, which was near Yuil University, was one of the most prestigious universities in Korea.

It was attended by very bright students.

"Only selected people can join that club, and the connections you make there are incredible."

"What kind of club is it?"

Han Daye showed interest, and Jaebum took a moment before answering.

"It's an art volunteer club called 'Charming.'"

"A volunteer club named 'Charming'?"

"The name's a bit odd, but it's great for gaining various experiences related to art and for networking. I heard there's even a famous person in that club. So a lot of people line up to join."

Jaebum spoke with a face full of enthusiasm, as if he were interested in the club himself.

But Han Daye, sensing something, hit the nail on the head.

"Seems like you’re more interested in something other than volunteering?"

"Hey, what do you take me for? It’s about doing good while gaining some benefits along the way."

"Hmm, I think I understand why they are picky about who they select."

She nodded playfully, looking at Jaebum.

'An art volunteer club, huh.'

Rowoon thought it didn’t sound bad.

He didn’t know how art and volunteering were connected, but if he could use his art skills...

"I heard there's a senior from our department in 'Charming.'"

For a moment, he remembered the face of Tak Moosuk, who wore a fluorescent vest and did face painting.

That senior had met Rowoon while volunteering.

'No way.'

But the club didn’t seem that impressive when he saw it at the event.

They were now at the end of the booths.

Jaebum turned to the two and asked.

"Shall we go eat at the cafeteria?"

"I have an appointment, so I’ll go first."

Han Daye waved briefly and left,

"I'm not hungry, so I'll go back and work on my assignments. Enjoy your meal."

Rowoon patted Jaebum on the shoulder and headed back to the art building.

Left alone in an instant, Jaebum muttered in a sad voice.

"See, I knew no one would want to eat with me."

**

Whether it was due to poor home computer specs or a lack of a personal laptop,

Most of the students engrossed in the computer lab were freshmen.

'Everyone's working hard.'

Since Rowoon didn’t have a computer at home, he was also working on his assignments based on what he had learned that day in an empty spot.

The assignment for the week was to cut and paste various photos to create a composite image.

Having worked in a print shop in the past, Rowoon was skilled with digital tools.

Back then, even a slight tremor in his hand would cause the cursor to move off-screen, so he used to use the mouse with his left hand.

'It’s inconvenient to change settings every time since it's not my computer.'

He decided to adapt to using the mouse with his right hand.

Still, he was well-versed in the functions and effects of each tool.

Soon, the blue rectangular window of Photoshop appeared.

Since it was for web use, he set it to RGB.

He duplicated the background layer and used the pen tool to cut out the necessary parts.

Click. Click. Click.

Cutting out the photo was quick since he had a good feel for it.

There were no obstacles in the process, from adjusting the color balance for a natural composite to creating the final image.

A classmate who had been struggling beside him watched in awe and admired his work.

"Rowoon, you’re really good with tools. Did you learn this before coming to school?"

"Yeah."

Even though he had regressed, it wasn’t wrong to say he had learned it before coming to this school.

"Do you know why my image is only coming out in black and white?"

"I think you set it to grayscale initially. In that case..."

A moment later, the classmate’s face lit up as their problem was resolved.

"Wow, just like that. I’ve been struggling with this for 20 minutes. Thank you so much."

But then, the classmate suddenly flinched.

Following his gaze, Rowoon saw Tak Moosuk standing there.

"Rowoon, it’s great to see you helping your classmates."

"Huh? Haha."

"Do you have a moment?"

Tak Moosuk called Rowoon aside.

He looked around and then went into an empty lecture room.

"Senior, what is this about..."

Swoosh.

He handed Rowoon a piece of paper.

"As the vice president, I'm extending this offer to you."

"Pardon?"

"The art volunteer club, 'Charming.' Are you interested in joining?"

It was the very club Jaebum had mentioned earlier.
