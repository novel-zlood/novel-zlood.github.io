"The best design I think is..."

"Is that really the best you can do?"

Professor Ji Hwasan's dissatisfied voice echoed through the room.

Students whose grades and drawings are in the top 1% of the country.

But despite the good material, they were still fledglings who hadn't even taken their first steps as designers.

Professor Ji Hwasan was using this presentation to grasp their basic abilities and inclinations.

What direction they pursued as designers, how well they visually structured their presentations, and how effectively they communicated their ideas.

'There's no better way to assess basic competencies than this.'

By pointing out the most problematic parts, he was suggesting which areas they needed to improve.

Of course, Professor Ji was using his own shock therapy style.

"Where on earth did you find such a horrible font?"

"Your voice is too soft. It's making me sleepy."

"So, what exactly are you trying to say?"

While Professor Eunsung Yeon calmly pointed out facts, Professor Ji Hwasan was more of a hot-tempered fact brute.

Because of his consistent harsh critiques, the faces of the students who hadn't presented yet turned pale.

Even the usually relaxed Song Jaebeom was nervously shaking his leg.

Looking around uneasily, he whispered to Rowoon.

"Look, everyoneâ€™s getting torn apart."

"Indeed."

"I told you, it's just a matter of the degree of tearing apart."

As Song Jaebeom's tension rose, Rowoon simply responded with a smile.

Their peers had brought various products.

Products showcasing witty imagination.

Sleek furniture by a designer pursuing modernism.

And even a sports car with a standout smooth shape.

Among them, the most prepared product by far was from the American tech company, Able.

"I chose the Able Phone by Able as the best design, and the reason is..."

At a time when the Able Phone was making a major launch in Korea, consumer demand for it was exploding.

The Able Phone's design, eliminating the button keypad and covering the front with glass, along with its OS, was nothing short of revolutionary at the time.

When three presentations on the Able Phone had passed.

Song Jaebeom's face was almost gray.

It was obvious what he had prepared without even seeing it.

Finally, it was Song Jaebeom's turn.

As soon as he pulled up his PPT with a tense expression.

"Another Able Phone? Did you all plan this together?"

Professor Ji Hwasan's first words pierced Song Jaebeom's heart.

Han Daye had prepared a presentation on the Moonlight Lamp by Danish designer Verner Panton.

"You can unfold the circular frames layered around the central axis as much as you want. The soft light shining through the frames is a romantic light, like moonlight. I chose this product because of its charm of allowing the user to adjust its shape as needed."

She showed no signs of nervousness.

Seeing her articulate well what she wanted to say, Professor Ji Hwasan thought Han Daye seemed like a smart and gutsy kid.

"The design is attractive because it allows user engagement in its shape. Is that it?"

"Yes, I liked that it broke the stereotype that lighting must be used as installed."

"Okay, good job."

Han Daye's presentation wasn't bad.

But it felt like a textbook example of a model student.

There wasn't much to criticize, but it wasn't surprising either.

However, students envied her just for not getting criticized.

Professor Ji Hwasan, sitting in the front, stretched his back once.

"Oh boy, how many presentations are left?"

The design major class was a two-hour session.

It was time for the tension of the presenting students to ease.

And also enough time for the professor to feel fatigued.

At that moment, someone spoke.

"There's only one last presenter left."

"Last one?"

Professor Ji instinctively turned around from his seat.

And the one coming forward was none other than Rowoon.

Professor Ji Hwasan's lips naturally curved up.

He remembered the audacity Rowoon showed with his drawing during the entrance exam.

'Let's see what you brought.'

With half-doubt, he closely watched the screen.

**

[?]

A large question mark on the first page.

That was the first PPT slide Rowoon had prepared.

'What is this?'

As expected, the peers showed curiosity.

Attracting the audience's attention first is crucial for effectively conveying ideas.

When Rowoon worked at a sculpture company.

He realized that designers' presentations didn't receive good evaluations because they lacked engagement.

"Last time, I mentioned that I wanted to create practical and rational art. My starting point for this assignment was, 'What is the best design?'"

Rowoon's gestures exuded confidence rather than nervousness.

His life experiences were different from the twenty-year-olds there.

'Drawing attention before showing the conclusion? That's not a skill a freshman would usually use.'

Professor Ji Hwasan's fatigue-filled eyes began to sparkle.

It was an effective way to pique his curiosity.

"If you think about it, all the products around us have the optimal form suited for their purposes. They are 'designed' that way.

Then, if you ask what among them feels like the best design, my answer would be..."

Rowoon paused and moved to the next slide.

Then, sounds of 'Huh?' filled the room.

Rowoon waited until all the curiosity gathered.

"I would say it's the spoon."

He said in a strong voice.

A picture of an ordinary spoon appeared on the screen.

The spoon we see every day at the dining table.

'That's the best design?'

'Something's wrong here.'

The atmosphere in the lecture room became slightly odd.

It wasn't a famous designer's product or something grand that everyone might aspire to.

It was just an everyday object.

Not something that felt cool or extraordinary.

'Isn't he the top student?'

'Then why did he bring that...'

Rowoon deliberately let them be confused.

The more their attention focused on him, the more interesting the reaction would be.

As Rowoon intended, his peers' eyes became clearer.

They whispered among themselves, wondering why a spoon was on the screen in this class.

Then, their gaze naturally shifted to Professor Ji Hwasan.

'What will the professor say?'

But Professor Ji Hwasan maintained an inscrutable expression.

"Go on."

Rowoon nodded slightly and continued his presentation.

"The diversity of products you brought today shows that everyone has different aspirations for what they consider the best.

What I aim for is a design that as many people as possible can use. So the spoon caught my eye."

Then, some murmurs of understanding were heard.

"In fact, we can't say that the spoon is a product designed by a specific person. It is presumed to have started in prehistoric times when people began using shellfish to scoop food.

It has evolved into the most practical and efficient form through different eras and cultures."

Some nodded at the new knowledge, while others admired Rowoon's unique perspective.

"Ease of use even for children, practicality that has survived through history, and efficiency developed over time.

I want to create a design that is easy to use, long-lasting, and useful to many people."

Rowoon's presentation concluded.

Even after it ended, the lecture room was filled with lingering emotions.

Before the shock of bringing a spoon for the assignment faded, his straightforward conclusion resonated deeply.

Not something flashy and excellent.

But what he considered the best design.

Some peers, who had prepared seemingly plausible answers, felt a sense of shame.

'His conviction is pretty cool.'

'He already feels like a designer.'

'I need to rethink what design I truly want...'

It was evident that his peers, stimulated by Rowoon's presentation, were having different thoughts.

Meanwhile, Han Daye's heart was racing.

It wasn't a romantic thrill but a feeling of being flustered.

'What is this...'

For Han Daye, who had lived her life precisely by the book.

It was an unprecedented and unconventional method.

Like Rowoon's drawing, which seemed randomly painted but was beautifully completed.

He kept producing quite plausible results in unusual ways.

She had approached the assignment thinking about grades.

But after seeing Rowoon's presentation, design seemed more interesting than she had thought.

It was truly fascinating.

'Everything around us is design.'

She pondered over Rowoon's presentation, looking around with a changed perspective.

At that moment, Professor Ji Hwasan stood up.

"The term 'useful design,' I like it."

His own thoughts, conclusions, and communication skills.

It was a presentation worthy of high praise.

Honestly, he had never seen a first presentation that he liked this much.

Walking forward slowly, he spoke.

"Usefulness means creating a product with value worth using. It aligns with what I said you need to consider when designing."

Throughout his speech, the students exchanged surprised looks.

He wasn't criticizing someone; he was praising.

A stark contrast to the stories they'd heard from seniors.

"I'm looking forward to how useful your designs will be. From next week until the finals, let's develop the sculptures based on the reasons you presented."

As he was about to wrap up the class.

A male student raised his hand.

"What is it?"

"After seeing Rowoon's presentation, I realized I was off track. I'd like to re-examine the product from my design perspective. Could you give us another chance?"

If there's one outstanding student.

The overall level rises.

Hiding his satisfaction, Ji Hwasan announced.

"For fairness, the evaluation scores will be based on today's presentations. But those who want to correct their direction can prepare for next week."

**

Back in his office, Ji Hwasan chuckled.

"In all my life, it's the first time someone brought a spoon for that topic. It's just mind-blowing."

The fact that Rowoon used something as common as a spoon to draw his own conclusion was immensely satisfying.

Getting fascinated by something special was like an occupational hazard for Professor Ji.

'He definitely has his own unique creativity. I'm really looking forward to his future.'

The graduate students knew that Professor Ji's reaction was a sign he liked someone.

His face, usually tired from a project, was now blooming with a rare smile.

They were all working on a project together recently.

Barely going home, wearing the same clothes for days.

Seeing the faces in the office more than their families.

But fortunately, the end was in sight.

One of the graduate students asked him.

"Professor, what happened?"

"A freshman who actually understands the 'D' in design just joined."

Ji Hwasan laughed as if it was unbelievable.

At that moment, a great idea struck him.

"Hey, how about we include a freshman in this project?"

Even though the project was nearing completion, it still felt 1% lacking.

He thought that freshman might bring a fresh perspective.

"Who? You mean a graduate student?"

Someone asked naturally.

But.

"No, a first-year undergraduate."

"What?"

The graduate students widened their eyes in surprise.
