“What’s your dream?”  

My dream?  

When I was young, my dream was to become an artist.  

Because I was good at drawing.  

Because drawing was fun.  

But it didn’t take long to face reality.  

‘That kid, Go Ara, can’t even get into college, so what’s the use of being good at art?’  

As soon as I turned twenty, I left the orphanage.  

Right after that, I had to support myself.  

Rowoon immediately started doing manual labor.  

For five years, he worked at all sorts of sites, enduring the cold if it was cold, and the heat if it was hot.  

“You have a talent with your hands. Why don’t you come work for our company?”  

After that, he was lucky to get a job after catching the eye of the president of a sculpting company.  

-Viiiiiinng.  

“Cough, cough, cough. Ah, Lee Rowoon, are you okay?”  

Song Jaebum came in, waving his hand through the dusty air.  

He was the only colleague who treated Lee Rowoon without any formality, despite Rowoon not having gone to college.  

Rowoon slightly lifted his old and yellowed dust mask.  

“Why are you here? There’s sawdust everywhere.”  

Here too, he was still doing work close to manual labor.  

Song Jaebum sighed as he looked at Rowoon, covered in white dust.  

“I can’t tell if you’re sawdust or if the sawdust is you.”  

“Stop with the pointless jokes.”  

“Honestly, what would our company do without you?”  

Still, the company had grown significantly since Rowoon started working there.  

Thanks to his reputation for finishing whatever task was given to him.  

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Rowoon shook his head slightly and asked.  

“So, why did you come?”  

“President Wang is asking for you. He’s furious because he’s not satisfied with any of the designs.”  

Rowoon seemed to understand what was going on.  

Elite designers who graduated from prestigious universities.  

But there are times when even they don’t produce satisfactory results.  

When something unconventional is needed.  

That’s when the company president would look for Rowoon.  

“Bring your notebook. If you’ve drawn something properly, I’ll give your design a chance.”  

What he wanted was a design for an exhibition.  

Although Rowoon did everything in this company.  

There was one thing.  

The president never gave Rowoon a chance to design.  

You should do work that suits your education level.  

That was President Wang’s principle, deeply rooted in his academic elitism.  

Does the president know how hard he’s worked because of his lack of education?  

It was a rare opportunity, and Rowoon felt a bit tense.  

The president began to carefully examine Rowoon’s sketches.  

-Rustle, rustle.  

The sound of turning pages echoed in his ears.  

And the president’s expression gradually hardened.  

‘How could he think of this?’  

Once again.  

Rowoon’s imagination astonished the president to the point of disbelief.  

Even giving him the opportunity to produce was an enormous favor from President Wang’s perspective.  

This uneducated orphan had come up with the best idea, outshining the designers from prestigious universities.  

Moreover, the sketches were practically flawless, considering the materials and structure.  

Rowoon hadn’t just been toiling away at the bottom for nothing.  

Even President Wang, who prided himself on his elite background, felt his pride crumble.  

“How could you call this a thought?”  

So, with a twisted heart, he spouted harsh words.  

“Then, the opportunity you mentioned…”  

“Opportunity?”  

When Rowoon asked desperately, President Wang felt a pointless stubbornness arise.  

So.  

-Rip.  

He tore the drawing in front of Rowoon’s eyes.  

“This was trash from the start.”  

Rowoon’s expression turned icy cold.  

Only Song Jaebum, standing beside them, swallowed nervously.  

**  

“And then he ended up copying your drawing?”  

Song Jaebum poured himself a shot of soju with a look of indignation.  

The president tore Rowoon’s drawing in front of his eyes, then copied it and displayed it at the exhibition.  

Rowoon bitterly smiled as he looked at the meat on the grill.  

“Why bring up something from seven years ago?”  

“Because it pisses me off. I swear, I’ll talk about this until the day I die.”  

With a face as red as the grill, Song Jaebum spoke angrily.  

It was clear that the sculpture, though similar, was an attempt to alter Rowoon’s sketch.  

The sculpture, much more ambitious than Rowoon’s sketch, eventually collapsed and caused a major accident by toppling over.  

And because of that accident, Rowoon…  

Looking at Rowoon’s still trembling right hand, Song Jaebum downed his soju in one shot.  

“And why did you jump in there, not caring if the kid got crushed or not? Are you a superhero?”  

“Should I have just left the kid to die?”  

“…Ugh!”  

Song Jaebum stuffed meat into his mouth out of frustration.  

As a third party, he was angry enough to go crazy. He couldn’t even imagine how much Rowoon’s insides were rotting over the past seven years, living with that hand.  

After some thought, Song Jaebum spoke up.  

“…At least to that kid, you’re a hero.”  

“Thanks.”  

For Rowoon, it was instinctive and reflexive.  

The child under the tilting sculpture.  

Without time to think, he threw himself, and as a result, the nerves in his hand were damaged, causing constant tremors.  

It had been seven years since he left that company with a small settlement.  

“Old man, don’t look down on me just because I lack a background. What’s the point? Look at me. I graduated from a prestigious university, but I’m stuck in a tiny print shop. What’s the use of it all?”  

“Then why did you follow me out?”  

“If I had continued designing there, it would have been hell! Don’t worry. Leaving that place brought me closer to heaven. Look, isn’t it great? Our Song Family Print Shop.”  

“You just called it a tiny print shop.”  

“Working with your parents isn’t great for your mental health.”  

“You’re all over the place. Are you bipolar?”  

Rowoon chuckled at the joke.  

Rowoon recalled the past right after injuring his hand.  

‘I’m sorry. Please look somewhere else.’  

After injuring his hand.  

Even getting manual labor was as hard as reaching for the stars.  

As an orphan who had to work to eat, the future looked bleak.  

At that time, it was Song Jaebum who extended a helping hand.  

He suggested working together at his parents’ print shop.  

Since then, Song Jaebum and Rowoon had worked together at the small print shop for seven years.  

A sole friend and a grateful benefactor.  

Rowoon swallowed his gratitude silently today as well.  

That’s when Song Jaebum asked curiously.  

“But how do you draw so well with that hand?”  

“When did you take that out?”  

Song Jaebum was already looking at Rowoon’s notebook, taken out of his bag.  

He was admiring the drawings packed inside.  

“It’s a real mystery.”  

Even as a major, he was amazed by Rowoon’s creativity.  

Clean sketches without a single eraser mark.  

Rowoon answered nonchalantly, despite Song Jaebum shaking his head.  

“It’s nothing special. Just imagine as clearly as possible.”  

“Yeah.”  

“Then put all your strength into your hand and draw in one go. Without giving your hand a chance to tremble.”  

Rowoon was telling the truth, but Song Jaebum looked incredulous.  

“…Are you kidding? Without any preliminary sketches?”  

“Yeah, just in one go. Otherwise, it takes too long.”  

Even now, Rowoon’s hand trembled like an aspen tree.  

Song Jaebum was speechless in front of the results achieved with that hand.  

“…If you had properly studied art, I feel like you wouldn’t even eat with me.”  

“Don’t worry. I’d at least drink soju with you.”  

Clink.  

Rowoon and Song Jaebum lightly clinked their soju glasses.  

Though the words came easily, there had been much hard work behind them.  

Practicing drawing straight lines with a trembling pencil, before even feeling the tremor.  

Using his left hand when it was too difficult.  

Partly because of the rehabilitation, but focusing on drawing made him feel a bit relieved.  

Song Jaebum looked at Rowoon’s right hand and asked cautiously.  

“By the way, what did the hospital say recently?”  

“They gave up. No more treatment.”  

It wasn’t that he wasn’t doing it.  

He couldn’t do it.  

After bearing the treatment costs for the hand that showed no signs of improvement,  

he was about to be evicted from his rented room.  

‘It’s time to give up on my hand.’  

As he reiterated giving up, Rowoon’s right hand trembled even more violently.  

It might have been trembling from the fear of losing hope.  

“Phew…”  

After downing a shot of soju, Rowoon slowly looked around the room.  

Traces of Rowoon’s diligent 36 years of life.  

A moldy desk picked up from somewhere.  

A refrigerator that still worked sporadically.  

The only thing that truly belonged to Rowoon among them was.  

“Only the drawings.”  

Even with his hand in such a state, the only thing he didn’t give up on was drawing.  

Rowoon let out a sigh, feeling the effects of the alcohol, and lay down on the floor.  

When it was time to give up, a strange determination made it impossible to do so.  

A feeling that everything he had suppressed until now was about to explode.  

Drawing a line on things he wanted to do but couldn’t,  

ignoring and suppressing his inner desires.  

Rowoon had ignored his dreams and desires until he realized the immense lack of art after his hand got injured.  

“Where did it go wrong?”  

He thought about it countless times.  

Was it because of the ill-fated relationship with President Wang that I ended up like this?  

No.  

I was just an easy scapegoat because I had nothing and gave up easily.  

Someone else might have gone through the same thing.  

In this harsh and cold world.  

Rowoon had no money, no connections, no family.  

“So I should have had at least a dream.”  

If I wanted to protect myself,  

I should have dreamed big with all my might.  

Not giving up because I was an orphan, but pursuing my own dreams and life.  

I should have become someone that no one could touch.  

“…”  

An irreversible past.  

A missed opportunity.  

Thinking that it was useless to regret now made him feel even more suffocated.  

The more he couldn’t, the more he wanted to.  

It was a moment when the lack of things he had given up on was about to explode.  

Just then.  

Thud.  

“Ouch.”  

Suddenly, a notebook fell on his head.  

A page opened randomly.  

It depicted the scenery of an orphanage with children running under a clear sky.  

It was a drawing Rowoon had done during his time at the orphanage.  

Rowoon silently lifted the notebook into his view.  

“I actually miss… that time.”  

Back then, he resented being alone in the world.  

He was afraid of being alone, afraid of the future.  

But now, looking back, it was a time when he could do anything.  

A time when he could dream any dream.  

“If only I had…”  

If I hadn’t given up and had drawn for myself…  

No matter the result, it wouldn’t have been as regretful as this.  

With a sigh of regret, Rowoon covered his face with the notebook.  

How much time had passed like that?  

-Chirp, chirp.  

Suddenly, the sound of birds chirping echoed in his ears.  

“…Is it morning already?”  

Rowoon slightly lifted the notebook covering his face.  

Feeling the fresh air and bright sunlight simultaneously.  

And occasionally hearing the laughter of children.  

“…?”  

Sensing something strange, Rowoon lifted his upper body.  

In front of his eyes.  

Not a drawing, but the real scenery of the orphanage unfolded.  

**  

A few days had passed, but this was definitely reality.  

“Kya-ha-ha.”  

Children running around noisily.  

A room that quickly became messy without time to organize.  

Rowoon had returned to the spring of 17 years ago.  

He kept moving his hand, which no longer trembled, back and forth.  

Seeing this, Ji-hani, an elementary schooler sharing the room, approached and asked.  

“Hyung, what’s wrong? Do you have a cramp in your hand?”  

Ji-hani found it strange as Rowoon kept fiddling with his hand.  

With curious eyes, Rowoon awkwardly replied.  

“I’m just happy.”  

“You like your own hand? That’s weird, this hyung is strange.”  

Ji-hani looked at Rowoon strangely and then ran off somewhere else.  

In truth, it was mostly awkward. Because his hand was fine.  

But just looking at his hand made him smile, and his heart felt light as if he were on a cloud.  

All the things he had suppressed and endured.  

Now he could do them.  

The opportunity to never give up and accomplish had come.  

‘I can start art again.’  

Thinking of that made his heart race with excitement, and he felt liberated from all the shackles of the world.  

Rowoon touched the calendar on the desk to confirm the date once more.  

“March 2010.”  

It was a time when he had less than a year left at the orphanage.  

A time when he worried daily about how to make a living.  

But this life, he wasn’t afraid of the future.  

Rather, he felt excited.  

Rowoon’s lips curled into a smile.  

“I should do what I want.”  

Rowoon had never formally learned art.  

But he had gained experience by toiling like a dog in this field,  

and his desire for art was stronger than anyone else’s.  

“This time, I’ll learn properly and do it right.”  

Rowoon opened an empty notebook and gripped a pencil tightly.  

This time, without giving up,  

to achieve money and fame. To obtain everything he had never had with art.
