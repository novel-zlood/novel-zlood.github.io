"Art doesn't always have to be something drawn on paper."

Lee Rowoon's recent statement had a significant impact among the club members.

Rowoon nonchalantly mentioned while looking at a biscuit shaped like the Korean letter 'ㅅ'.

"There's nothing better than snacks to capture elementary students' interest."

He believed it could maximize their concentration.

They wouldn't crush or throw their favorite snacks.

"And since it makes them think about what shapes and colors to use, it serves well as an art lesson."

Baek Iryeong thought of the colorful candy house from the fairy tale "Hansel and Gretel" she read as a child.

Stick biscuits, cookies, candies.

A fantasy candy house that seemed like it would taste sweet.

Reading that part, she had also once fantasized about a candy house.

A student from the architecture department sitting in the middle spoke up.

"If we make a house frame with snacks and use chocolate as cement!"

"Whipped cream with some viscosity instead of chocolate would work too."

"Wow, why didn't we think of using something else in art class?"

As they marveled at the ideas they hadn't thought of, someone asked Rowoon.

"How do you understand kids so well?"

Rowoon momentarily thought of the kids at the orphanage.

Especially the face of Ji-han, an elementary student who shared the same room with him.

So, he answered with a faint smile.

"I have a younger sibling."

Tak Moosuk, who knew Rowoon's circumstances, smiled warmly.

Meanwhile, others were busy admiring him.

"Indeed, wisdom from life is different."

The club members' gazes towards Rowoon had changed significantly.

Earlier, it felt more like curiosity.

Now, it was more like a bubbling sense of anticipation.

At that moment, a realistic question suddenly popped up.

"I'm a bit worried... what if the kids eat all the snacks during the lesson?"

Though it was a sweet idea, it was slightly concerning as a lesson plan.

However,

"We need to tell them in advance that they can eat it only after completing it. The kids can follow that rule."

"Really?"

"Yes. That way, they can feel a sense of accomplishment by completing their work and realize that art can be fun."

Once again, the members nodded in agreement, saying "Indeed."

"I guess it's true that specialists are different."

Those present had an interest in art and had put in their best efforts, but they weren't particularly skilled in art.

They might excel in their respective majors.

The ones related to art were,

"Come to think of it, our vice president Tak Moosuk is also from the design department, right?"

"I'm in the design department, not art education."

"I'm in aesthetics..."

Someone else made an excuse, feeling slightly pricked.

Being good at drawing and teaching it interestingly were different realms.

"That friend seems to have a talent in this area."

"Yes, he knows kids well because he has a younger sibling."

When someone said this, a few heads nodded in agreement.

It felt like they were seeing a glimpse of Charming's future.

'Is that how the conversation is going?'

Rowoon felt a bit embarrassed and scratched his neck.

Just like how a small pebble can create wide ripples on the water surface,

Rowoon's single opinion started to revive the atmosphere of the meeting.

They felt like they could conduct the class properly this time, and the kids would follow well.

Freshman Jung Saeun, who was beside Rowoon, said with sparkling eyes,

"As expected, Yooil University students are different."

"Pardon?"

"I need to work harder too."

She made a fighting gesture with her hand.

Baek Iryeong, while gazing at Rowoon, recalled what Tak Moosuk had said.

"Rowoon is a junior with his own wonderful way."

It was true.

From the first day, he had changed the atmosphere with his unique method, exceeding expectations.

Baek Iryeong cleared her throat and subtly said,

"You know I picked this new member, right?"

"I recommended Rowoon."

Tak Moosuk also had a satisfied expression.

"Anyway, this 'making a candy house' activity seems like it will be really fun!"

When someone shouted this, the atmosphere heated up again.

All that was left was to prepare for the class.

**

After the meeting ended,

Those who had time stayed back to eat together.

The pasta here was cheap, plentiful, and looked delicious at first glance.

"Wait a moment."

Tak Moosuk took out a DSLR and started taking pictures of the food.

Baek Iryeong, who seemed puzzled by this, asked,

"Tak, why are you taking pictures of the food?"

"Because I believe cooking is also a form of art we see in our daily lives."

"Alright, take as many as you want."

Click, click.

Even after a brief photo session, the food was still steaming.

Rowoon immediately picked up a fork.

The carbonara had a rich and creamy taste.

The smooth pasta had a pleasant elasticity when chewed.

Clink.

Just then, a new dish was placed in front of him.

"Since we have a new member, here's a service."

It was a complimentary dish from the owner.

"I love art, and I love the passionate Charming members even more."

The owner's affectionate eyes conveyed sincerity.

It seemed admirable and impressive that young people were coming together to volunteer through art.

"Congratulations on joining Charming. Enjoy your meal."

"Thank you."

Rowoon slightly bowed his head.

The side dish of crispy baguette topped with marinated tomatoes was fantastic.

Tak Moosuk, biting into the baguette, said with a satisfied expression,

"It's really delicious. It's surprising that it's not more known."

"Right. And it's not just because it's our hideout; the prices are really cheap, and the ingredients are fresh."

Baek Iryeong lifted a plump shrimp from her plate with a fork.

While they were eating for quite a while,

Rowoon, who was twirling pasta with an unfamiliar fork, was seen.

Baek Iryeong, noticing this, went somewhere and returned with a pair of chopsticks, placing them on the table.

"I find this more convenient too."

And she started eating her pasta silently with chopsticks.

Thanks to that, Rowoon could eat a bit more comfortably.

As they were getting full and finishing their meal,

Rowoon, looking around the slightly quiet restaurant, softly said,

"Why are there no customers here when the food is so good?"

Even during the entire meeting, there were almost no other customers besides the Charming members.

"I really don't know why either."

Baek Iryeong looked slightly worried.

Rowoon slowly looked around the restaurant.

A comfortable and cozy interior.

Tables and items that reflected the owner's taste.

Even the paintings on the walls were stylish.

It couldn't be compared to a franchise, but it wasn't lacking compared to the famous restaurants or cafes Rowoon occasionally visited while working at the print shop.

'If there's a problem...'

The exterior of the building was too old, and from the outside, it was hard to tell what the place was doing except for a small sign.

Especially since the large "Coffee" sign outside might make people think it was a café.

'There are no food photos inside the restaurant either, and the only source of information about the food is the menu.'

Rowoon looked down at the paper filled with words on the table.

People might endure such inconveniences if they know the food is good.

But there's no way for people to know the food here is good.

When he quickly searched on his phone, the few posts he found were all about coffee.

After finishing the meal,

While Baek Iryeong was paying, Rowoon cautiously asked the owner,

"Do you get many coffee customers in the restaurant?"

"Not really, but the few coffee customers we get have kept us from closing. Three years ago, after my husband retired, I tried to make a living with the cooking skills I learned while studying abroad, but I underestimated the business."

The owner, feeling comfortable with Rowoon as a member of Charming, naturally continued her candid story.

But her complexion quickly darkened.

"I think this summer will be the limit... Oh, I've said too much. Anyway, thank you for coming."

The owner, seemingly embarrassed by sharing too much, ended with a hurried greeting.

Baek Iryeong, still chewing something with puffed cheeks, said with a slightly sad face,

"This place can't close down..."

The Charming members, worried that their hideout might close, started to gather opinions outside the restaurant.

"Should we each bring our friends here once?"

"We've tried that a few times, but they found it inconvenient to come back because it's far."

"Then what should we do?"

It was a 15-minute walk from school.

It was an awkward distance to fit into lunch.

Moreover, the surroundings were full of general stores, diner-style restaurants, and factories.

The old, decrepit buildings made the street mostly empty.

It was surprising how the Charming members even found this place.

'Well, my house is nearby.'

At that moment, someone suddenly said,

"Should we make and distribute flyers?"

At that moment,

'Flyers?'

That word triggered something in Rowoon's mind.

It felt like scattered memories were coming together.

What Rowoon did countless times at the print shop was printing promotional materials.

Menus, posters, banners, various promotional items.

'Yes, those were all to promote stores.'

To inform people and increase customers.

To boost sales.

Using those promotional materials Rowoon handled daily,

'While looking for famous brands for the "Basic Graphic Design" assignment,

I thought of promotional materials as something grand.

'It's a place people can directly visit, making it perfect for display.'

He could directly apply his design.

And check the results of the changes.

A brand Rowoon could directly influence.

[Mrs. PASTA]

The name of the restaurant, written small above the entrance, caught his eye.

Mrs. Pasta.

**

As the lively guests quickly left, a silence fell over the restaurant.

The smile that had spread across the owner's face moments ago quickly faded.

"When those customers are here, it feels most like a real restaurant..."

Even a lovingly managed place, with no corner left untouched by the owner's care, felt utterly empty without customers.

She stared blankly at a painting on the wall and recalled her days studying abroad in France.

"Back then, I thought I'd live my life just painting..."

A faint smile appeared on her lips.

She had learned that her privileged family was declining while she was studying abroad.

Barely graduating by working part-time at a restaurant, she lived as a housewife until her husband retired.

"The cooking skills I learned at that restaurant are now feeding my family."

She thought about how unpredictable life was.

Sometimes, a sudden event could drastically change its course.

Some connections could become new opportunities in life.

The owner of the restaurant where she worked was a kind French grandmother.

The various dishes she taught her became the foundation of her current business.

Cooking was an art that captivated not just the eyes but also the taste and smell.

Mixing sauces, creating colors, adjusting textures.

In another sense, cooking suited her well, and fortunately, she had a talent for it.

So, three years of business after her husband's retirement to support the family.

Though the result was as it was, seeing the students' clean plates made her happy again.

"Even if I have to close the restaurant, I should serve these students delicious food until then."

This summer seemed to be the limit.

Even though the rent here was cheap for Seoul, it was hard to sustain with such low sales.

As she was cleaning the tables with a lonely heart,

A warm spring breeze seemed to enter through the restaurant door, and one of the students from earlier walked in.

"You're back. Did you leave something behind?"

But the student suddenly introduced himself.

"Ma'am, let me properly introduce myself. I'm Lee Rowoon, a freshman in the design department at Yooil University."

"Haha. Nice to meet you."

The owner found the student cute and chuckled softly.

However, Rowoon's expression was quite serious.

"I'm currently working on an assignment to design promotional materials for a brand."

"Yes."

"I'd like to choose 'Mrs. Pasta' as the subject for my assignment."

Though she didn't fully understand, she welcomed the idea of using her restaurant as a project.

It meant he liked the restaurant.

However,

"But would it be possible to implement the results in the restaurant?"

"In the restaurant?"

Hearing this, the owner hesitated.

Because she didn't know what kind of results a freshman's design would yield.

'A freshman who has only been in school for about a month...'

Even if there were few customers, it was a place where no corner was left untouched by care.

So, entrusting something related to the restaurant to a student was concerning.

Even if the student was a member of Charming and the restaurant might close soon.

'It would cost some money...'

So the owner gently turned him down.

"It's an honor that you want to use our restaurant for your assignment. But implementing it in the restaurant might be a bit difficult."

Though she clearly expressed her refusal, the student seemed to have expected it and showed no change in expression.

Instead, a confident determination sparkled in his eyes.

"Then how about I create it first and you judge after seeing the results?"
