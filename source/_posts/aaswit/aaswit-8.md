Rowoon was the first to read the word "pass," but he didn't show any reaction.

No, in fact, everything inside him was in turmoil.

‘I did it... I did it.’

A thrill that seemed to squeeze his heart.

A tingling sensation as blood rushed quickly.

A first-time electrifying feeling wrapped around his entire body.

‘An orphan doing art? What a joke.’

It was natural to think it couldn't be done.

In his previous life, even Rowoon himself thought it was impossible.

But now it was reality.

The mindset change of not giving up on anything had turned Rowoon's dreams into reality.

‘Now my future will definitely be different.’

If there was something he wanted, he would get it, no matter what.

If there was something he wanted to do, he would do it, no matter what.

Just like he proved the impossible was possible.

He would continue to live a life without giving up.

Rowoon clenched his fists tightly under the desk.

It felt as if he could almost grasp his dreams in his hands.

At that moment, a thick hand landed on Rowoon's shoulder.

“Congratulations, Rowoon junior.”

Tak Museok's heartfelt congratulations could be felt.

Then, like a dam breaking, a whirlpool of emotions surged.

Tak Museok, Director Bae of the art academy, Director Shim of the orphanage.

This life was filled with warm hands.

Without that warmth, no matter how hard he tried alone, he wouldn't have been able to achieve such results.

As his once cold heart melted, his eyes momentarily felt hot.

It was as if spring rain was falling on Rowoon's lonely and desolate life.

“Thank you so much, teacher.”

“Teacher? You are now my junior.”

“Thank you, senior.”

“Woohoooo!”

Cheers erupted from behind.

It was his academy friends surrounding him.

They patted Rowoon on the shoulder, messed up his hair.

“Congratulations on passing, Lee Rowoon!!”

“So it can be done. You're the best.”

“Wow! I have a friend in Yooil Art University!”

They sincerely congratulated him.

The positive power that the word "pass" brought was immense.

The realization that even from our academy, someone could enter Yooil Art University.

The happy delusion that they might be able to pass the schools that hadn't announced results yet.

“I’m going to take some of this energy with me!”

Kids lined up to receive the energy of passing from Rowoon.

Director Bae couldn't take his eyes off the monitor for a while and then suddenly raised his hands in a cheer as if frozen.

“Scholarship!!! Our Rowoon got a scholarship!!!”

“Oh, you scared me.”

Park Changhoon, who was nearby, rubbed one ear.

Director Bae, with his heavy bull-like body, jumped around and then clapped his hands as if he had an idea.

“Alright, Teacher Tak! Let's go put up a banner right away!”

“A banner, you say?”

“I had it printed in advance, just in case.”

He spread out a piece of cloth that had been rolled up on the desk.

[Passed Yooil Art University!!!!!! Proud Lee Rowoon 'Afternoon of Creation' 00 points]

Rowoon felt grateful for the congratulations but also slightly embarrassed by Director Bae's excessive pride.

Even Park Changhoon burst into laughter.

“Haha. Did you print this in advance?”

“Of course!”

“You look almost like Lee Rowoon's fan club holding that.”

“I need to print another one saying 'scholarship.' Hahaha!”

Other kids laughed along, and the atmosphere in the academy couldn't have been better.

**

Rowoon didn't have a family, but there was one person he really wanted to share the news with.

It was Director Shim of Hope Orphanage.

“Oh my, oh my, oh my!”

The moment she heard the news of Rowoon's acceptance, she jumped up from her seat.

Overwhelmed with joy and at a loss for words, she rushed to Rowoon and gently hugged him.

“You worked hard, well done.”

Director Shim's hand patting his back was warm.

Once again feeling the warmth of others, Rowoon felt a lump in his throat.

Having lived in an environment of solitude and unfamiliar with expressing himself.

He suddenly wanted to express his gratitude to Director Shim.

“Thank you for supporting my dream.”

She had listened seriously when Rowoon suddenly said he wanted to go to college for art.

If the director had dismissed it as a waste of time, he might have had to take a longer path.

“If I said no after seeing your drawings, I'd be a fool. I do have an eye for these things, you know?”

“Haha.”

The director, surprised by Rowoon's newfound expressiveness, responded playfully.

Then she said, as if remembering something,

“Rowoon, I think I can handle the tuition.”

She showed a sign of relief on her face.

A mysterious man who had called previously said he wanted to sponsor Rowoon depending on the results.

Since Rowoon had passed the country's top art school, Yooil Art University.

Though they would have to check, it seemed like there would be good news.

“I'll confirm it and let you know.”

“I didn't mention this earlier, but...”

Rowoon hesitated for a moment before speaking.

“I got a four-year scholarship.”

“...What?”

Seeing that Director Shim didn't quite understand, Rowoon repeated himself.

“I don't have to pay tuition for four years, as long as I don't get terrible grades.”

“Oh my! Oh my, oh my!”

Director Shim jumped up and hugged Rowoon again.

With almost a hundred children to take care of at Hope Orphanage.

It was hard to support each one individually as much as she wished.

Her best effort was to teach them to be polite and play their roles in society.

‘It felt like my fault that the kids gave up on their future...’

Seeing Rowoon achieve his goal on his own gave her hope and comfort that other kids could do it too.

Holding back tears, Director Shim smiled.

“Rowoon, we need to have a party today.”

**

Rowoon was busy preparing to leave the orphanage.

It wasn't his first time leaving, but he still felt strange.

Before, he felt like he was being kicked out because he wasn't ready.

Now, he felt excited and thrilled.

‘First, I'll use the settlement money to get a room in a goshiwon. Then I'll find a part-time job...’

At that moment, he heard the sound of someone running from afar.

It was Jihan, his roommate.

Jihan, with flushed cheeks, shouted excitedly.

“Hyung! Come down to the director’s office quickly. Someone is here to see you.”

“Someone is here to see me?”

If someone came to the orphanage, it was usually a volunteer or family.

But the person in front of Rowoon was a young man he had never seen before.

Dressed in a black suit and black sunglasses.

He didn't look like a volunteer at all.

After a moment of awkward silence, the man spoke first.

“I heard you passed Yooil Art University. Congratulations.”

“Thank you.”

‘Who is this guy who came all the way here to congratulate me?’

A hidden relative? If there were such a person, they would have looked for him at least once in the past.

While Rowoon was trying to figure out the situation, the man spoke again.

“I became interested after seeing your painting at the competition in Himchan Park last March.”

“Ah...!”

At this point, Rowoon had a feeling the man might be a sponsor.

He recalled Director Shim mentioning that the tuition might be taken care of.

“I was planning to sponsor your tuition, but since you have a scholarship, I thought of another plan.”

“Another plan?”

“I will support your living expenses based on the results you produce in the future.”

“...!”

Rowoon's eyes widened in surprise.

Director Shim, beside him, was also speechless.

“The evaluation will be based on the results of the previous semester.”

“...”

“This semester, as a welcome gift, I will deposit five million won.”

“Oh my!”

Director Shim exclaimed with joy.

She had been worried about Rowoon's independence even after the tuition was covered.

Though shocked by the continuous surprising news, Rowoon asked calmly,

“Can I really accept this?”

It was hard to believe a large amount of sponsorship money from a stranger.

Instead of answering, the man handed over a small white envelope.

“Another gift for entering Yooil Art University.”

Rowoon took out a heavy box from the envelope and was astonished.

It was the latest smartphone.

An expensive model he had never had before.

“Great. You’ll definitely need this moving forward.”

Director Shim rejoiced beside him.

But Rowoon still couldn't believe all of this.

‘Why are they doing this for me?’

He had never believed in Santa Claus, but he thought the man in the black suit might be Santa.

Reading Rowoon's expression, the man spoke seriously.

“This is not an unexpected fortune. It is the result of your excellence. In the world, there is always a cause and effect.”

Rowoon swallowed his saliva and asked calmly,

“May I know your name?”

But the man remained silent for a moment before speaking.

“I can't tell you the details, but if you continue to produce good results, you will eventually find out.”

“Ah...”

“Enjoy your college life.”

With that, the man left in a luxurious black car without revealing his name or identity.

In a past life of being alone, losing both time and money.

Now, people kept showing kindness.

As Director Shim watched the car leave, she gently patted Rowoon’s back.

“There are many good people in the world. Do your best in college.”

Words that once felt meaningless.

They now had genuine significance.

Blessings come to those who work hard.

The world seemed more livable than he thought.

A few days later.

The day Rowoon left the orphanage arrived.

“Hyuuuung.”

Jihan, his roommate, cried as he said goodbye.

It wasn't like this before.

Maybe something different about Rowoon had touched Jihan’s heart.

‘Before, I was too busy to care about Jihan.’

Now, he felt he should visit the orphanage often.

To show the kids living a life of easy surrender that they didn’t have to.

He wanted to show them a life where things could be done.

To prove it with his own life and help them someday.

Just like the warm hands he had received in this life.

So he lowered his posture and said to Jihan,

“I’ll come back to see you during vacations.”

“Really?”

“Of course. This is my home.”

At the word "home," Director Shim wiped her tears, and the other kids smiled faintly.

Jihan, wiping his tears and snot, hooked his pinky with Rowoon's.

“Goodbye, hyung! I'll listen to the director well!”

**

Vroom.

The express bus roared as it sped down the road.

The view of the village where he had lived for 20 years disappeared outside the window.

‘Though it’s only been about a year since I returned.’

His luggage was light.

All of Rowoon's belongings fit into one backpack.

Tapping the backpack, he felt its soft contents.

Mostly clothes.

He had rented a half-jeonse room near the school.

Originally, he planned to stay in a goshiwon, but thanks to the five million won from the mysterious man, his situation improved.

Having left early in the morning, it was around lunchtime when he arrived at his destination.

Gray, low buildings that looked like they might collapse at any moment.

Old shops packed tightly on the first and second floors.

It was a neighborhood about a 20-minute walk from the school.

From rice plate shops to general stores, ironworks, and woodworking shops, everything was packed, but there was no one on the streets.

Clatter, clatter, clatter.

“Cough, cough.”

Occasionally, a motorcycle or truck spewing exhaust was all there was.

With processing shops, there was noise and bad air.

But Rowoon chose this place because:

‘It’s a relief to find a cheap place near school.’

And because it was a somewhat familiar neighborhood.

While working in a sculpture company, he had scoured the area for cheap and good materials.

If he needed materials for assignments, it would be convenient due to the close distance.

Rowoon looked around the neighborhood, which was quite different from what he remembered, and arrived at the real estate office.

“Are you sure this place is okay?”

“Yes, I like it.”

Entering the second floor of an old shopping center, bright sunlight streamed through the window. Despite the price, it was spacious and comfortable.

It had everything needed, like a bathroom and sink, even though it was a small ten-pyeong space with no separate rooms.

“Originally, this was used as an office, so I was worried, but if you like it, that’s good.”

The real estate agent scratched at an 'Employment Office' sticker on the window with his fingernail but failed and said,

“Oh, this is stuck outside the window. This used to be an employment office.”

“I’ll remove it later when I have time.”

“Okay. But when are your moving things arriving?”

“Later.”

Actually, this backpack was all his moving things.

After the real estate agent left, standing alone in the empty space felt strange.

Maybe it was awkward being alone after always being in the bustling orphanage, or maybe it was the excitement of starting a new life in Seoul.

Anyway, it was a space to fill with things truly his in this life.

“Let’s buy the essentials after school tomorrow.”

Rowoon unpacked the small amount of belongings and began a simple cleaning.

And tomorrow was the official day to go to school.

It was the orientation day for the design department.
