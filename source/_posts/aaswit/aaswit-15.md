‘...What is this?’

He had a strange feeling.

It was because the way Rowoon moved his hand was not ordinary.

A graduate student leaned closer to Rowoon's drawing.

Drawing a perfect form straight away without any preliminary sketch.

‘Seems like he knows how to draw?’

Dashing in a straight line and then boldly taking a curve.

Capturing all the large forms and then swiftly adding details.

Rowoon's hand movements were unhesitant, as if he had run this track countless times.

Because of that, the graduate students who used to look at him as just a first-year student began to see him differently.

Professor Jihwasan smirked inwardly.

‘I knew this kid was different from the beginning.’

He recognized it from the drawing Rowoon submitted for the entrance exam.

How peculiar this kid was.

But seeing him draw in person, he realized Rowoon was even more extraordinary than he had thought.

It felt like watching a naturally talented amateur running with all their might.

Yet, there was a certain sense of potential.

Beyond talent, Rowoon's passion for art seemed to run deeper than expected.

A graduate student wearing a cap watched Rowoon's drawing with interest.

‘So, what is he drawing?’

To be honest, the way he sketched in one go was fascinating, making it unexpectedly enjoyable to watch.

Watching an undergraduate trying hard was both cute and pitiful.

Because he thought Rowoon was overexerting himself.

To show something, anything.

But.

‘Wait, this is strange?’

The graduate student furrowed his brows.

Because Rowoon's drawing was starting to take on a plausible shape.

Showing signs of being taught at an art academy.

Not an impossible drawing, but a real design.

He was drawing a practical structure that looked like it could be used right away.

At that point, the graduate student, sensing that something was off, leaned closer to the drawing.

Rowoon was drawing a coffee pot.

Referring to the concept they had planned.

Just an ordinary coffee pot.

But the strange feeling started from there.

‘...!’

Rowoon's hand suddenly darted to an unexpected place.

‘What is he doing?’

The body of the coffee pot.

He drew a long vertical line above it.

Looking closely, he was drawing a transparent window inside it.

So that the amount of liquid inside the coffee pot could be checked.

‘But why is he putting that there?’

The graduate student was surprised because the position of that window was a bit unexpected.

They had drawn that window in their sketch too.

In a position visible when the handle was held with the right hand.

But Rowoon was extending the window all around the body of the coffee pot to the opposite side.

So that it would be intuitively visible no matter which hand, left or right, held the handle.

“...!”

The first person to notice the intention was Jihwasan.

‘Originally, left-handers wouldn't have been able to see it!’

He had extended it to the field of view of left-handers.

And made it look sophisticated in terms of design.

‘Small differences in design can change lifestyles.’

The way one lifts the handle changes depending on its shape.

The consumer's actions change depending on where the button is placed.

In that way, existing inconveniences can be improved.

From a very small design change.

‘Discovering that small detail is the hardest part...’

It was the same even for the veteran Jihwasan.

That familiar spot that he naturally overlooked.

The part that he hadn't realized was a problem because he had been digging deep into one area.

A first-year student had discovered it.

A small but unprecedented detail.

Jihwasan suppressed his bubbling excitement and stared straight at Rowoon's drawing.

Because he wanted to see his drawing until the end.

“It's done.”

At that moment, Jihwasan saw a white finish line fluttering in his vision.

The thrilling sketched marathon was over.

His fingers holding the mechanical pencil were tingling from how focused he had been.

But the three people sitting in front of Rowoon didn't move at all.

They still couldn't take their eyes off Rowoon's drawing.

One of the graduate students slowly raised his head.

“Are you left-handed?”

He used to be in the past.

“No, I use both hands.”

“But how did you come up with this detail...?”

Because he had the perspective of having lived as a left-hander.

But he didn't bother to bring up the past.

As soon as the slight excitement subsided.

Professor Jihwasan glanced at the still-dazed graduate students.

“What do you think? From your perspective.”

The graduate student holding Rowoon's sketch, after analyzing the structure, started to speak.

“Isn't it much better to fix it this way? It's also in line with the concept in terms of design.”

The indifferent expression from earlier was nowhere to be seen, and his focus was clearly on Rowoon's sketch.

Because this was much closer to a 'design for everyone.'

‘This is why Professor Ji liked him.’

He was definitely not an ordinary person.

Reflecting on his own first-year days made it even more evident.

No matter how tight the deadline was, he couldn't just overlook a clear direction for improvement.

“It would be better to review all the other products as well. From this friend's perspective. Even if we tweak the design details a bit.”

It was Jihwasan who suggested including Rowoon in the project,

Now, it was the graduate students who wanted it.

Jihwasan looked back at Rowoon and said.

“You, what do you think? Now it looks like you can't back out of this project with us. We'll put your name in the report and give you part-time pay.”

Thus, as the last runner in this project relay,

Rowoon was officially recruited.

**

“Urat-cha-cha-cha!”

Professor Jihwasan stretched with a refreshing sound.

“It's finally over.”

Thanks to wrestling with it for several days, they had just sent the requested report via email.

As a result, even the graduate students let out a refreshing sigh.

“Ha, it was really nerve-wracking, but the final touch-up made it much better.”

Not only the coffee pot but also the rice cooker and blender.

By complementing the usability for left-handers in more detail, the overall quality of the products seemed to have been elevated.

Rowoon's advice was a big help.

Thanks to his thorough review from a left-hander's perspective.

“Having Rowoon join at the last minute was a godsend.”

The tall graduate student, Ok Dalsu, said.

Despite his slightly rough appearance, he turned out to be an amiable person.

“Rowoon's sketch speed also played a part. Sha-sha-shak!”

This time, the graduate student wearing a cap, Shin Kihun, mimicked drawing in the air.

Because of his long hair, his back view looked like a noona's.

Although he was a bit jumpy, he wasn't annoying.

Rowoon was also satisfied with joining this project.

‘Feels like I did something representing left-handers.’

Living as a left-hander involved more inconveniences than one might think.

The range of products to choose from was limited, or there were no left-handed products at all.

Especially around this time.

‘But this home appliance brand is good value for its quality.’

If Rowoon's opinion was reflected and the product was launched, it would be like expanding the choice range for left-handers much faster.

Unlike the past.

At that moment, Jihwasan, who was resting on the sofa, raised his eyebrows.

“Didn't I tell you he's not an ordinary kid? The way he speaks his mind without flinching in front of the professor and graduate students.”

“Hahaha, that's right.”

The graduate students burst into laughter.

“Me?”

Rowoon scratched his head awkwardly, and Jihwasan laughed heartily.

The look in Jihwasan's eyes as he watched Rowoon was meaningful.

From the fact that he could handle such difficult topics as an undergraduate,

To his ability to maintain the big picture while paying attention to small details, as if he had real-world experience.

He had played a role beyond expectations when he initially thought of including him in the project.

He had thought of using him just for some fresh ideas and to help organize the report.

‘I'm curious about his capacity.’

He couldn't help but wonder how he would handle something a notch more difficult.

It was always good to experience things quickly if one had the ability.

‘That way, he'll grow faster than others.’

Moreover, Rowoon's passion for art seemed extraordinary, making him want to challenge him even more.

‘If this kid ends up doing visual design later, I might feel a bit jealous.’

Jihwasan rubbed his lower abdomen for no reason.

In the third year, he would have to choose between industrial design and visual design for his major, and he was worried he might choose visual.

Ok Dalsu, noticing this, asked.

“Professor, are you hungry?”

“Not really. Hey, how about we go eat some pork cutlet to celebrate the end of our project?”

Jihwasan's favorite food was pork cutlet.

At the faculty restaurant inside the school.

Four sturdy men sliced pork cutlet.

The crispy, golden pork cutlet was sliced pleasantly with a knife.

Picking up a piece and putting it in his mouth felt like heaven.

‘The faculty restaurant food is better.’

At that moment of great realization,

Rowoon, sensing Jihwasan's subtle gaze, asked.

“Professor, what's wrong?”

He grinned and suddenly started talking.

“Come to think of it, you are very much like me in my younger days.”

“What?”

“I mean it. It's like looking in a mirror while eating.”

He chewed his food happily.

The more he thought, the more he liked Rowoon.

Although he was more of a troublemaker back in his school days.

Rowoon merely smiled, while Shin Kihun, sitting beside him, tilted his head.

“Sssss.”

“Why, what's your problem?”

“Professor, it's awkward to say this, but I think there's a big difference in height.”

Jihwasan was on the shorter side, while Rowoon was taller.

Seemingly annoyed, Jihwasan snapped.

“This guy is funny. Give me that, you punk.”

He roughly snatched a piece of pork cutlet from Shin Kihun's plate.

“Hey, professor! Even dogs don't disturb others when they're eating.”

“I don't care about that, punk.”

Shin Kihun paid a high price for his straightforwardness.

The atmosphere between the professor and his students seemed more harmonious than one would expect.

Despite being as fierce as a tiger during class, Jihwasan had a human touch up close.

Of course, other classmates might not believe this fact.

At that moment, Jihwasan's attention returned to Rowoon.

He swallowed his food and then spoke.

“By the way, what are you more interested in, industrial design or visual design?”

The graduate students also subtly focused on this question.

Since they had chosen the industrial path, they were curious about Rowoon's preference.

Rowoon pondered for a moment and then said.

“It's about the same for now. I'm just starting to learn.”

“Haha, right?”

Professor Ji laughed awkwardly.

He must have hoped for an answer favoring industrial design.

He was deep in thought while eating and suddenly spoke.

“By the way, do you have any plans for a part-time job?”

“A part-time job?”

“Do you know about work-study students?”

“Yes, working within the school and getting paid in the form of a scholarship.”

He had heard about it from seniors.

It was said to be a great part-time job, working in various school facilities.

The working hours could be adjusted, and the tasks were easy, making it ideal to balance with assignments.

Since it required only moving within the school, it was efficient in terms of time.

‘But I heard the application period ended before the semester started.’

That meant there were no opportunities for freshmen.

Rowoon blinked, waiting for his next words.

“Our lab needs a work-study student.”

“Our lab?”

Shin Kihun reacted as if hearing it for the first time.

“Yes, I think we need one. Just to clean the lab and organize documents. Only twice a week.”

Of course, he had just made it up.

He had his reasons for wanting Rowoon to work part-time in the lab.

By frequently visiting the lab, Rowoon might develop more interest in industrial design.

‘Sometimes, learning by observing over the shoulder is helpful.’

He waited for Rowoon's response.

For some reason, he was very curious.

But Rowoon didn't ponder for long.

He hadn't found a part-time job anyway.

“Yes, I'll do it.”

“Well, you've made a good decision.”

A satisfied smile spread across Jihwasan's face.

“Then let's start from tomorrow.”
