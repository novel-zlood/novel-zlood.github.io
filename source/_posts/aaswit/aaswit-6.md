It must have been because it was vacation, the school visible outside the car window looked desolate.

It might have been because the sleet was creating white voids here and there in the school.

A red compact car passed the slippery slope and entered the underground parking lot.

Screech—squeak.

As it turned the curve with a loud noise, he finally saw the people who had come for the practical test.

"Alright, let's get out."

From that moment, Director Bae felt a slight pang in his stomach.

The entrance exam was not just a competition for the kids.

There was competition between the academies, and even within the same academy, there was competition between branches.

Seeing the large buses from each academy lined up gave him a slight sense of intimidation.

Director Bae worried if Rowoon might have lost his confidence.

If the academy was a puddle, this place was nothing less than the ocean.

With Rowoon's skills, there was no need to be intimidated, but perhaps just being in Seoul might have made him extremely nervous.

"Rowoon, don't worry. Just do as you usually do."

Fortunately, contrary to his worries, Rowoon seemed calm.

Rather, his eyes looked even sharper.

It seemed like he wasn't nervous about taking the test but rather felt a slight sense of excitement.

Director Bae felt that Rowoon seemed a bit unfamiliar, as he didn't seem like a typical kid of his age.

Finally, the three men stood under the tall building where the test was being held.

"You can do it. Don't be nervous."

The lips of Tak Moosuk, who said this, were turning purple.

He looked like a rock on the outside, but it seemed like he had cream inside.

"Don't worry. I'll do my best as you taught me."

It was Rowoon who reassured them, making the expressions of the two men slightly brighter.

Just as they were about to enter the building.

"Oh my, what brings Director Bae here?"

A middle-aged man approached and greeted Director Bae.

Judging by the students following him, he seemed to be the director of another branch.

Director Bae tried to act nonchalant, but his cow-like eyes flinched.

"I came because I have a student applying to Yuil Arts University, why else?"

"Does the headquarters just let you apply?"

He looked at Director Bae and Rowoon up and down as if he was surprised.

For the academy, the number of students who get into college is important.

Especially in the case of Yuil Arts University, they even managed the percentage of successful applicants among the preparatory students.

The headquarters had a guideline that if the acceptance rate wasn't 100%, they shouldn't prepare.

"They'll complain that the acceptance rate is dropping. Yuil Arts University is sensitive about that."

The middle-aged man acted slyly as if he was worried.

There was also a reason to boost the morale of the students next to him, even if it meant engaging in childish power struggles.

Since psychological influence is significant in drawing.

It was the attitude of at least boosting the morale of their students if they couldn't get in anyway.

As expected.

A male student next to him gave a slight chuckle.

'But that expression...'

That unique expression when making fun of others.

He certainly remembered seeing it somewhere.

'Got it.'

It was from the time when he worked at a sculpture company.

One of the many clients he encountered back then.

The designer guy they called Assistant Manager Yoon.

'Meeting him again like this.'

There was a sequence to things, but this guy always hurried and often disrespected Rowoon, saying things like, "This is why you can't communicate with people who didn't go to college."

'Was this guy a Yuil Arts University graduate?'

He didn't know about that, but it felt peculiar to meet a future nuisance like this.

Director Bae's displeased voice was heard from the yet unresolved argument.

"Isn't the judgment on acceptance rates up to the director? I'll take responsibility for it, so don't worry about it."

"Oh my. How can I not worry when we're under the same franchise? No matter how much I raise the acceptance rate, what good does it do if there's someone lowering it?"

"Ha ha, Director Kim, you're being overly confident. Who will raise or lower the acceptance rate is something we'll know only after the results are out, right?"

Director Bae's composed response, smiling without falling for the provocation.

He seemed so confident that he couldn't help but look at Rowoon next to him once more.

'He looks just fine on the outside, so he must be good at drawing, huh?'

Director Kim raised his eyebrows.

There was no way Director Bae, who had never successfully sent a student to Yuil Arts University, could make it this time.

Meanwhile, Director Bae thought there was no point in prolonging the situation and hurried Rowoon into the building.

"Don't worry and go on your way. We're busy too. Rowoon, it's cold, so go in quickly."

Director Bae and Tak Moosuk waved at Rowoon.

"I'll do well."

As if he found the childish quarrel amusing.

With a short smile on his lips, Rowoon disappeared into the building.

**

Inside the test room, there was a dense sense of silence.

From the moment he entered the test room through the front door, he felt others scanning him.

As he quietly found his assigned seat, he saw a familiar face sitting right in front of him.

'Song Jaebum!'

It was his oldest friend, Song Jaebum.

The last time they had soju together was before he returned.

It had been about 10 months since he last saw him, after living together every day at his parents' printing shop.

He could feel Jaebum pretending not to see him while observing him.

Rowoon found his youthful face unfamiliar yet funny, making him laugh a bit.

But he managed his expression and sat down.

'Don't be so nervous, you'll pass, you rascal.'

Like meeting an ally on the battlefield he had fought alone until now, Rowoon felt happy.

He was like family to Rowoon.

One of the reasons Rowoon wanted to get into Yuil Arts University was because of Song Jaebum.

Although Jaebum always lamented about the futility of graduating from a prestigious university, the nostalgic stories he told were vivid.

'There was this really eccentric professor who did crazy things during class, you know?'

'One senior only did weird projects, and later on... you never know with people.'

The outrageous things that happened in classes and the futures of his peers.

Although he was a talkative friend, listening to those stories always made the boring work hours fly by.

Since then, Rowoon had wanted to attend such a university at least once.

Thinking about spending time together at that school, which he had heard about like oral traditions, made him slightly excited.

As the remaining empty seats were almost filled.

The future Assistant Manager Yoon, who had sneered at Rowoon earlier in front of the building, entered the test room.

Step, step.

And he sat next to Rowoon.

He glanced at Rowoon and made the same annoying expression.

But without paying attention to that, the test supervisor soon announced the start of the test.

"While I distribute the drawing paper and instructions, I'll write the topic on the board."

Yuil Arts University emphasized creativity the most.

And they valued how effectively one could convey that idea to others.

Rowoon recalled what Tak Moosuk had told him.

'They hate students who draw from memory, so they're famous for giving bizarre tests.'

They would give twisted topics or make them fold the paper to draw, preventing them from using memorized patterns.

Because of this, there was always a lot of talk and controversy, but what could you do when it was the best art university in Korea?

You had no choice but to practice dealing with various unexpected situations.

Rowoon had also prepared with various topics along with Tak Moosuk.

'If you can't grasp the intention of the question, no matter how well you draw, they won't select you.'

Rowoon once again recalled what he had said.

Screech—screech.

With the friction sound of the whiteboard, everyone's eyes in the classroom turned to the tip of the supervisor's pen.

And what was written there.

[Topic]

Express the beginning and the end.

'It's simpler than I thought.'

Everyone looked relieved when the topic was announced.

It was simple enough to fit into the drawings they had practiced so far.

But Rowoon thought differently.

'There must be something more.'

"Then we will start the practical test now."

The supervisor said loudly.

"Everyone, turn over your drawing papers."

"...?"

The students who were about to start sketching looked bewildered.

"Turn over the drawing papers?"

"Yes. Please turn them over immediately."

They were puzzled about why they were asked to turn over the drawing papers.

But the students grabbed the edges of the paper.

And rustle, rustle.

The sound of turning papers filled the test room.

But.

"?!"

On the back of the blank drawing paper.

There were two large circles drawn.

Because of that, low murmurs of confusion like "What?" and "What is this?" spread.

Rowoon quickly checked the printout the supervisor had handed out.

[Conditions]

- Use the provided paper horizontally.

- Utilize the two drawn shapes.

- You can freely color inside and outside the shapes.

It was about using the already drawn circles to express the theme of 'beginning and end.'

Even if they had practiced similar topics, the conditions made it impossible to fit them in.

'I knew it.'

Rowoon liked the restrictions that stimulated his sense of challenge.

Overcoming something that seemed impossible with a good idea.

That was the charm of design.

On the other hand, the surrounding students sighed deeply.

They had to find an effective way to express it with a type they had never experienced before.

The battle was starting now.

Soon, the fierce sounds of pencils and erasers rubbing were heard, and while everyone was racking their brains.

Swoosh.

The future Assistant Manager Yoon, sitting next to him, suddenly stood up from his seat.

He stood up to sketch so that the drawing paper could be seen at a glance.

Since the design practical was conducted at desks, it was to prevent distortion of shapes.

Seeing that, the other students started to get nervous.

'Already... I haven't thought of anything yet.'

That was exactly the effect Assistant Manager Yoon aimed for.

To grab the pencil as quickly as possible to establish dominance.

A thrilling sensation passed through his neck as if he had already gained the upper hand.

But it was the same back when he worked with him before the return.

No matter how much Assistant Manager Yoon rushed him, Rowoon always adhered to his standards.

The important thing was the completeness of the sculpture.

So while the students were racking their brains under the pressure of falling behind.

Rowoon was silently focusing on developing his idea right next to him.

'Let's think about the intention of the question.'

The first thing that came to mind was to use objects that were circular in shape to directly express the beginning and end.

For example, filling the circles with objects like balls or clocks to represent the beginning and end respectively.

In fact, the students who had already started drawing were developing their ideas in this way.

Even Assistant Manager Yoon was drawing soccer balls in each circle.

In one, he was depicting kicking the ball, and in the other, he was showing the ball going into the goal.

'The theme of beginning and end is conveyed.'

But because of the composition where the two circular objects were placed side by side, it felt quite artificial no matter what was drawn around them.

It felt more like a specific purpose-driven image rather than a 'painting' you appreciated aesthetically.

Moreover, the ball that had absorbed force would inevitably deform, but the perfectly round soccer ball just looked like it was floating.

In many ways, it was a drawing that wouldn't make sense without an explanation about the specific conditions.

Finally, Rowoon clearly realized the intention of the question.

'The key is to naturally incorporate the two circles, which look unnatural at first glance, into the drawing while making the theme stand out.'

Even Song Jaebum in front of him was naturally linking the two circles with the Olympic rings to express the opening and closing ceremonies.

It was a unique approach that made it look so natural that you couldn't tell where the circles were originally drawn.

'As expected, the successful candidate is different.'

Now, almost all the students were standing up and sketching.

But Rowoon remained still until he came up with an idea he was satisfied with.

Countless ideas flashed through his mind.

Ideas connected one after another, and new thoughts branched out unexpectedly.

'But not yet.'

Until he came up with an idea that he absolutely wanted to draw.

Rowoon expanded his thoughts like a web.

It was a habit he had developed to reduce failures when drawing with a trembling hand in the past.

Since he had the ability to draw what he envisioned immediately, he had enough time.

But it didn't seem that way to others.

'Why isn't he drawing yet?'

The supervisor approached to check if there was a problem with Rowoon.

But at that very moment.

Rowoon picked up his pencil.

It was one second before his idea took shape.
