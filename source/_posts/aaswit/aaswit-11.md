Rowoon lifted the paper that Tak Moosuk handed him.

- Art Volunteer Club Charming.

The two words "Charming" were clearly written on the application form.

Tak Moosuk asked, "Have you ever thought about volunteering?"

"No," Rowoon replied.

Frankly, what reason would an orphan have to think about volunteering? 

Still, there was some connection.

Living in the orphanage, there were many occasions when volunteers would visit. 

Some organizations would come to cut hair or cook meals.

To be honest, he felt gratitude, but he also viewed them as people from a different world meddling in his life.

Because his already wounded heart couldn't accept everything at face value.

However, when Rowoon returned and tried to do something, 

If it weren't for those meddling hands, he would have had to take a much longer route.

It was only when he grasped those unconditional hands that he realized their warmth.

Another person who had helped Rowoon without any conditions was Tak Moosuk.

Tak Moosuk began to explain seriously.

"Charming is the art volunteer club I'm part of. It's a joint club with Seohan University nearby. We do children's art education, mural volunteering, and various other activities."

"The day we first met, were you also doing Charming activities?"

"Yes, that's right."

Tak Moosuk recalled the first time he met Rowoon at an event.

"I liked your determination to try something."

Most kids in the same situation as Rowoon had completely shut off their desire to try anything.

But Rowoon was eager to try and had a strong will to challenge himself.

So, he thought it might be good to do this work together with Rowoon.

Volunteering seems like helping others, but in fact, it's a process of helping oneself.

"By meeting people through volunteering and experiencing numerous challenges, we can all become better individuals."

He remembered the first time he met Rowoon.

Although he was burning with ambition, his expression had noticeably become more lively now.

Rowoon, who was smart and talented in art, if he also had a warm heart, 

What kind of designer would he become?

He couldn't help but look forward to it.

"Wouldn't you be able to join us with a sincere heart?"

Since it was a popular club, they had to be very careful in selecting members.

In that sense, someone who excelled in art and could genuinely commit to this work.

Rowoon was the perfect fit.

"Of course, I can't force you if you don't want to. But I really hope you join."

Tak Moosuk closed his mouth firmly after saying that.

As if waiting for Rowoon's answer.

Although there were many benefits to the club besides volunteering, he intentionally didn't mention those.

He didn't want to lure Rowoon into joining.

He wanted to leave the choice entirely up to him.

After contemplating for a while, Rowoon spoke carefully.

"Academic credits and part-time jobs are important to me. As you know, I have to work several times harder than others."

"…I understand."

Tak Moosuk nodded with a feeling of regret.

It should never be forced.

But.

"So, if I can keep what I must protect…"

"…"

"I want to try."

Tak Moosuk was very surprised to understand Rowoon's words.

"Really?"

"Yes."

This time, he wanted to live a colorful life.

He had enough experience from his previous life of being buried in work.

‘If I try and it doesn't work out, I can just quit. Why limit myself already?’

Frankly, others were clamoring to get in.

An orphan volunteering? It might sound funny, but there was no reason he couldn't do it.

If he wanted to try, he should just do it.

‘And since they said there are various art activities.’

Still too much of a freshman to achieve something in art.

If there was a place to use his talent until then, it wouldn't be bad.

He didn't know how much his ability would help the volunteer club.

Tak Moosuk, slightly flushed with excitement, said with a slightly reddened face.

"If you're worried about assignments and livelihood, you can come only when there's an activity you want to participate in. But can I ask one favor from our side?"

"A favor?"

"To join our club, you need to go through the president once more. Because many people intend to join with different intentions, we have set up a formal procedure, so please understand."

In other words, an additional interview was necessary.

With the vice president's recommendation, it would almost be a pass.

"Sure, I don't mind."

"But I assure you, joining our club will be a great help to you too."

Confidence was evident in Tak Moosuk's expression.

**

On the way back to the professor's office.

Professor Eunsung Yeon was deep in thought.

Because there was something surprising in the first-year 'Basic Graphic Design' class just now.

Professor Eun had assigned a task for students to combine several photos into one to help them learn the basics of the tool.

And the student named Lee Rowoon, who had made an impression in the first class,

Had created an assignment that was perfect as if it had originally been one photo.

Like a professional.

'It seems he's not just strong in theory.'

A student who excelled in both theory and practice.

She had a feeling that the type of designer she wanted might come from the class of 2011.

At that moment, the door of Professor Jihwasan's lab across the hall burst open.

"Professor Eun, are you coming back from class?"

"Yes, are you doing well with the new project you were commissioned for?"

"Oh, don't even mention it. I stayed up all night yesterday. But it's starting to take shape now."

Professor Jihwasan stretched and then suddenly asked,

"How's that kid in the first year?"

"Who are you talking about?"

"You know, the top student of the class of 2011."

Professor Eun immediately thought of Rowoon.

"Lee Rowoon? You couldn't attend the first class last week, right?"

"Yes, I had my assistant do the orientation and announcements."

Professor Ji had an official schedule and couldn't participate in the first class.

So he asked about the student he had strongly pushed to be the top student.

He was curious about the student who had drawn that peculiar picture, but Professor Eun only gave a teasing answer with an elegant smile.

"You have the next class. Why don't you see for yourself?"

Meanwhile, during the break.

Students were gathered in groups making small talk.

From Rowoon's group, Song Jaebum's voice could be heard.

"Still, being the son of a print shop owner, the basic graphic class is a bit easier. But how do you guys handle the tools so well already?"

Song Jaebum looked at Rowoon with genuine curiosity.

But he couldn't say that he learned it at Jaebum's print shop before returning.

"…Just somehow."

"Anyway, if you need to print something later, come to our shop. I'll give you a classmate discount."

"Thanks, I'll benefit from that."

Rowoon smiled, thinking of Song Jaebum's parents.

"By the way, isn't the next class with Professor Jihwasan? Did you hear what the only required material for his class is?"

"What is it?"

"A mindset that won't be sad if criticized."

"Do we have to prepare to be criticized already?"

Han Daye laughed as if she wasn't expecting that.

"It's true, the seniors said so. Everyone gets criticized to different degrees."

"If it's because we did poorly, we should accept it. If you don't want to be criticized in the future, you just have to do better."

"What's with that inhumane line?"

But since what she said was so correct, no one could refute it.

Rowoon already knew about that professor from the stories Song Jaebum had told in the past.

He had told several stories about a quirky professor.

"Hmm, hmm."

With a low clearing of the throat, Professor Jihwasan appeared.

From the way he entered with his hands behind his back, it was already unusual.

The students, facing the intimidating presence of Professor Ji, whom they had seen in occasional magazine interviews, straightened up.

Without any greeting, he immediately started calling the roll.

After going through several names in alphabetical order,

"Lee Rowoon."

He slightly raised his head to confirm Rowoon's face.

The moment his bloodshot eyes, from staying up all night, met Rowoon's.

'Yes, those eyes!'

The blood vessels in his eyes seemed to stand out even more.

The madness in those bloodshot eyes was enough to scare the freshmen.

Coupled with his infamous reputation as heard from the seniors.

So, most students avoided making eye contact while he called the roll.

Except for two people.

'The one sitting in the front is the top student, Lee Rowoon. And next to him is the second top student, Han Daye. Birds of a feather flock together.'

Han Daye seemed not to fear him due to her strong nerves,

While Rowoon's eyes were filled with a fierce desire to learn quickly.

The keen eyes of the old man in the picture Rowoon had drawn for the entrance exam.

The intense curiosity and desire in those eyes were vividly visible in Rowoon.

Professor Ji smirked with satisfaction and strolled to the front of the classroom.

"What do you think is the most important thing in design?"

"Aesthetics!"

"Practicality."

"User convenience!"

Perhaps spurred by Rowoon's advanced answer from the previous class, the classmates had studied in advance and competed to answer.

They behaved like students of a prestigious university.

Professor Jihwasan asked another question.

"Then why do you want to do design?"

Again, various answers poured out.

"Because I want to be a character designer."

"I want to create my own products."

"I want to communicate with the public through design."

Professor Jihwasan stopped in front of Han Daye, who hadn't answered, and stared at her face.

"And you, why do you want to do design?"

Just from her eyes, he could tell she wasn't an ordinary student.

She showed no sign of tension even as he walked back and forth in front of her.

Han Daye calmly shared her honest thoughts.

"For my freedom."

"Freedom? That's an interesting reason."

Entering the prestigious arts university was already decided by her father.

To receive less control, she had bargained for a practice-oriented major, which was design.

She had no dreams she wanted to achieve through design.

After graduation, she would have to live according to her father's plan anyway.

But rather than concocting a plausible answer, she seemed to honestly state her own reason, and Professor Ji moved on to the next person.

"And you?"

In fact, this was the final stop for Professor Ji's questions.

Why did someone with such eyes enter this department?

Rowoon thought for a moment and answered honestly.

"Because it's a practical and rational form of art."

Rowoon had a deep-seated grudge against art before his return, and design was a rational way to make money while doing art.

"In other words, you want to make money with your artistic sense?"

Professor Jihwasan immediately understood the underlying meaning and Rowoon did not deny it.

With a smile, he alternately looked at Rowoon and Han Daye.

"One for money, the other for freedom."

The classmates, tense and wondering if Professor Ji would be offended by their brutally honest answers,

But what came out of Jihwasan's mouth was not anger but laughter.

"Ha ha ha. Interesting."

The classmates murmured in confusion, unsure if this was a good or bad reaction.

But Lee Rowoon and Han Daye.

They had simply stated their reasons for choosing design and didn't seem to care much about others' reactions.

"These two seem to be the most troublesome in the class of 2011."

There were always the most troublesome students in each class who didn't try to ingratiate themselves with the professor for better grades.

And there were two of them.

"Two troublemakers. This might make teaching more enjoyable."

Those were the kinds of students Professor Jihwasan liked the most.

They were the ones who usually caused significant incidents before or after graduation.

Just as he had once been known as the industry's maverick.

Having identified the potential troublemakers, he introduced himself in his unique way.

"What kind of design have I done? It's faster to show than to tell."

He turned on the presentation screen he had prepared.

Without any explanation, he began to show pictures of the products he had designed one by one.

With each picture of his designs, which students might have seen in commercials, the students couldn't help but exclaim "Wow."

From household appliances seen in commercials to sleek promotional spaces for large companies.

As a renowned designer in the domestic industrial design field, they were impressive works that left the students in awe.

"I've only brought some representative works. What do you think? Do you feel like learning from me?"

"Yes!"

"The most important thing in my class is design with thought. If you prefer thoughtless design, it would be better to leave my class now. I don't intend to go easy on you."

Unlike the loud responses earlier, only the sound of swallowing could be heard in the classroom.

"If you don't think for yourself, you can't distinguish yourself as a designer. And being able to convey your thoughts well is also a virtue of a designer."

He went to the front of the lectern and looked around at the students.

"Find what you think is the best design product. Next week, each of you will take turns presenting it."

The first presentation class.

A class where he could grasp each student's design tendencies and communication skills.

"Think hard until your head hurts. Ha ha."

He laughed heartily, looking at the students' faces filled with deep contemplation.

The troubled expressions pleased him.

Professor Ji believed his job was to make students think and struggle.

So they could grow into thinking designers.

His gaze now turned to the front.

Rowoon was deep in thought.

His eyes seemed more excited than troubled.

'Ha, really an amusing kid. Let's see in the next assignment. Whether you're worth my continued interest or not.'

It was very difficult to please Professor Jihwasan, but once you did, he was known for providing countless opportunities for experience.

Believing that it was best to catch and nurture outstanding talents quickly.

'Let's see.'

A smirk appeared on his face as he looked at Rowoon.
