The Official First Day of School.

Though there was still about a week left before classes began, it was the first day freshmen gathered together.

Entering the designated lecture hall, Lee Rowoon saw several freshmen who seemed new and nervous.

With a hint of tension and awkwardness in the air, Rowoon took a seat.

At that moment, the back of the head of the person in front of him turned around to look at him.

"Hi, I'm Song Jaebeom."

Song Jaebeom, whose cheeks had become chubby from eating a lot after passing, greeted him.

Gone was the rugged face from their earlier hardships, replaced by a still youthful and soft complexion.

‘I heard he lived well before his family went bankrupt, and it doesn't seem like a lie.’

Seeing the neat-looking guy, Rowoon grinned and shook his hand.

"I'm Lee Rowoon. Let's get along well."

College life, which he had always heard about from Jaebeom's stories.

To experience it together felt slightly surreal.

Then Jaebeom suddenly said,

"Actually, I know you."

"Me?"

"You were sitting behind me during the practical exam."

"Oh, I saw you too."

Rowoon was momentarily flustered but responded calmly.

"I was surprised when I saw your drawing at the end. It was so well done."

Jaebeom shook his head as if it was still unbelievable.

"Wow, I wondered if a guy like you would even share a meal with me. It's an honor."

To others, it might seem like a customary greeting, but Rowoon knew Jaebeom was sincere, so he smiled.

‘A guy like you should have truly pursued art.’

Jaebeom often said things like that even before Rowoon's regression.

The courage Jaebeom gave him was eighty percent of the reason Rowoon dared to challenge Yuil Art University.

‘I hope I can be of some help this time.’

Rowoon smiled softly, thinking he could repay the favor.

He also became curious about Jaebeom’s parents, who he was grateful to for letting him work at their print shop after he injured his hand.

However, asking about his parents on the first meeting would be strange, so he decided to do that after they got closer.

As they were laying the foundation for a new friendship, someone sat next to Rowoon.

"Hi."

With a chic voice and a stylish appearance.

It was a female student with a bob haircut that suited her well.

Dressed in sophisticated attire, she was Han Daye, the granddaughter of the Shinhwa Group.

Of course, no one knew that fact.

Seeing Rowoon sitting there, Han Daye initially doubted her eyes.

So, she unconsciously sat next to him.

‘Amazing. You really got into Yuil Art University.’

Han Daye had been preparing according to her father's plan since she was young to get into Yuil Art University.

Yet, Rowoon got into this school in just a year.

‘So, you passed my father's standards too? He must have been quite pleased with such an efficient investment.’

She could vividly imagine her father's satisfied expression, who hated wasting time and money.

‘As I felt during our first meeting, you're a real wild card.’

She propped her chin and stared at Rowoon.

"Why? Is there something on my face?"

Rowoon rubbed both his cheeks.

"No, I'm just glad to be classmates."

Jaebeom, who was excited by her extraordinary beauty, extended his hand to Han Daye for a high-five.

"Yeah! Nice to meet you too."

But Han Daye just smiled faintly without any movement.

Jaebeom quickly retracted his hand and made a fist-pumping gesture by himself.

Soon after, the student council president appeared and briefly explained the design department.

They toured the facilities, played simple games, and after the official schedule ended, the freshmen gathered at a small pub in front of the school, waiting to meet their seniors for the first time.

They looked like typical twenty-year-olds, nervous and excited.

Meanwhile, Rowoon was leisurely observing his classmates.

"Freshmen! Welcome, everyone!"

A loud and familiar voice echoed.

It was Tak Moosuk, whose voice matched his large stature.

Rowoon was delighted to see him again at school.

‘A senior.’

‘What do I do?’

The kids, intimidated by his presence, sat up straight.

Tak Moosuk immediately sat in front of Rowoon.

"I'm glad you became my junior, Rowoon."

"I'm glad too."

Rowoon smiled faintly.

His classmates glanced at them.

‘He seems like a good senior.’

‘Do they know each other?’

‘Nice, he must get a lot of tips.’

Tak Moosuk proudly introduced Rowoon to the other seniors.

"This is my proud junior, Lee Rowoon. He's an amazing guy."

"Wow, he's really the visual of the 11th class.”

Other seniors showed interest in Rowoon, and the seats around him quickly filled up.

As the atmosphere became lively,

"Guys, who is the top student in your class?"

A senior with dark circles asked.

It seemed life as a third-year student was tough.

"Top student?"

"Yeah."

"···I don't know."

A slightly tipsy Jaebeom blinked slowly.

Other kids also shrugged, looking around.

"Not knowing when he's right in front of you."

Tak Moosuk, with a red face, placed his hand on Rowoon's shoulder.

"What?"

"He's right here! The top student of the 11th class!"

Everyone's attention turned to Rowoon due to his loud voice.

"Top student?"

"Who, who?"

"Is it him? Wow, he's got the height, the looks, and a scholarship···."

The drunken kids mumbled loudly.

Rowoon, who was sober, felt a bit embarrassed at this moment.

Han Daye, who had been drinking, suddenly sobered up.

‘Was he the top student?’

She had hoped Rowoon would do well because of his outstanding art skills.

But she never imagined she would be pushed to second place because of him.

He was truly astonishing and surprising.

**

The next day, Rowoon woke up late and drank some cold water.

Although there wasn't much in his house yet, there was a low dining table he picked up from a recycling center in the middle of the room.

Rowoon propped his arms on it and scrolled through his phone.

"Hmm···."

Rowoon was thinking of finding a part-time job.

Rent, living expenses, and future material costs.

He would probably need a part-time job throughout college.

An anonymous sponsor promised to support his living expenses based on his semester results, but that would be for later.

"In the long run, a part-time job at an art academy would be perfect."

It paid well and allowed him to utilize his major.

Plus, it was convenient to balance with school.

"But I need a vacancy."

Most academies had already filled their positions with their former students, making it difficult to find a spot.

Scratching his back, Rowoon turned his gaze to the sunny window.

The sticker from the employment agency was still on the window.

But he liked the sunlight coming into the room, so he smiled naturally.

The shadow formed by the letters of the employment agency made him think of removing the sticker, but he gave up quickly as it was hard to remove unless he hung out of the window.

Before his regression, Rowoon had worked at an employment agency right after leaving the orphanage.

He did various jobs there until he caught the eye of a sculpture company president.

Come to think of it,

"I'm still living at the employment agency right after leaving the orphanage."

He chuckled at the strange connection.

"Might as well study until classes start."

Rowoon decided to go to the school's library after a quick wash.

Beep.

The gate opened when he scanned the student ID he received during orientation.

The art information center, which collected books related to design and art.

He didn't come with any grand ideas in mind.

But as he picked up one book after another that caught his interest, the day quickly turned to night.

The history of when design started in earnest and how it evolved.

The pages turned smoothly, like reading a comic book.

Professor Eun Seongyeon, who was visiting the quiet library before the semester started, couldn't help but take an interest in Rowoon, who was engrossed in books until late.

‘A student I've never seen before, is he from our department?’

It was nice to see someone so dedicated even during vacation.

**

The day of the opening ceremony arrived.

With a slightly excited heart, Rowoon entered the computer lab early.

Today's first class was 'Introduction to Graphic Design.'

A class to learn the basics of 2D tools and build a foundation in visual design.

"Hi."

The next person to arrive early was Han Daye.

Given her early arrival, she seemed like a model student, but she had actually just enjoyed a rare moment of freedom the previous night.

Meeting friends she hadn't seen in a while, strolling through the night streets, and drinking.

‘Daye, how come you're still here at this hour?’

‘Do you know what I got from my dad as a condition for getting into Yuil Art University? Freedom!’

‘Wow, Daye, are you living alone? You made it!’

She vividly remembered her friends' astonished faces last night.

This was the only time Han Daye could enjoy freedom.

After graduation, she would have to live according to her father's suffocating plans.

Maintaining top grades was a condition, but she thought she could manage that.

Somehow, the kids she hung out with on orientation day naturally gathered together.

So, Song Jaebeom, Lee Rowoon, and Han Daye.

The three, not yet close, sat in a row, creating an odd atmosphere.

"Hello, everyone."

A calm-looking female professor with short hair entered the computer lab.

"You know that your courses are broadly divided into product and visual design, right? Until the second year, you'll study both majors together, and in the third year, you'll choose a major for in-depth study."

Her voice was as calm as her appearance.

"I'm Eun Seongyeon, teaching visual design."

Professor Eun looked around at the undergraduates in the computer lab.

They were her students and the future of the design world.

And then,

‘That student.’

Professor Eun's gaze stopped at Rowoon.

The student who had been buried in books in the art information center until late recently.

She hadn’t expected him to be a freshman.

‘A freshman burning with such academic passion. Interesting.’

A faint smile appeared on her lips.

Professor Eun liked students with a research-oriented attitude.

Before starting the class, Professor Eun asked a general question to everyone.

"What do you think the 'Introduction to Graphic Design' class is about?"

"It's a class to learn how to use 2D graphic tools and apply them to visual design."

Someone answered confidently, and Professor Eun smiled gracefully.

"Then why do you think designers need to learn tools?"

"Because it's fundamental for designers."

Professor Eun paused for a moment and then walked elegantly.

"Why is that fundamental? Because everyone does it?"

At that moment, someone remembered hearing from a senior during orientation that Professor Eun’s nickname was the “Question Mark Killer.”

So, the student who answered earlier looked unsure.

"In that case, let's think about it. If a designer can't use tools, are they not a designer?"

When the earlier student didn't answer, Professor Eun looked around at all the students.

She wanted them to understand the essence of learning tools.

Sometimes designers said things like this:

‘I feel comfortable just handling tools.’ or ‘I just want to plan.’

Of course, that was possible in the field.

Specializing in what one was good at was efficient.

But Professor Eun wanted her students to be versatile.

Even if they were good at planning or skilled in techniques,

She thought they were only half a designer.

To achieve that, they needed to understand the essence themselves.

But,

‘Was my expectation too high on the first day?’

No matter how much she looked around, all the students were silent, which was disappointing.

She thought there would be at least one student who could answer.

Han Daye considered speaking up but decided against it since answering well here wouldn't help her grades.

Just then,

Behind Han Daye’s black hair, a hand went up.

"The student with the raised hand."

A smile reappeared on Professor Eun's face.

It was the student who had been studying diligently in the library every day.

The one who had been actively showing initiative even before the semester started.

‘If it's this student, they might know the answer.’

"What’s your name?"

"I'm Lee Rowoon."

At the same time, the students turned their heads towards Rowoon, and a subtle sense of anticipation arose in Professor Eun’s heart.
