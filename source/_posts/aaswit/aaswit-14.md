Rowoon came out of school with Tak Moosuk.

They were on their way to the president interview for the Charm Art Volunteer Club.

"Don't worry, it's just a formal procedure. I've already talked to them."

"Yes, I understand."

"The president likes things to be certain."

Rowoon was curious about what kind of person the president would be if Tak Moosuk, who seemed so reliable, was the vice president.

"Is the president from Seohan University?"

"Yes."

A smart and model student image formed in his mind.

While chatting, they soon arrived near Seohan University.

However, Tak Moosuk kept passing by the big cafes and walked into a secluded alley.

'We might end up near my house at this rate.'

His words came true as they entered an old shop he had seen near his house.

Despite the old-looking exterior, the inside was cozy and clean.

'A pasta place...?'

They were selling pasta in such a quiet place, making him wonder if the business would do well.

They greeted the friendly owner and found a suitable seat.

"They haven't arrived yet, it seems."

"Are we having a meal?"

"No, you can just order coffee here."

They ordered three cups of coffee in advance and waited for the president.

-Vrrrr. Squeak.

They heard a sound from outside, like a motorcycle parking.

Soon, the bell rang as the door opened, and someone in a rider jacket and helmet entered the shop.

The person looked around as if searching for someone and soon found Tak Moosuk, raising a hand.

'Is it that person?'

The person walked briskly and took off the helmet right in front of Rowoon's nose.

Long, flowing hair spilled out.

'...!'

Before Rowoon could even register the unexpected gender, he was stunned.

Her white skin seemed to light up like a spotlight.

Her elegant yet glamorous features looked like an ink painting.

The name of this woman, who created a scene straight out of a commercial, was.

"I'm Baek Iryeong."

She was currently a magazine model and the president of the Charm Art Volunteer Club.

And she was the actress he'd seen countless times in TV commercials before his regression.

**

'So this club has a celebrity, and they were talking about her.'

He finally understood why they chose such a secluded place and why people were lining up to join the club.

She might not be famous yet, but she recently graced the cover of 'Campus Today.'

Her pale skin made her look even colder as she sipped her iced coffee and examined Rowoon with her big eyes.

"Since you're an art student at Yu-il University, you must be good at drawing. Why do you want to volunteer?"

"Can I be honest?"

"Yes, the more honest, the better."

She spoke calmly and took her lips off the iced coffee.

Until a moment ago, Rowoon thought it didn't matter if he passed or not.

But now, his thoughts changed.

Baek Iryeong was a future CF star.

Moreover, she was known for her keen interest in art.

[Baek Iryeong, the Dream of the CF Queen.]

- Known as an art enthusiast in the entertainment world, she is famous for frequently attending various exhibitions. She collects everything from paintings and sculptures to designer products, and dreams of becoming a curator in her own small gallery someday...

Rowoon recalled an article he had seen before.

He also seemed to remember an article about unknown artists or designers benefiting from her fame.

'Knowing her will surely help.'

In the past, he had no interest in connections, but the world was a tough place to live alone.

He had learned that having someone's help made things much easier.

With that experience in mind, Rowoon spoke his thoughts.

"I want to repay the help I've received so far. And I thought my drawing skills could be of help."

Baek Iryeong mulled over Rowoon's answer while stirring her iced coffee with a straw.

The sound of the ice clinking was refreshing.

"So, you're not here because Tak Moosuk forced you."

At that moment, Tak Moosuk's aggrieved voice came from the side.

"I've never forcibly brought anyone."

"I'm joking."

Baek Iryeong showed a faint smile.

She immediately handed over some documents she had brought.

It was a summary of the main activities of the Charm club, along with the website address.

"Announcements will be posted in the chat room and on our website. You can participate in any activities that interest you."

"Am I accepted?"

"Why?"

"I heard it's hard to join this club."

Baek Iryeong chuckled.

"Was it too easy for you? Actually, Tak Moosuk already told me a lot about you."

Tak Moosuk then wore a proud expression.

"And seeing you in person, I also got interested."

"Interested?"

"Yes."

She didn't elaborate and took another sip of her iced coffee.

'The desire to repay help is refreshing.'

That's why she was looking forward to seeing how he would participate in club activities.

More importantly, the club needed skilled artists, and Rowoon seemed straightforward and honest.

"Please be active in the club. If you don't participate enough, we might have to expel you for club management reasons."

"Yes, I will."

"I'm looking forward to seeing how good your drawing skills are."

Professor Ji Hwasan's lab.

Two graduate students were typing on their keyboards.

"Not a senior, not a junior... A freshman undergrad. Did I hear that right?"

"Oh, that."

They were writing a report for a mid-sized electronics company, providing design consultation.

Under Professor Ji Hwasan's lead, the consultation was to be actively reflected in the new product lineup, making it a significant project for them.

Professor Ji, though meticulous, took good care of his people and promised to include their names in the report.

It would be a line on their resume, and they never knew how things might connect in the future.

"I heard correctly. A freshman undergrad."

"How can he include a freshman in this project? He can't be serious, right?"

Still in disbelief, he took his eyes off the monitor.

"What useful opinion can a freshman give? He must be included just for experience. But whoever he is, Ji must really like him."

"Sigh, if an undergrad who knows nothing gives unnecessary opinions, it will be a hassle. I don't know about anything else, but I just hope we finish quickly so I can go home."

As they stretched for a moment, Professor Ji Hwasan returned to the lab.

"Where do you think you're going?"

"Oh, just to the restroom for a moment."

"Alright, be quick."

The graduate student slyly got up and left the lab.

At that moment, Assistant Park poked his head in.

"Professor, I brought what you asked for."

"Oh, thanks."

The note he handed over had someone's phone number written on it.

Professor Ji chuckled and took out his phone.

'This guy won't say no, right?'

He immediately pressed the call button.

Then the 'trrrrng' of the ringing tone started from the other side of the phone.

**

"Not going anywhere today?"

Song Jaebum asked Daye, who was unusually having a meal with him.

"I'm going to do some assignments today."

"What's the occasion? You always think about finishing quickly and going out of school."

Daye glanced at Rowoon while chewing her food.

Throughout her time in elementary, middle, and high school.

She had rarely failed her father's expectations.

Just doing enough to pass that standard, adding a little more.

Her exceptional intelligence allowed her to maintain her father's expectations until now.

But her first failure recently.

Entering this school as the second, not the top student.

Moreover, if she missed the first place this semester, her father would not let it slide.

'But I can't figure this guy out.'

Rowoon was a different kind of person compared to anyone she had seen so far.

That intrigued her and made her interested.

Worried about her ranking, yet curious about what Rowoon would show next, she found it ironic.

Bzzzz.

While they were eating, Rowoon's phone rang from an unknown number.

"Hello?"

-Is this Lee Rowoon's phone?

"Yes, it is."

A middle-aged man's voice that seemed familiar.

He confirmed it was Rowoon and then spoke more comfortably.

-Oh, it's Ji Hwasan. Can you come to my lab?

Seeing Rowoon's puzzled expression, Song Jaebum asked while munching on his side dish.

"Why, who is it?"

**

"Oh, you're here. Have a seat."

Professor Ji Hwasan's lab.

Ji Hwasan greeted Rowoon warmly.

Two graduate students were sitting on the sofa in the middle of the lab.

They seemed friendly but vaguely uninterested in Rowoon.

They looked busy, as if this was an annoying task.

Their dark circles under their eyes made it somewhat understandable.

As soon as Rowoon sat down, Ji Hwasan got straight to the point.

"I'm currently working on a project commissioned by a mid-sized company."

He pointed to the report on the table.

"This company is seeking our advice on their new products, from a universal design perspective."

The logo on the paper indicated a well-known small appliance company.

"Do you know what universal design is?"

Professor Ji asked, just in case.

It was natural for a newly admitted freshman not to know, but he wanted to be sure.

However, Rowoon answered without hesitation.

"I understand it as a design that everyone can use easily, regardless of age, gender, race, or disability."

He recalled his prior studies in the library.

As expected.

Professor Ji Hwasan showed a satisfied smile.

'As expected, he's exceptional.'

Rowoon's eyes were full of curiosity and desire, which were not for nothing.

"That's right. It's also called inclusive design."

A design that everyone can use without discrimination.

For example, ambidextrous scissors or ramps designed for wheelchairs.

Ji Hwasan glanced at the graduate students, as if to say, 'See that?'

But the graduate students seemed puzzled.

They still couldn't understand why he liked this student so much.

"Anyway, we've come to some conclusions, but we're stuck here all the time, so it's hard to see more."

He rubbed one knee.

"What do you think? Can you give me your opinion?"

"My opinion?"

"Yes, anything will do. I'll filter it out anyway."

Rowoon felt a slight stir inside.

The sketches completed by the professor and the graduate students.

Asking a newly admitted freshman for his opinion on them.

If Rowoon were an ordinary freshman, he might have just waved it off here.

But.

'This seems like an opportunity given to me.'

He guessed so, looking at Ji Hwasan's eyes filled with interest.

And if an opportunity arose.

'I should seize it.'

That was a lesson learned from his past life.

Rowoon carefully examined the drawings spread on the table.

Concept sketches of small appliances like rice cookers, blenders, and vacuum cleaners were scattered everywhere.

The clean sketches exuded a professional's craftsmanship.

Their usability was intuitively felt.

And the sophisticated forms added to it were.

'Just like I saw in the future.'

It seemed like the designs would almost be adopted as they were.

"They're really cool. They would look even better when made."

These appliances were loved for their sleek designs in the future.

The graduate students looked relieved, glad that no troublesome work had come up, and Professor Ji rubbed his knee impatiently.

"Good? That's it?"

His face showed unmistakable disappointment.

Rowoon's unique perspective had already been validated in previous classes.

So he expected something novel, even if a bit odd.

'Is this topic too difficult for him?'

Ji Hwasan rubbed his prickly chin.

After all, he was just a freshman who had barely started school.

Maybe his expectations were a bit too high.

'It's awkward to include him in the project at this point.'

As he regretfully smacked his lips, Rowoon, still closely examining the sketches, spoke up.

"I do have one idea. Can I show it with a sketch instead of words?"

Ji Hwasan's face finally showed a hint of interest.

"Sure, go ahead."

"Thank you."

A graduate student handed over an empty notebook and a mechanical pencil, his face filled with concern.

'This will waste time.'

He was anxious about spending time looking at a freshman's drawing.

He needed to review the report one more time to ensure no mistakes, with the deadline approaching fast.

Rowoon gripped the sharp pencil deftly.

He had already visualized the supplementary images in his mind while looking at the graduate students' sketches.

Without damaging their concept.

Sketches that could address the issues.

Rowoon's interest in universal design in the library had its reasons.

'Because I once had a disability in my right hand.'

So it was crystal clear to him.

What problems the sketches before him had.

He didn't hesitate.

If this opinion could be reflected, and if it could help left-handers like his past self, even a little.

Click.

The sound of the mechanical pencil's button seemed like a solemn starting signal.

Soon, the sharp lines started racing across the notebook.

"...."

The three people watched intently, almost like spectators before a game.
