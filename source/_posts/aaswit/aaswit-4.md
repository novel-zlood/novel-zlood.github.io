The director of Hope Orphanage, Director Shim, suddenly had a bewildered expression, and instead, the people around him made a fuss.

"Oh my, oh my. What's going on?"

"Congratulations, Director Shim!"

"They're offering to teach for free!"

Rowoon's sudden declaration to go to art school,

Winning a gold medal in a competition he suddenly participated in,

And the unprecedented offer of free tuition,

Were all completely unexpected.

Director Shim cautiously spoke up.

"We are very grateful, but is it really okay to offer it for free?"

"Yes. There's no need to worry. I want to invest in Rowoon's future."

Director Bae of the art academy thought that Rowoon should continue drawing regardless of his environment, and with his level of skill, he could be responsible for his college admission.

Moreover, if Rowoon goes to a good college, it would greatly help promote the academy.

For an academy in the countryside like this, sending just one student to a good college would allow them to proudly stand tall at the main branch.

"The better the college Rowoon goes to, the more we benefit. Hahaha."

Director Bae laughed heartily.

Thanks to that, the previously subdued atmosphere brightened instantly.

"Congratulations, Director!"

"It's such a relief; it must feel great."

"Sending a student to an art academy, I'm so envious."

Receiving congratulations from all sides made the recent events feel more real.

The immediate, overwhelming worries seemed to vanish.

Just as a gentle smile spread across her face, someone spoke loudly enough for the plump director to hear.

"See, we weren't just blowing smoke, were we? If an expert says so, right?"

"That's right, that's right."

"That's why we shouldn't judge children's potential too hastily, especially us orphanage directors."

Naturally, everyone's attention turned to the plump director, who cleared his throat awkwardly.

Seizing the moment when the reactions relaxed, he spoke to Director Bae of the art academy.

"Uhm... our child also won a silver medal, Director."

"Oh, congratulations."

"Could our child also... possibly get free lessons?"

His earlier displeased attitude was now replaced with a rather pathetic appearance.

In contrast, Director Bae drew a clear line.

"I'm sorry, but it's not because Rowoon won the gold medal that I offered free lessons. It's because of Rowoon's remarkable potential!"

He took a small piece of paper from his wallet.

"I'm giving you my business card, so you can come for a consultation anytime."

His business acumen shone even in that situation.

The plump director wiped his sweat repeatedly and soon left, followed by the others.

Left alone again, Director Shim of Hope Orphanage watched the children from a distance, smiling.

"Rowoon, it seems you really might become something."

From the moment Rowoon declared he wanted to go to art school, while wanting to support the child's dream, the word 'impossible' had continued to trouble Director Shim's mind.

Today's participation in the event was to accurately gauge reality.

In the end, Rowoon showed astonishing potential, and now the word 'possible' began to miraculously edge its way in.

As she was reflecting on this magical day, a man in a black suit and sunglasses approached her.

"Are you the director of Hope Orphanage?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Just by seeing the man's attire, which didn't suit the event,

She had an even more ominous premonition this time.

**

The children of Hope Orphanage were each enjoying the event.

Rowoon was strolling around the square, followed closely by Jihan, who asked,

"Rowoon hyung, aren't you going over there?"

"Is there somewhere you want to go?"

Jihan, who could have just followed the other hyungs, was insistently following Rowoon.

But since Rowoon showed no signs of heading towards the event booths, Jihan seemed to be getting impatient.

"Let's go where you want to go."

Following Jihan's lead, they visited various event booths.

Then,

"...?"

Rowoon unexpectedly spotted a familiar face.

A young man with a sturdy back and bulging muscles.

A man with thick eyebrows that were hard to forget once seen.

Thanks to his distinctive, rugged silhouette, Rowoon immediately remembered the man.

'That guy is definitely from Yuil Art University.'

Song Jaebum, Rowoon's oldest friend, was from Yuil Art University.

While working at a major event with Song Jaebum, Rowoon had coincidentally run into the man and found out he was Jaebum's senior from school.

Meeting him again at an event in such a rural area felt like a miracle.

Seeing him wearing a matching fluorescent vest with other young men, it seemed he was participating as part of a volunteer club.

So Rowoon headed straight to the face painting booth where the man was.

Jihan, who had followed Rowoon without knowing, had his eyes shining brightly.

It seemed the face painting booth was just his style.

"Please draw a cool Greatman for me!"

Rowoon sat in front of the young man and asked for a suitable design to be drawn on his hand.

"I like this balloon design."

"Excellent choice."

The man answered in his characteristic hearty tone.

Though his appearance seemed a bit rough for this kind of work, he seemed to be a good person.

Sasa-sak.

The man picked up a fine brush with his large hand.

And he carefully began to apply non-toxic paint on Rowoon's hand.

At a glance, it looked like the brush might break at any moment, but his skilled brushwork gently formed the shape of a balloon.

He maintained a consistent thickness for the black outline, using thinner lines for detailed expressions.

He utilized the brush's elasticity appropriately, ensuring no lines went out of place.

He was displaying remarkable concentration for such a small drawing.

As his meticulous drawing started to take shape,

Rowoon seized the opportunity to speak.

"Hyung, I have a question."

"Ask anything."

"Are you an art student?"

Asking if he was an art student since he drew well.

Despite the somewhat simple question, the young man looked up and grinned.

"Yes, I am an art student."

It was rare for a high school student to enter this booth.

Most of the visitors were elementary school students.

Tak Mooseok, the young man, could tell that Rowoon had come here out of interest in drawing.

Children from orphanages are usually withdrawn and try to hide their emotions.

This was something he had felt repeatedly through his volunteer work.

Rowoon, who didn't hide his interest and came straight to him, was quite intriguing.

At that moment, a female college student who was drawing on Jihan's face suddenly joined in.

"Though he might not look it, he's from Yuil Art University."

"Yuil Art University?"

Rowoon pretended not to know.

"He's also from a family of master craftsmen in furniture making for three generations. Hard to believe, right?"

Bored with just sitting still, Jihan also stared at Tak Mooseok and asked.

"But why aren't you at school and here instead?"

"I'm on a break to fulfill my military duty. My grandparents live here."

Tak Mooseok, who had a short haircut, brushed his hair back and stared at Rowoon.

"I saw your drawing earlier."

"Oh, yes."

"You won the gold medal."

Tak Mooseok looked at Rowoon with an admiring expression.

Then, he suddenly extended his thick hand.

"Make sure you come to our school."

Rowoon, having no reason to refuse, shook Tak Mooseok's hand.

"My goal is also Yuil Art University. If you have time, I'd like to get some advice."

"Of course!"

Seeming quite pleased with the situation,

Tak Mooseok replied cheerfully.

**

For the first time, he entered an art academy.

"Welcome, Rowoon."

The man who looked like a chubby David statue greeted Rowoon warmly.

He was none other than Director Bae, who recognized Rowoon's potential.

"Classes are divided by grade, so you can go in here. We'll start with the basics as you wanted, but you'll probably finish quickly."

"Thank you."

Opening the glass door, he found a spacious classroom filled with desks, and the walls were covered with drawings suitable for entrance exams.

'So this is what an art academy feels like.'

The smell of dry wood lingered, and there were smudges of handprints on the walls, floor, and glass doors.

It was before class started, so the students were huddled together.

From them, he could feel the sharp tension unique to high school seniors.

They were all comrades going through this period together, yet also competitors.

So it was only natural that the new student drew their attention.

As the students' gazes shifted back and forth, Director Bae led Rowoon to the head instructor.

"Teacher Ju, this is the student I mentioned."

"Oh, you're that kid?"

"I'm Lee Rowoon."

"You're quite handsome!"

As the head instructor warmly welcomed Rowoon, the students showed signs of wariness.

'Is he from another academy?'

'Or the director's nephew?'

While everyone was busy trying to gauge whether the newcomer was above or below their skill level,

"Take a seat here and take out your pencil and eraser first."

Seeing Rowoon open his basic notebook, the students all sighed in relief.

But whether they did or not,

Rowoon was overwhelmed with excitement at finally being able to study art.

In the past, it was a repressed desire, but in reality, he had desperately wanted to learn art.

He had heard it so many times that his ears were calloused.

'Because I couldn't learn', 'Because I had no foundation'.

From now on, those words meant nothing to Rowoon.

Starting today, many things would change.

He had a burning desire to learn everything about art as quickly as possible.

As he was eagerly awaiting his first-ever class,

"Lee Rowoon, are you doing art now?"

Someone greeted Rowoon.

Turning around, he saw a boy who had been in the same class as him in the second year of high school.

The boy looked Rowoon up and down with a puzzled expression.

"Isn't it a bit late to start art now?"

Park Changhoon wasn't a bad kid but had a bit of a show-off personality.

Having no interest in academics from the start, he had turned to arts and sports early on.

Rowoon casually answered his question.

"But I'm still going to try."

"That's the right attitude. If you have any questions, ask this hyung."

It seemed like Park Changhoon had a significant presence, being a long-time attendee of the academy, as the other kids also noted him.

Satisfied with showing off his status to the new student, Park Changhoon turned around.

But it took only a few weeks for the situation to reverse.

"Depending on where you look, the shape of the object changes..."

Various ways to use lines,

Perspective, vanishing points, and other concepts to express the third dimension more realistically.

Learning the principles for concepts he had previously understood by intuition made his mind feel clearer.

Like rebuilding a Jenga tower that had been stacked randomly.

So he felt he could stack it even higher.

'So this is what it's like.'

As hungry as he had been for art,

Rowoon absorbed everything like a starving man.

Once he quickly mastered the basics,

"What? Is he really a beginner?"

Understanding the basics allowed his drawing skills to improve rapidly.

As a result, the ecosystem of the academy began to collapse quickly.

"How did he get an A on the first combined exam?"

The kids soon lost their fighting spirit to compete out of jealousy.

Around late October, just before the college entrance exam,

"Rowoon, what's wrong with this part?"

"How about changing the composition like this? It will cover the difficult part."

Seeing Rowoon draw quickly to demonstrate, Park Changhoon slapped his forehead with a loud sound.

"Wow, you're a genius, aren't you?"

Both in drawing skills and ideas,

Rowoon had become an untouchable presence.

"Lee Rowoon, teach me this too."

"Me too!"

He had risen to the top of the academy's ecosystem purely through skill.

One day, right before the college entrance exam,

Park Changhoon asked Rowoon,

"Rowoon, which school are you applying to?"

The noisy kids perked up their ears.

"My goal is Yuil Art University."

"...."

Rowoon's answer brought complete silence.

There was no doubt that Rowoon was going to the best university from this academy.

But no matter how good he was, this was a branch in the countryside.

At best, students from this academy went to universities in Seoul.

So Yuil Art University was almost like a fantasy.

It was on the level of Hogwarts from a fantasy novel.

'Yuil Art University? Don't you need to use magic to get in?'

'Wouldn't you have to get struck by lightning?'

Kids, thinking it was unrealistic, made absurd jokes, and Park Changhoon muttered nonsensically.

"Hey, you probably need almost god-level grades to get in there."

**

The day of the college entrance exam, with its biting cold, arrived.

All high school seniors are desperate, but

who could be more so than someone who had once ruined their life?

Rowoon, feeling exhausted after using his brain to its full capacity, walked out of the school gates.

Living a life with a goal and passion.

Rowoon felt alive because of it.

"Life is quite fun this time."

That evening,

Director Shim of the orphanage called Rowoon.

"How was it? Do you think you did well?"

"Yes. I think I did as much as I studied."

Rowoon had studied to the point of concern.

Without sleeping.

Reducing his eating time.

Director Shim had thought Rowoon might regret such a short period of intense effort, but

instead, Rowoon's relaxed expression made her laugh.

"So there's no problem preparing for Yuil Art University?"

Director Shim, trying to hide her tension, watched Rowoon's expression.

Rowoon, smiling softly, replied.

"Yes. I just need to focus on the practical skills now."

Only then did Director Shim's face show a hint of relief.

Since the art academy didn't have an instructor from Yuil Art University,

Rowoon had been getting help from Tak Mooseok, whom he met at the orphanage event.

He had received evaluations on his drawings and advice on his grades.

According to the Yuil Art University student,

[With these grades, you have enough to become my junior.]

There was no need to worry about the preliminary test results.

"Good job. Rest well today."

"From tomorrow, I have winter special classes. I'll be at the academy from the morning."

"Oh dear, you won't even have time to rest properly. Okay, I understand."

Tak.

The sound of the door closing brought silence to the director's office.

Director Shim, proud of Rowoon for creating his own future and achieving what seemed impossible, smiled.

"Things that seemed impossible are gradually becoming reality."

Director Shim took off her reading glasses and rubbed her eyes.

Like her refreshed yet dry eyes, the end of her smile felt heavy.

Because there was an issue she had to resolve as Rowoon's guardian from now on.

"To support his college tuition even a little... Let's see."

When leaving the orphanage, a settlement support fund of 5 million won is given.

But it was far from enough for Rowoon, who had to prepare for living in Seoul.

Housing costs, living expenses, and tuition fees.

Although Rowoon wouldn't have aimed for Yuil Art University without considering this,

the weight of the reality she feared felt like it was pressing down on her shoulders.

Even if her duty ended when he left the orphanage,

"Still, I'll do what I can."

She adjusted her reading glasses and was about to look at the list of various support foundations.

Ziiiing-

The phone on the table vibrated strongly.

It was an unknown number, but she answered the call.

And a few seconds later.

-This is Manager Kim Jinmyung, who asked for your contact information at the last orphanage event.

She heard the voice of the man in the suit from the event.

So Director Shim quickly took out the business card she had received from her wallet.

"Oh, yes. Yes."

It was a strange business card with only a name and phone number.

But then,

-We would like to sponsor Rowoon.

"Excuse me?"

It was an unbelievable offer.
