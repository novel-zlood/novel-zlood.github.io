After Professor Ji Hwasan's class ended,

As Professor Ji Hwasan's back disappeared into the distance, Song Jaebeom quickly whispered,

"Did you guys notice anything strange during the class?"

"What do you mean?"

"Professor Ji Hwasan's eyes when he looks at you guys are weird. Especially when he looks at you, Rowoon."

"Me?"

"Yeah! He keeps smirking."

Song Jaebeom imitated Professor Ji Hwasan's creepy smile, saying it gave him the chills.

"Like this, lifting one corner of his mouth. What do you think it means?"

He tilted his head in confusion.

It was the first class, so there shouldn't be any personal connections with specific students.

However, Han Daye seemed to understand a bit and said,

"Maybe he likes you."

"Who expresses their liking like that in this world?"

Song Jaebeom was startled, while Han Daye nonchalantly packed her bag.

She always has a strict schedule for attending and leaving school.

Han Daye was more sincere than anyone in enjoying her freedom.

She was glad that she no longer had to be followed by a secretary or report her schedule to her father.

Curious about what Han Daye was up to today, Song Jaebeom asked,

"What's your schedule for today?"

"First, I'll do my assignment, then I'm going to watch a play at Daehangno. After the play, I'm going to a nice bar with friends."

"Wow, you're diligent."

But that didn't mean Han Daye was neglecting her assignments.

She had to maintain top grades to continue her free lifestyle.

She was always striving to meet her father's expectations.

On the other hand, Song Jaebeom was originally a relaxed person.

He found Han Daye, who meticulously managed her time, fascinating.

This time, he asked Rowoon,

"What about you? What are you doing after class?"

"I'm going to the computer lab to research product design."

"Already? You still have a week left to do the assignment."

"I have to do it in advance. That way, I can find something more satisfying."

"Ah, as expected of the top student."

Song Jaebeom shook his head in admiration.

"And I need to start looking for a part-time job."

Now that he knew how his week would go, Rowoon thought of finding a part-time job that fit his schedule.

As for Song Jaebeom, he was helping out at his parents' print shop as a part-time job.

Rowoon's gaze rested on Han Daye.

"Don't you have a part-time job?"

"I..."

She was usually outspoken about her thoughts.

But this time, she hesitated to answer.

The reason she didn't have a part-time job was simple.

She didn't lack money.

And she never wanted to reveal her title as the granddaughter of the Shinhwa Group.

Han Daye gave a faint smile and avoided answering.

"Work hard on your assignment."

**

In the evening, walking down the alley towards home.

The dull sound of footsteps echoed against the old buildings.

Streetlights came on, and the signs of stores began to light up one by one.

Rowoon had been researching products at school that he liked, but he hadn't found anything that struck him, leaving him feeling unsatisfied.

"The best designs, the top designs..."

Rowoon murmured to himself in frustration.

The Proust chair with colorful patterns on a Baroque-style chair.

The Able Phone, praised as the greatest innovation in 21st-century mobile phones.

And various sleek and practical products.

The impressive designs he saw at the art information center earlier floated in his mind.

What can be considered the best design?

Even among renowned designers of the past, opinions varied on this matter.

The master of modern architecture in the 20th century, Mies van der Rohe, said "less is more," meaning the less decoration, the better. Meanwhile, postmodern architect Robert Venturi said "less is a bore."

And some said "more is more."

Of course, there were social and cultural backgrounds at the time, but the fact remained that each designer had different priorities.

So,

"The important thing in this class is what I prioritize in design right now."

What each person considers most important in design.

Why they want to design.

It was related to the question Professor Ji Hwasan asked as soon as he entered the class.

The assignment was to find a product that struck them and think about why.

'What kind of design do I want to do?'

Fulfilling artistic needs and making money.

Putting all that aside, what kind of design do I want to do in the future?

Rowoon thought deeply and came to a conclusion.

'I don't know about grand things yet, but I just want to make something that as many people as possible can use.'

It would be even better if it had a plausible reason for others.

This was his most honest answer at the moment.

The idea of someone using something he designed.

Just imagining it made his heart flutter.

And if more people used his design?

Rowoon thought he might be a little happier, not just because he would earn more money.

As he approached his home and lifted his head, the street suddenly felt unfamiliar.

It was a neighborhood he discovered while looking for good and affordable materials before his regression.

In his faint memories, he couldn't recall anything about the area where he lived.

"Come to think of it, I have no memory of this building."

There were places that remained the same, like corners of other alleys or shops, but this particular area was not in his memory.

'Is it going to be redeveloped? I hope not before I graduate.'

The lights of the stores around his home flickered faintly.

‘I wonder if business is good...’

With such thoughts, he entered the building.

Creak.

As he opened the old iron door, the room was reflected by the orange streetlight.

Rowoon was glad that he could find such a place for this amount of money.

Although there was no one to greet him, at least it didn't feel like entering a basement.

When he turned on the light, the empty room became more visible.

A small dining table he picked up from outside.

A second-hand refrigerator.

And a thin blanket spread on the floor.

"I need to find a part-time job quickly and start filling this place up."

Rowoon put his bag on the floor and leaned against the wall.

He immediately took out his phone and started searching for part-time jobs.

"There's nowhere to find part-time work around here."

It seemed he had to go further to the bustling area.

He checked some decent job postings and also posted his profile on tutoring sites.

Growl.

The moment he pressed the last upload button, his stomach rumbled like thunder.

"Come to think of it, I haven't had dinner."

He thought of going to the mart and was about to get up.

Thud thud.

There was a banging sound at the front door.

"...?"

At first, he thought he misheard.

Thud thud thud!

But soon, a louder banging sound resonated through the room.

"Who could it be? I have no visitors."

He opened the door cautiously, thinking it might be a drunk who lost their way, and saw an older woman standing in the hallway.

She had a child, about three or four years old, on her back.

As soon as she saw Rowoon, she asked in a flustered tone,

"Is Mr. Kim here?"

"Sorry?"

"Mr. Kim from the labor office."

On closer inspection, she was the owner of a nearby mart.

She peeked through the gap in the open door and exclaimed in surprise.

"Did Mr. Kim move out? When did he leave? Without saying anything."

"I moved in about two weeks ago, so he must have left before that."

"I'm sorry. The sign and window writing outside are still the same, so I didn't know."

The lady looked apologetic.

Rowoon nodded to indicate it was okay and was about to close the door.

"Excuse me."

The lady's urgent voice stopped him.

"I need to put up a shelf in the store, but it's hard for me to do it alone. Could you help me? I'll compensate you."

Rowoon hesitated but then nodded.

After all, he was planning to go to the mart.

**

Brrr.

The sound of the drill motor echoed cheerfully in the supermarket.

"You're an art student at Yuil Art University? Wow, you're from a prestigious school."

"Fortunately, the wall isn't concrete."

Rowoon knocked on the wooden wall with his fist.

For Rowoon, who had made sculptures before his regression, this was a piece of cake.

Vrrr!

The drill smoothly pierced through the wall, and he felt a bit of stress relief.

"Maybe it's because you're an art student, but the shelf positioning is artistic. The levels seem just perfect."

The lady murmured in admiration, "Maybe it's because he's an art student."

After checking that the last shelf was securely in place, Rowoon took off his work gloves.

"They're firmly installed."

"Thank you so much, student. My husband is never around when I need him. He's gone off somewhere far. The storage is limited, so I can't just leave things piled up."

Three wooden shelves were installed on the empty wall to the right of the counter.

She planned to put small items on them for sale.

"Thank you, here's your payment. And since you live alone, you must need a lot of things."

The lady handed Rowoon a crumpled envelope with a genuinely grateful expression.

She also added some ramen and dairy products.

Rowoon was slightly surprised when he checked the money.

"You gave me quite a lot."

"It's not much! You installed three shelves. Come to our store often. I'll give you discounts."

"Thank you."

"By the way, have you eaten?"

The lady mimicked eating with a spoon.

Normally, he would have declined out of modesty.

Growl.

But thanks to his rumbling stomach breaking the silence, he ended up in the lady's home on the second floor.

The dining table was set with soybean paste stew, pumpkin pancakes, and rolled omelets, all radiating warmth.

Though the well-prepared home-cooked meal felt unfamiliar, Rowoon picked up the spoon and took a sip of the stew.

The moderately savory aroma rose as the soft tofu crumbled in his mouth.

"Is it good?"

"It's really delicious."

A smile naturally formed on Rowoon's face.

The four-year-old sitting in front of him was the lady's youngest child.

"Does the baby eat well?"

"Yes, he can't get enough. Here, hold this."

The lady placed a spoon in the child's hand.

The child grabbed the handle like a fist and pushed the food into his small mouth.

"He eats really well."

Watching the little one diligently using a spoon made Rowoon smile.

'Come to think of it, is the spoon the first tool we learn to use?'

An essential tool for putting food into our mouths, related to our instinct to eat, and used by everyone, regardless of age or gender.

As he was having such trivial thoughts and was about to take another spoonful of rice,

Clang.

The sound of the spoon hitting the bowl was accompanied by a flash in his mind.

'What kind of design do I want to do?'

The answer dawned on him.

Rowoon realized he had been looking too far for good designs.

'This is it.'

An intuitive form that anyone can use easily.

Rationality that allows people from various generations to use it.

Right in front of him was the best design Rowoon had been thinking of.

**

"Alright, I hope everyone has prepared well for their presentations."

A week passed quickly, and it was time for the "Concept Sculpture" class.

Students were a bit taken aback as Professor Ji entered the lecture hall earlier than usual.

They nervously put down their practice materials and tensed up.

"Let's see what great products you've found."

Professor Ji Hwasan scanned the students with hawk-like eyes.

The students bit their dry lips, feeling like prey in front of a hawk.

They wanted to avoid being the first to present at all costs.

"Then, let's start from that side and go one by one."

He deliberately pointed to a student sitting farthest from Rowoon.

Saving the most anticipated for last was the best part.
