After all the classes ended for the day.

"Finally, the time has come."

Song Jaebeom said confidently.

"What time?"

"The time to use the expensive printing equipment at our shop. We've always been busy printing things for others."

He then let out a sigh, "Hoo."

"Even Professor Eun Seongyeon's class, which I trusted, has started serious assignments. Now, there's no escaping assignments from any direction. It's a dilemma."

"Is your mood always so changeable?"

"Yeah, a bit?"

Song Jaebeom responded nonchalantly to Han Daye's question.

Before returning, Song Jaebeom's mood swings were quite frequent.

He was usually relaxed but had a sentimental side.

"Anyway, as I mentioned last time, come to our shop when you need to print something. I promised to give a discount to classmates."

"Thanks. I'll definitely go."

When Rowoon spoke sincerely, Song Jaebeom nodded.

"Yeah, I'm telling you to come. Daye, you too."

"Okay, I'll go if the time works out."

"By the way, have you both thought about what brand you'll choose?"

Song Jaebeom alternated his gaze between his friends.

"Well..."

Han Daye, who was impressed by Rowoon's spoon presentation last time, thought about looking for something close and humble rather than grand.

But since she wasn't sure yet, she passed the baton to Rowoon.

"Rowoon, what brand will you choose?"

He was curious about what brand Rowoon would pick this time. Knowing in advance might be helpful.

But Rowoon, not having any ideas yet, slightly shook his head.

"Well, I'll have to think about it."

Feeling slightly disappointed, Han Daye and Song Jaebeom waved their hands as they parted ways.

After parting with his friends, Rowoon entered the lab.

"Oh, Rowoon. You're early."

"The previous class ended a bit early."

The professor was out, and instead, graduate students welcomed Rowoon.

Rowoon quickly tidied up some messy things and sat at his designated spot.

A chair with a comfortable backrest and a spacious desk.

Feeling good about having his own place, he playfully ran his palm over the desk.

A clean computer desktop.

"Only the necessary programs are installed."

Since the computer lab can't be used during classes and the shared computers had many inconveniences, it was nice to use it freely.

"Shall I start by looking up brands?"

Click, click.

The sound of the mouse wheel rolling.

Following one eye-catching link after another.

Rowoon got deeply immersed in his search.

The important thing for this assignment was to show how well he could utilize the digital tools learned in class so far.

Since it was a class for first-year students who hadn't yet grasped the concept of design clearly.

But Rowoon wanted to go beyond that.

"I don't intend to treat this as just an assignment. What's important is making something of my own."

He intended to build his portfolio rather than just doing the assignment.

Creating a result that wouldn't be embarrassing to show anywhere.

Rowoon focused on finding a brand again.

From famous overseas brands with distinct colors,

To domestic brands he had heard of at least once.

As he looked at those big brands on the screen,

Ideas fluttered up like soap bubbles.

But those fluffy ideas,

"Feel just out of reach."

Probably because these brands were too high up.

They felt realistically out of reach for Rowoon, a first-year university student.

The idea of designing promotional materials for such famous brands and companies felt like a child writing a letter to Santa Claus.

"If possible, it would be nice to design something that can be applied realistically."

Thinking it would be a design that wouldn't reach them,

The inspiration bubbled up like a soap bubble and then floated away.

Maybe someday it would reach, but not yet.

Just then, a vibrating sound interrupted Rowoon's thoughts.

It was a message from Tak Moosuk.

[Tak Moosuk sunbae] Is the meeting time for Charming tomorrow okay?

"Looks like it's about to start."

With a bit of anticipation, Rowoon replied, "Yes."

He was curious about what the art volunteer club was like and who the people in Charming were.

Bzz-

This time, the vibration came from over there.

Ok Dalsu, who had his head shaved, looked at his phone and then called Rowoon's name.

Despite his fierce appearance, his tone was friendly.

"Rowoon."

"Yes?"

"Are you free the evening after tomorrow? They said we should have dinner at Deakin."

Deakin was the mid-sized company to which they had recently sent a report.

For a hungry student living alone, a dinner appointment was welcome news.

"Yes, I'm free."

Two appointments were made in an instant.

**

At a pasta restaurant near Rowoon's house.

The place where he had previously had an interview with Baek Iryeong, the members of the volunteer club Charming gathered.

"Looks like this is the hideout."

About a dozen members participated today.

Interestingly, one could roughly tell who were Seohan University students and who were from Yuil Arts University.

Seohan University students generally wore glasses.

Yuil Arts University students had a more free-spirited fashion sense.

But as he sat quietly and listened to their conversations, it was clear that people from very diverse departments had gathered.

Economics, pharmacy, statistics, and computer engineering from Seohan University...

Music creation, dance, and aesthetics from Yuil Arts University...

"It really is great for building a diverse network."

He could see why so many people wanted to join this club.

He thought he recognized some faces from media interviews before returning...

"Is this everyone for today? Then let's start the meeting."

Everyone focused on Baek Iryeong, who seemed more charismatic than last time.

"As you all know, the three people sitting in front are the new members."

Baek Iryeong pointed to the new members sitting nearby.

Curious gazes gathered toward the front.

"This is Lee Rowoon from Yuil Arts University. And the other two are Jung Saeun and Park Chulsoo from Seohan University."

"What's your major at Yuil Arts University?"

In response to someone's question, Baek Iryeong answered calmly.

"Design."

Although no one showed it, there was a sense of interest.

In this club, the position of art students was quite significant.

Everyone gathered with a desire to volunteer, but art wasn't something that came easily.

Strictly selecting members made it even harder for suitable art students to join the club.

Baek Iryeong continued.

"As you know, everyone here went through fierce competition to get in, so they are precious members."

"What was the competition rate this time?"

"I think it was about 15:1."

"Our club is still alive and kicking."

Someone remarked proudly.

"So it's true that many people want to join this club."

As Rowoon thought about that, Baek Iryeong announced to everyone.

"The first volunteer activity with the new members will be at the Dandelion Care Center."

At that moment, the atmosphere subtly changed.

The expressions of the club members turned slightly dark.

The care center was a service run by the local government to look after elementary school students after school or on weekends.

They provided experiential activities and other education to children in blind spots.

"Any good ideas for the art class, like last time?"

" ..."

A moment of silence passed.

Everyone was actively participating in the meeting, but they seemed hesitant.

Then, someone cautiously spoke up.

"Last time, the kids couldn't concentrate, and we barely managed to conduct the class. Wouldn't it be difficult there? Maybe we should try a few more times before taking the new members..."

Charming had various activities, and the Dandelion Care Center was a place they had only visited a few times.

They had little experience and weren't yet close to the kids.

Moreover, it was hard to get the kids to focus, and the last class was a complete mess.

Baek Iryeong's lips tightened as she remembered that difficult day.

"No, we should try it together even if it's difficult. I think everyone expected some level of difficulty when they joined."

She looked around at the worried members and was the first to suggest an idea.

"How about this, kids? Drawing famous paintings."

"Hmm... sounds good? It could also be an educational experience about famous paintings."

As the atmosphere eased, people started to offer their opinions one by one.

The new member, Jung Saeun, was also proactive.

"How about making animals with clay?"

"Last time, we tried making bowls with clay, but the kids smashed and threw the clay everywhere, making a mess..."

"Oh... I'm sorry."

"No need to apologize. We didn't expect that either."

"How about making flower bouquets with origami?"

"Drawing the face of the person next to you might be good too."

Everyone was actively participating in the meeting.

This seemed to be the usual atmosphere here.

After gathering opinions for a while, Baek Iryeong looked around at everyone.

Then her gaze naturally fell on Rowoon.

But Rowoon didn't seem ready to offer his opinion yet.

"Maybe it's natural for it to be like this on the first day."

It was important to grasp the overall atmosphere.

It was just a bit disappointing because the other new members were relatively proactive.

"Do you have any good ideas?"

When Baek Iryeong casually asked Rowoon, who happened to make eye contact,

"I have something important to say."

Rowoon finally spoke up.

Everyone's attention quickly focused there.

Rowoon carefully thought whether it was right to say this on his first day.

"But if I don't say it now, it won't work."

Because if they conducted the class with the ideas just suggested, it was bound to be a mess again.

Rowoon knew well from his time in the orphanage.

What kids reacted to and what they quickly lost interest in.

"If we conduct the class as suggested, the result will be the same as last time."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean the kids won't be able to concentrate."

The club members' faces stiffened at the direct language.

But Rowoon continued without hesitation.

"Charming's classes are no different from school classes."

Putting other things aside, he thought they needed to realize the problem quickly.

Otherwise, no matter what class they conducted, the same result would repeat.

Fortunately, someone uttered a realization.

"Do you mean that even though it's a new class for us, it wasn't for the kids?"

"Yes, to the kids, it probably felt like a repeat of school lessons."

The kids, likely not very interested in school classes.

Conducting the same kind of class for them again could have felt like torture.

Tak Moosuk, with his arms crossed, supported Rowoon's opinion.

"That makes sense. We would get bored too if we had to listen to the same lecture after our major classes."

University students had little connection with the kids outside of volunteer activities.

And since they weren't experts in art education, it was something they hadn't considered.

"So we need to plan a class that can spark interest, different from school lessons."

"This is an unexpected opinion."

"It's true. So what should we do?"

While the confused club members murmured among themselves, Baek Iryeong also thought deeply.

But no clear answer came to mind.

With a pen at her lips, Baek Iryeong asked,

"So what kind of art class would spark interest? For example..."

Everyone's eyes turned to Rowoon.

In fact, without suggesting examples, talking about differentiation and interest had no meaning.

It would just be criticizing the existing method without offering alternatives.

Even if they theoretically understood the problem, many things in the world couldn't be improved.

So while skeptical gazes surrounded Rowoon,

His eyes landed on the biscuits on the table.

Rectangular cookies served as a basic service.

An idea quickly came to him, and he picked up the biscuits with both hands.

And then,

"For example, something like this."

He tilted the rectangular biscuits from both sides to form a shape.

The shape of a Korean letter, 'ㅅ'.

" ... A cookie house."

"Yes, a making class using cookies. Art doesn't have to be drawing on paper."

A class that could attract the attention of elementary students with low concentration, while also serving as a making class.

An art activity they could never try in school.

"Making a cookie house."

It was a creative idea no one had thought of.
