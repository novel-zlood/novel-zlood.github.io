The Study of the Vice President of Shinhwa Group.

In the study, which was predominantly decorated in dark gray tones, only the occasional sound of pages turning and the sharp friction of a pen could be heard.

Breaking the silence, he asked his secretary.

"When is Daye supposed to arrive?"

"She should be here in about twenty minutes."

"Alright, it's her first meal here since she left."

Today was the day the father and daughter were scheduled to have a meal together after a long time.

Without lifting his eyes from the documents, he asked his secretary again.

"Do you know anything about how Daye is living these days?"

"I'm not entirely sure, but it seems like she is enjoying her university life."

Since he couldn't follow her around openly anymore, he had to rely on stories based on her social media.

"I'm worried she might be living recklessly now that she's been given some freedom..."

Han Taeho's brows furrowed.

"I don't think that's the case. I'm sure she is still trying hard to meet your expectations, Vice President."

Although the secretary tried to alleviate his concerns, Han Taeho's voice revealed his displeasure.

"Didn't she miss out on being the top student when she got admitted?"

"···."

She was beaten by an orphan whom he had sponsored.

A child who hadn't even been doing art for long.

He couldn't forget the ambiguous feeling he had on the day he found out that Rowoon was the top student and Han Daye was the second.

From an outsider's perspective, the result produced by Rowoon was quite impressive.

Thus, the sponsorship itself was seen as a good investment.

However.

"My daughter must have been complacent."

For now, he could only wait and see how things would unfold.

"You've seen that child's painting, right? It got high scores because it had a style that hadn't been seen before. Now that Daye knows her competition, she will work even harder."

"That's exactly her problem. She only does just enough to win. From what I've seen, she can do more."

Han Taeho clicked his tongue.

"What could be the problem? Raising a child isn’t as easy as I thought."

Whether fortunate or unfortunate.

His daughter did follow the standards he had set, but she had never shown anything beyond that.

Hence, the subtle uneasiness he felt.

It was like controlling an RC car that didn't quite match the controls perfectly.

Especially when she had half-threatened him by using her admission to Yuil Arts University as an excuse to live on her own.

"She will gradually realize that there's nothing special out there."

This time, he had deliberately let her win.

He thought that once she realized there was nothing special about living independently, she would focus on her present life.

He hoped that Rowoon, the top student, would serve as an incentive for Daye.

If it made her realize that doing just enough wasn't sufficient, then the sponsorship would be worth it.

After a while.

The sound of two spoons clinking on the neat, white-toned table echoed loudly.

With the uncomfortable atmosphere, food went down Han Daye's throat with difficulty.

'It feels even more suffocating since I haven't been here for a while.'

Contrary to Han Taeho's expectations, she was very satisfied with her current free lifestyle.

It felt like she could finally breathe.

At that moment, Han Taeho's heavy voice filled the area around the dining table.

"Are you doing well in school?"

"···Yes."

"You must be paying attention to your grades from now on."

"The semester just started."

"Complacency only leads to the same results as before."

It hadn't been long since they started eating, but it already felt like a board meeting.

Her throat felt tight. Han Daye put down her spoon and drank some water.

But Vice President Han Taeho continued speaking.

"I expect you to manage well. If not, I'll bring you back to this house because you can't do it alone."

Han Daye bit her lips hard, making sure it wasn't visible.

"Isn't it about time he comes?"

In Professor Jihwasan's lab.

Shin Kihoon and Ok Dalsu, who had participated in the last project, were anxiously waiting for him.

"He said he would be here around this time."

Rowoon, who was organizing papers on a cluttered desk, said while tapping the documents together.

He was working part-time as a student assistant in the lab.

Unaware that Jihwasan had created this position specifically for him.

"I hope he comes soon."

A few days ago, they had sent a report to the home appliance brand, Dikin.

They were waiting to see the outcome of the meeting.

Shin Kihoon, who seemed to own various hats, was wearing a bucket hat today.

Because of it, he couldn't focus and was shaking his leg vigorously.

'It's understandable.'

The result of weeks of hard work was about to come out.

Although Rowoon only participated for a few days, he was equally anxious to see the results.

He hoped it would be good news for left-handed people across the country.

"Rowoon, you can leave the organizing and do your own work."

"Okay, I'll just finish this."

Rowoon was about to wet a cloth to wipe the desk when the door suddenly opened.

Professor Jihwasan had just returned to the lab.

"Where are you going?"

"To the bathroom for a moment."

"These guys always say they’re going to the bathroom when I ask."

From his usual indifferent expression, it was hard to gauge the feedback.

He took off the jacket he had dressed up in and hung it on a hanger.

Shin Kihoon awkwardly stood up from his seat.

"Welcome back."

"Yeah, have you had lunch?"

"Not yet."

He fiddled with some papers on Jihwasan's desk and then asked.

"So... was there any particular feedback from them?"

Gulp.

The sound of swallowing saliva was followed by other eager ears perking up.

Rowoon also postponed his bathroom trip and started wiping a nearby table with a dry cloth.

Even a designer with industry authority couldn't avoid the emotional turmoil of client feedback.

If they weren't satisfied, they might be stuck in revision hell for a while.

They had done their best, so the tension was inevitable.

Everyone was intently watching Jihwasan's lips when he said.

"They liked it very much."

In an instant, Jihwasan's expression brightened.

"Good job, everyone."

"Phew."

Sighs of relief were heard from all around.

Jihwasan recalled the words of the representative from the meeting today.

'As expected, Professor, your depth is unmatched. Especially the glass window part of this coffee pot received great feedback in the meeting. It not only enhances the design but also caters to left-handed customers.'

'Haha, that was done by the youngest member of our lab.'

'The youngest? You have an excellent student. Please let me treat your lab members to a meal whenever you have time.'

With a satisfied smile, he looked around at the people in the lab.

"They suggested having a meal together soon, and it will be a nice one."

"Wow, are we finally going to have steak instead of pork cutlets?"

Shin Kihoon pretended to cut steak and rejoiced.

Jihwasan, who was rolling up his sleeves, nonchalantly said.

"What's wrong with pork cutlets? Anyway, Rowoon will also join us that day."

"Me too?"

Rowoon pointed at himself with his finger.

He had only participated for a few days, yet they were including him in such an important event.

"Of course, you have to come with us."

"Yeah, you did such an important job."

Ok Dalsu, who was also tall while seated, chimed in.

The graduate students, now relieved, tapped away on their computers with ease.

Although the project was over, they were working on their own assignments.

When asked why they were doing their personal assignments in the lab, it was because the school provided them with their only personal space.

Despite being strict while working, Jihwasan took good care of them once they were part of the lab.

Thus, the lab was a love-hate relationship for them.

At that moment, Rowoon, who had just finished cleaning, bowed his head.

"Then I'll be going now."

"Where are you going?"

"To the computer room to work on my assignment."

Knock, knock, knock.

Just then, someone knocked on the lab door.

"Professor, I brought the computer you requested."

"Ah, install it over there at the empty desk."

The professor pointed to the desk Rowoon had just cleaned.

He stopped Rowoon, who was about to leave.

"That will be your desk from now on."

"Pardon?"

"If you're going to work here, you need a desk. You can work on your assignments here, too. Just vacate the desk when there's an important meeting."

Compared to the indifferent Jihwasan, Shin Kihoon was greatly impressed.

"Wow, Rowoon, you might be the only first-year student with a personal desk at school."

**

First-year class.

Students were diligently drawing hand sketches on spacious drafting tables.

Although hand sketches are rare these days, doing them firsthand helps understand the principles better.

The professor walked around checking the students' sketches.

"It's more difficult and requires more patience than you thought, right?"

Students who thought drawing lines wouldn't be difficult felt their fingers cramping from the intense pressure.

Controlling the strength and adjusting the vertical and horizontal lines took a lot of time.

'Ah, my back.'

Han Daye straightened her back for a moment and tapped her back.

Then she noticed Rowoon's face in front of her.

Unlike the other students who wore pained expressions, Rowoon's eyes sparkled with joy.

He genuinely seemed to find the class itself enjoyable.

'...Does he really enjoy this?'

A sigh escaped her.

There's a saying.

A genius can't beat a hardworking person, and a hardworking person can't beat someone who enjoys it.

From Han Daye's perspective, Rowoon was definitely enjoying it.

But then, her father's stern face flashed in her mind.

'But I have to win. Otherwise, my freedom is over.'

Motivated, Han Daye bent back down and focused on her drafting.

After the drafting class ended, Song Jaebeom let out a sigh of relief.

"At least the next class is with Professor Eunsungyeon, so we're safe."

"Why?"

"Because it's about using tools, it's not as burdensome. I'm the son of a printing shop owner, remember?"

He boasted proudly, as if it was something to be proud of.

But shortly after, Professor Eunsungyeon entered the room and said.

"Now that you've learned the basics of using the tools, it's time for a proper assignment."

It was like a bolt from the blue.

The class wouldn't be easy anymore.

"Till now, you've been learning the tools for design purposes. So, what can you create with these tools?"

"Posters!"

"Brochures."

"Various illustrations and promotional materials."

Confident voices erupted from here and there.

She was pleased to hear the desired answers.

"Advertisements or promotional materials play a crucial role between companies and consumers. They promote brand images and encourage consumer purchases."

After a short pause, she continued.

"Designers convey the brand's intent visually to consumers. For this assignment, you'll choose a brand and design advertisements or promotional materials for its products or the brand itself.

This assignment will replace the midterm exam."

As soon as the word "midterm" was mentioned, the students buzzed.

"Since all you've learned so far are the tools, I'll evaluate how well you can utilize them."

At that moment, someone raised their hand.

"When you say advertisements or promotional materials, what are the boundaries?"

It was like asking about the exam scope.

"Anything in print format will be accepted. If you prepare a variety of things, you'll get more points, but if you prepare too much and the overall quality drops, you won't get good grades. It's all up to you."

University is a place for self-directed learning.

How you spend your time is up to you.

Professor Eunsungyeon believed it was best to do as much as possible within the university's boundaries, but she intended to let the students manage on their own.

Lastly, she announced the most important fact.

"All the results will be exhibited in the first-floor lobby for a while. So, you'll need to pay more attention. Everyone, including professors, seniors, and students from other departments, will see it."

'An exhibition?'

'What should I do?'

The students murmured.

The assignment was to test their application of the tools.

So, Professor Eunsungyeon expected an amateurish result.

After all, the students hadn't learned much about design yet.

But she intended to exhibit the results.

She wanted the students to shed their high school student attitudes and take a step forward as aspiring designers.

To take the assignments more seriously.

The unexpected news about the exhibition made the first-year students' faces show undeniable pressure.

On the other hand, Rowoon felt excited.

'This will be my first exhibition.'

The opportunity to showcase his creations to others was something he never had in his previous life.

For his first-ever exhibition.

'I have to give it my all.'

Rowoon's eyes sparkled with determination.
