After watching Rowoon doing nothing for a long time, future Manager Yoon smirked.

‘Great, one down.’

This was because he thought that Rowoon had been intimidated by his initial pressure.

Since creating a drawing within the given 4 hours is already a tough battle, it was safe to say that Rowoon, who hadn’t drawn anything for about an hour, was essentially out of the competition.

But that was a huge misconception.

In a fleeting moment, he saw Rowoon holding a pencil.

That was all there was.

‘Well, at least he’s trying to do something.’

With a sneer, he focused on his drawing for a moment.

How many minutes had passed?

A strange sound kept reaching his ears.

Swish, swish.

‘…?’

The moment he turned back to look at Rowoon’s drawing, Manager Yoon couldn’t believe his eyes.

Rowoon’s pencil was smoothly gliding over the paper as if skating on ice.

In just a few minutes, Rowoon’s sketch was almost complete.

‘What, what is this?’

It felt like Rowoon was filling the canvas as if he had known all along what to draw.

Manager Yoon rubbed his eyes, thinking he was hallucinating, but the result was the same.

And the moment he realized this was reality…

‘This is bad.’

A thrilling sense of crisis gripped Manager Yoon's neck.

This was because Rowoon’s single strokes had already surpassed the level of his own sketch, which he had worked on for about an hour.

Other kids were also glancing at Rowoon’s drawing.

Moreover, the supervisor who had sensed something earlier had already been drawn into Rowoon’s drawing.

‘Who is this kid…?’

Having finished his sketch, Rowoon now picked up a round size 10 brush.

He had diligently practiced his brushwork at the academy.

Until calluses formed on his hands.

Pouring in the desperate feelings he had while drawing with trembling hands.

Thanks to that, he was called a tenacious guy, a tough nut.

But nothing could stop the exhilaration he felt while drawing.

Tap, tap.

When he moistened the dry brush, the elasticity returned.

Adjusting the consistency of the thick paint, sometimes thin, sometimes thick.

Rowoon’s bold brushstrokes drew clear arcs on the canvas.

Rowoon boldly applied the colors as if he knew exactly where to paint.

He just instinctively knew where to paint next, and his hand moved accordingly.

As what he had envisioned clearly appeared before his eyes, the exhilaration began to rise.

‘This feels good.’

A satisfied smile gradually spread across Rowoon’s lips.

As time passed, the density of the drawing increased.

Pastel for large areas.

Colored pencils for detailed textures.

The drawing gradually revealed a photo-like clarity.

Rowoon, fully immersed in his drawing, seemed to be venting his emotions.

An obsession to pour out everything he had learned and that was within him.

The kids watching him completely lost their pace.

The moment they lost confidence.

That would inevitably show in their drawings.

‘Why did he have to sit next to me? It’s too late to start over now…’

Future Manager Yoon’s face was the palest among them.

Seeing Rowoon’s drawing made his own idea of interpreting the circles as a soccer ball feel too simplistic.

‘I envy those who haven’t seen his drawing.’

But since he couldn't turn back time, he continued to grudgingly fill in his drawing, but his gaze kept drifting back.

Rowoon was drawing an old man’s face.

The two circles had become the glasses the old man was wearing, placed over his face.

One lens transparently reflected the old man’s eye.

The other lens reflected a photo of the old man’s childhood.

The beginning and end of a human life.

Rowoon was capturing that on a single canvas.

“Ai, there’s nothing to see here. This isn’t fun at all.”

Professor Jihwasan walked around the grading room with his hands behind his back.

He was known as an eccentric as much as he was known for his outstanding abilities.

His assistant pointed to other drawings laid out on the floor.

“Professor, the drawings over here…”

“Are those drawings? I thought it was a pile of recycling paper. What’s with the soccer balls? I feel like kicking them away.”

Professor Jihwasan pretended to kick the drawings.

It wasn’t that he was grading carelessly; he was genuinely frustrated by the subpar works.

“Soccer balls, baseballs, basketballs. It’s a mess. Did they mistake this for a physical education entrance exam? What do they think of our school’s level?”

“Professor…”

“Yeah, right. It would’ve been better if they had at least represented the Olympics. Give that one an A.”

The assistant broke into a cold sweat in front of the harsh evaluation.

What Professor Jihwasan valued the most was creativity.

His belief was that objects designed without thought were nothing but pretty trash.

Thus, drawings that rendered circles into balls were like trash to him.

More than anything, he wanted to select students who had their own thoughts.

Just then, Professor Eunsungyeon, who was evaluating nearby, stepped in like a savior for the struggling assistant.

“Professor Ji, if you do it that way, we won’t be able to select anyone. Please be a bit more considerate.”

“I am being considerate. But we can’t just pick anyone.”

“But the overall quality is higher than last year.”

She smiled elegantly in her sleek suit.

She was the only one who could speak so frankly to him.

Professor Jihwasan sighed deeply.

“Alright, we do need to select some.”

He took a few deep breaths to calm his excitement.

Then he began to grade the drawings in the order they appeared.

“That one over there, B. The one below, E, D, D.”

Each drawing took less than three seconds to grade.

At a glance, it might seem too hasty, but this evaluation method wasn’t much different from other schools.

Three seconds.

That was enough for a seasoned eye to see what the artist had been thinking while drawing.

It was when the evaluation started to pick up speed.

Professor Jihwasan suddenly stopped in his tracks.

One drawing from a distance caught his eye.

“Hey, Assistant Park. What’s that?”

“Pardon? What do you mean?”

“Never mind, I’ll go see it myself.”

Professor Jihwasan hopped over the drawings laid out on the floor to avoid stepping on them.

Then he stopped in front of the drawing that had piqued his curiosity and stared intently.

“Professor, why are you…?”

The assistant, clueless, followed him, hopping the same way.

But before he could finish his sentence, he understood.

Why Professor Ji had suddenly changed direction.

“Wow, this feels like an eye-opener, doesn’t it?”

After staring at the drawing for a while, Professor Ji lifted his head.

There was a rare look of satisfaction on his face.

Known for being stingy with compliments, even in his classes, the assistant nodded like a malfunctioning machine, startled.

The drawing depicted an old man’s face full of wrinkles.

The rough skin of the old man was so realistically portrayed that it made one pause in thought, contrasting with his bright eyes.

The assistant lowered his head and appreciated the drawing.

‘Despite the close-up of the old man’s face, there’s no awkwardness at all.’

Highlighting strengths and concealing weaknesses.

That was one strategy in art exams.

But this drawing revealed everything honestly without hiding anything.

As if to say, ‘I can draw anything this well.’

While immersed in the drawing and staring at the old man’s eyes, the assistant noticed something new.

“Wow… The old man is looking at a photo of his childhood. The theme is expressed as a person’s life, not just a single scene.”

“Exactly, this kid has a mind. And look closely, see where we set the conditions.”

“Oh, the glasses frame…!”

The assistant was so absorbed in the drawing that he hadn’t even noticed the conditions.

The two circles naturally became the old man’s glasses frame without being forced.

Professor Ji straightened his back and glanced around.

While other drawings tried hard to fit the conditions and become ‘like drawings,’ Rowoon had boldly depicted the old man’s face.

The most natural drawing.

Thus, it stood out even more, ironically.

Professor Ji chuckled and said,

“Do you know what this kid considered most important while drawing this?”

“How to get accepted…?”

“Wrong. He ignored all the strategies and types he learned at the academy and only thought about the ‘drawing’ he wanted to create.”

Recklessness.

Or immense confidence.

There wasn’t a trace of concern about fitting the preferred type of the art school.

His idea of the theme.

And the most effective way to convey it.

In the midst of other drawings trying hard to please the judges, this one shone brightly.

‘This is it.’

This was the type of student Professor Ji wanted the most.

However, finding such a student was like plucking a star from the sky.

Using the long stick he held, Professor Ji elaborated further.

“Look closely. First, the old man’s face. Then his eyes. And then the photo reflected in the glasses.”

“Aha…!”

“This was designed so that your gaze flows within it. Isn’t it fascinating?”

In entrance exam art, there was a golden rule.

Focus on the main object first, then let the gaze flow into the background, creating a sense of space.

But in Rowoon’s drawing, the gaze flowed in a unique way.

It was hard to believe that a student who attended an art academy could draw so creatively.

“Do you think he did this knowingly?”

“Whether knowingly or instinctively, one thing is certain, he’s exceptional.”

Professor Ji chuckled.

With great interest, he discerned one more thing from the drawing.

‘Drawings inevitably reflect the artist.’

Despite being a well-depicted old man's eye, it stared back at him clearly.

That gaze surely reflected the artist who drew this picture.

‘Curiosity and desire about the world, a sense of challenge. What kind of kid has such eyes?’

“Hahahahaha.”

Professor Jihwasan’s hearty laughter echoed in the grading room.

“We can’t not pick this one!”

He was too curious.

Who was this student who drew this picture?

What kind of eyes would a kid who drew such a picture have?

“What kind of drawing is it that you’re so excited about?”

Other professors began to gather, drawn by Professor Ji’s reaction.

**

The academy was still busy preparing for the third round of exams.

The atmosphere was tense, with students who had already passed or failed the first round.

‘Although I’m more interested in Yuil Art University than other schools…’

Rowoon was also preparing for the third round for the sake of Director Bae, who let him attend the academy for free.

Passing even one more school would help with the academy’s publicity.

At that moment, Director Bae, looking pale, gestured to Rowoon.

“Rowoon, it’s time for the announcement.”

It seemed Director Bae couldn’t bear the anxiety as the announcement time for Yuil Art University approached.

To check it exactly at the right moment, Rowoon took a seat in front of the computer in the lobby.

Left, Assistant Tak. Right, Director Bae.

“Why are you all gathered here instead of drawing?”

When the academy kids flocked over, the director scolded them.

Park Changhoon, the student representative, made a playful comment.

“Hey, Rowoon is our academy’s ace. We should all check together.”

In reality, the kids were too curious to hold back.

Could this neighborhood really produce a Yuil Art University student?

Everyone held their breath and gathered around.

Click.

The sound of the mouse button echoed through the entire lobby.

And then.

“It’s up!”

At Park Changhoon’s shout, everyone’s eyes scanned the screen as if they would pop out.

[Yuil Art University]

Congratulations, Lee Rowoon, on your acceptance.

*Selected as an excellent scholarship student in the Integrated Design Department (100% tuition coverage for 4 years)
