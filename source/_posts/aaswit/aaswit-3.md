People were freely moving around the event hall.

Among them, some were watching kids draw. As they slowly scanned the children, their gazes naturally stopped at Rowoon's spot.

"Look over there."

"Where?"

"The boy in the middle drawing in a unique way."

Rowoon's way of drawing was distinctly different.

He swung his pencil broadly like a conductor's baton.

The pencil marks left like afterimages.

If you watched him boldly draw lines,

"It looks like he's trying to finish quickly and carelessly, right?"

One might think so at first glance.

Like a student hastily filling out an exam sheet and then dozing off.

But if you paused and watched for a moment,

"No, look closely!"

"...Huh? He's not just drawing randomly, is he?"

You could see that the seemingly spontaneous lines were coming together to form accurate shapes.

Watching this, Shim, the director of Hope Orphanage, widened her eyes in disbelief.

"...Did Rowoon always draw so well?"

She knew he liked drawing.

But to see him casually capture forms like that.

It wasn't something that could be achieved with just a day or two of practice.

Excited by Shim's admiration, elementary schooler Jihan spoke up.

"He's good, right, Director? Rowoon hyung's drawing is like magic."

To Jihan, it seemed like magic that accurate shapes appeared in an instant without any preliminary sketches.

The lines Rowoon was drawing soon formed a bird.

Whenever he occasionally turned his head, there was a bird similar to the one on his canvas flapping its wings among the branches.

The interest of Bae, the director of the nearby art academy, naturally shifted to Rowoon.

‘His drawing style is quite bold.’

Among the other kids, some also drew birds.

But usually, they were small parts of the park's scenery.

Because compared to trees or clouds, if you didn't accurately draw the form of a bird, it was easy to reveal your lack of skill.

But Rowoon was drawing a large bird as the central focus, with the background around it.

Capturing the moment its wings were spread.

‘Hmm... there's something unusual about this.’

Director Bae began to scrutinize the drawing more closely.

Even if you gave the same pencil to a hundred people, different lines would appear. That’s art.

In one line lay the person’s thoughts, senses, movements.

Ultimately, because it contained the person themselves.

But Rowoon's lines were,

‘They look raw yet exude confidence. What is this?’

Like a new knife showing signs of long sharpening.

Lines that seemed to strike in one decisive cut.

Combining seemingly incompatible qualities into a unique charm.

After finishing his sketch, Rowoon lifted his pencil from the paper.

Even if the form was well captured, the way color was applied could completely change the artwork.

But there were no coloring tools visible around Rowoon.

‘He must lack confidence in coloring.’

Just as Director Bae was about to look at other kids,

Rowoon laid his pencil flat.

Then,

Sasasasak.

He fiercely darkened the background with the side of his pencil.

"What is he doing after finishing the drawing?"

Director Bae muttered in surprise.

It looked like he was ruining the drawing.

But that wasn’t the case.

"...!"

By darkening the background with graphite, something emerged.

A pure white bird in contrast to the dark background.

Revealing the focus by coloring the background.

An unexpected coloring technique.

"Huh, my."

Director Bae let out a breath of amazement.

The boldness of darkening the background with a pencil.

A raw, unpolished feel in the drawing.

"That's for sure. That's not something you learn."

As Director Bae murmured, Shim from Hope Orphanage suddenly responded.

"Yes, our Rowoon has never learned drawing."

"Rowoon?"

"Yes. He's our child."

Shim proudly pointed towards where Rowoon was.

"He suddenly said he wanted to go to an art college... I never knew he could draw this well."

Emotions of pride, admiration, and guilt passed over her face in order.

To others, the idea of an orphan entering an art college, specifically Yuil Arts University, might seem out of reach.

‘With that level of talent, I have to let him try. At any cost.’

A sense of certainty settled in Shim's heart.

**

With a short bob haircut and thick horn-rimmed glasses.

Eyes that couldn't be hidden even by the glasses scanned the surrounding drawings with boredom.

'Hmm... It's not much, is it?'

Handa-ye, who was participating in the event as a formality, being led by her secretary, was pretending to be a typical model student.

'The Vice President wishes for you to realize how fortunate you are. He said there are many children in the world who can't even dream of pursuing what they want.'

Reflecting on the secretary's words, Handa-ye doodled on her paper.

'It's not that they can't because they want to, it's because they can’t, right?'

From the surrounding drawings, one might think so.

Everyone seemed to lack motivation.

Drawing like that, there was no chance in the art entrance exam scene.

Even before she could walk, Handa-ye's life was designed according to the will of her father, the heir of Shinwa Group.

Study hard, go to Yuil Arts University, get a master's degree in the US, and then take over the cultural and artistic aspects under Shinwa Group.

Essentially taking over the role her grandmother currently held.

But,

Because of that, Handa-ye lacked motivation in her life overall.

She couldn't do anything her way.

What sustained her was the expectation of a free university life.

'Just watch. I'll live my way then.'

A rebellious smile appeared on Handa-ye's face.

At that moment, murmurs were heard from behind.

Voices of adults watching the competition.

"That's amazing."

"He hasn't even taken lessons, is that innate?"

Handa-ye was drawing in a way that wouldn't draw attention.

She had no desire to show off her skills among the orphanage kids.

'So it's not about me.'

Her secretary was also looking at something through her sunglasses.

Curious, Handa-ye peeked around her easel.

Then,

A boy sitting in front of the easel’s blind spot.

"...What is he doing?"

The way the boy was drawing stood out significantly.

Typically, when doing a sketch, shading is built up by layering pencil touches.

It’s a method that allows for smooth transitions in value.

And it’s easier to correct mistakes.

Pressing the pencil firmly to create darkness in one go leaves marks that can't be erased cleanly.

But Rowoon’s boldness in breaking this unspoken rule from the start was intriguing.

"Is he doing that because he doesn't know, or because he does?"

Handa-ye was learning drawing through one-on-one private lessons.

She was quick to grasp and had a natural talent, earning the label of genius from her teacher.

But to Handa-ye, who had learned the orthodox way, Rowoon's method was not just unconventional, it was shocking.

Yet Rowoon wasn't just haphazardly scribbling.

The bird stood out, emphasized by the contrast, and the park scenery was all there in the increasingly loose background.

‘Are you saying... you're sure you won't be wrong?’

Handa-ye smirked as she observed Rowoon's drawing, and suddenly realized.

It was an innate sense being expressed without learning.

And as her father intended,

‘So, with such clear talent, he can't even attend an academy?’

She realized the reality.

The reality where even if you excel, you might not be able to flourish.

Though she saw the boy for the first time, she felt his talent was a pity, and it was bittersweet.

‘So I should be grateful for what I have.’

The conclusion was flowing as her father intended.

But comparing herself to those who had less and feeling relief wasn’t her style.

Instead of being pleased with her situation, she felt a growing sense of discomfort.

Meanwhile, the secretary who had been watching Rowoon from the back,

“Yes, Vice President. There is a distinctly outstanding child, so I’m reporting.”

was reporting about Rowoon to someone.

**

The awarding ceremony proceeded quickly.

The announcer called the winners one by one from the stage set up in a corner of the event hall.

And the gold prize for the day went to,

"Lee Rowoon from Hope Orphanage! Please come forward."

Rowoon ran up to the podium, and the other kids from the same orphanage looked both happy and surprised.

Jihan jumped with excitement, and Director Shim hastily took out her phone to take pictures.

"He uniquely expressed the look of our park through a freely flying bird. The judges unanimously selected Rowoon's work. Congratulations!"

Although it was just a competition among the orphanage children, the fact that people recognized his drawing meant the most.

In the past, his drawings were dismissed.

Back then, he was criticized for having no foundation.

But as a high school student, Rowoon could build his foundation from now on.

And today, Rowoon laid a foundation.

Returning to his seat with a set of professional drawing tools given as the first prize, Jihan kept exclaiming, “Wow, wow.”

“You did great, kids. Now go and have fun.”

Director Shim gave them free time.

The kids immediately ran off to enjoy the event,

And as she stayed behind, looking at the prize Rowoon received with pride,

“You have a talent at Hope Orphanage.”

“His drawing is really unique. Director Shim, you must be pleased.”

“He should definitely become an artist.”

Other orphanage directors gathered around to offer their congratulations.

As the atmosphere grew more cheerful,

“He’s talented, but aren't you inflating things a bit?”

A chubby male director broke the mood.

“Pardon? What do you mean?”

“I mean, can you afford to teach art with Hope Orphanage’s budget?”

A moment of silence followed.

Other orphanages faced similar challenges, but Hope Orphanage’s situation was more dire.

Besides the basic budget, they had no corporate sponsors.

Being the most rural greatly affected this.

“And making such a fuss over winning a competition among orphanage kids. You’re just giving the child false hope.”

The chubby director wasn’t entirely wrong.

After all, a child in an orphanage.

Expecting something from art in reality was a tall order.

Hearing this right after deciding to find a way to teach art made Director Shim’s face darken.

As others began to awkwardly glance around,

“Director of Hope Orphanage!”

They saw Director Bae from the 'Afternoon of Creation' art academy rushing over.

He had taken another close look at Rowoon's drawing displayed at the event.

Rowoon’s drawing was certainly far from conventional style.

Typically, good grades from the start.

Drawing correctly in the orthodox way.

Naturally, such students were preferred by directors.

But Director Bae had a gut feeling that he wouldn’t encounter another student with such talent.

He made a decision.

“You said earlier that Rowoon wants to go to art college.”

“Yes, but the consultation can wait a bit...”

Seeing the tense atmosphere, the orphanage director was hesitant, but Director Bae suddenly exclaimed.

“I want to teach Rowoon at our academy.”

“Pardon?”

“On behalf of my reputation as a director!”

As voices of curiosity murmured around, Director Bae spoke with conviction.

“Until he enters college, we will support Rowoon fully and free of charge!”

With the clarity of the word 'free,'

Eyes around them widened.

Where there’s a will, there’s a way.
