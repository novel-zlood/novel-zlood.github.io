“포트리 사이쉬프(Excellent)―!”

Dmitri exclaimed in his native language. Wasn't it a famous spot in Seoul that he had arrived at with time to spare?

Seoul's Nakwon Instrument Arcade reminded him of the easternmost part of Dresden, Germany. The instruments filling the ceiling and floor, like fruit on trees, gave the illusion of being at the gateway to Dresden, a city of music and art.

“Owner, are you really selling this at this price?”

An old man, who did not understand English, was conversing with Dmitri through body language and broken English.

The old man tapped on the calculator to show the price, and Dmitri, after converting the Korean won to dollars, widened his eyes in disbelief.

The instruments were being sold at incredibly low prices. Due to the impact of the foreign exchange crisis, the demand for instruments was low, making such prices possible.

A sparrow cannot simply pass by a mill. There was a violin that caught Dmitri's attention.

It was an old violin, boasting an elegant appearance that clearly indicated it had been made by a master.

For example, when the bow meets the strings, a much better melody would resonate.

“Owner, I'll take that one.”

However, Dmitri was not at ease even as he paid the full price.

The owner, with his wrinkled hands, personally tuned the violin. His deep eyes resembled those of a father sending off his child.

The old owner with graying hair seemed to be spending the last days of his life with instruments.

Dmitri lowered his posture to meet the gaze of the bent old man.

“Is there a song you would like to hear?”

“Tchaikovsky.”

“Tchaikovsky―!”

Even if words couldn't be understood, their eyes conveyed everything. Dmitri and the old man were communicating fluently before they knew it.

Tchaikovsky's pieces were all complex and required high-level skills, but wasn't Dmitri a top graduate of the Tchaikovsky Conservatory?

Without hesitation, he picked up the old violin.

To perform for the old man.

“A gallery and a music studio.”

It was an unusual combination. However, seeing the gallery's exterior, he quickly understood.

It was a building far superior to any music studio in London.

Holding an old violin case in one hand, Dmitri entered the gallery.

He was still excited after finishing the serenade for the old man. An employee of the gallery soon greeted Dmitri.

“Mister, what brings you here?”

The English pronunciation was proficient. Although he was an uninvited guest who came suddenly, the employee welcomed Dmitri with a constant smile. It was a company with excellent service.

Dmitri felt deeply touched by the consideration he experienced in the East and cleared his throat. He even seemed dignified, like a scene from a Russian movie.

With cold eyes, he faced the employee and uttered the clumsy Korean he had practiced.

“I came to meet Hyun-oppa.”

If the flower of vocal music is opera, then the flower of instrumental music would be the symphony. Kang Hyun was savoring the emotions while listening to Dvořák's "From the New World."

The powerful sound of the trumpet in the scherzo of the third movement was enough to make his heart pound.

The long resonance of the orchestra in the final movement left a lingering taste.

Kang Hyun once again brought the tonearm of the turntable to touch the rings of the LP record.

Starting with Haydn, the father of the symphony, continuing through Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, who led the Romantic era, Brahms, who resisted the trends of his time, Sibelius of Finland, and the highly nationalistic Russian Tchaikovsky and Czech Dvořák, Kang Hyun had spent many days and nights listening to numerous symphonies.

Dudududung―!

Just as the intense melody and the conductor's hand gestures were coming to mind, an unexpected guest arrived to see Kang Hyun.

“Dmitri?”

“Hyun, it's been a long time.”

“I'm really glad to see you. But what brings you here without any notice?”

After hearing the whole story from Dmitri, Kang Hyun nodded.

It was an invitation that any conductor would welcome with open arms, but it wasn't particularly appealing to Kang Hyun.

He preferred sitting in his studio composing grand symphonies over conducting for the British royal family.

“You're probably the only person, Hyun, who would make such a nonchalant face at the chance to conduct for the British royal family.”

“I'm sorry. Actually, I'm not inclined to go to England right now. I was planning to compose my first symphony.”

“A symphony?”

Dmitri widened his eyes in surprise.

Only then did he notice the pile of sheet music in one corner of the studio. It was stacked like a mountain.

“Hyun, are all these scores composed by you?”

“Yes, feel free to take a look.”

“Then I won't hesitate.”

It was a similar reaction to when Baek Junghoon had visited the studio before.

Dmitri couldn't hide his admiration as he browsed through Kang Hyun's compositions. His usually expressionless face was now openly showing his emotions.

“I knew from your solo recital that you had compositional talent, but I didn't expect it to be to this extent. Saying you want to compose a symphony doesn't sound like a lie. By the way, has any other musician visited this studio besides me?”

Even a layperson would know the value of these scores if they had any musical training.

Dmitri was ready to caution Kang Hyun if he said anyone could visit the studio.

At that moment, Kang Hyun recalled a man and looked at Dmitri.

“Dmitri, do you know the pianist Baek Junghoon?”

“How could I not? Pianist Baek Junghoon is famous not only in Asia but also in Europe.”

“He's the only musician who has been in this studio. And when I talked to him earlier, he said he considers you as his role model.”

Dmitri tilted his head in surprise. He had no previous connection with Baek Junghoon, so it made sense.

Baek Junghoon had only seen Dmitri once during his time at the Paris National Conservatory.

Baek Junghoon had talked about that one encounter so much that it had become tiresome. Then it happened.

“Hyun-ah!”

It was impossible to become a nobleman by birth. Baek Junghoon arrived at the studio just in time. When Kang Hyun stood up, Dmitri stood up as well.

Baek Junghoon, upon entering the studio, was puzzled by the unfamiliar foreigner's presence and then widened his eyes in surprise.

As Baek Junghoon couldn't even open his mouth properly in astonishment, Dmitri spoke first.

“Nice to meet you.”

Behind the clumsy greeting was Dmitri's respect for Baek Junghoon, who considered him a role model. It was filled with respect.

“Junghoon-oppa.”

At that moment, Kang Hyun's face turned to one of embarrassment.

Sizzle―!

The white meat of the chicken soup exuded a savory aroma. It would have been perfect with some Bokbunja wine, but what could they do? They had to settle for rice water to wash it down.

Dmitri was already engrossed in eating the chicken soup. It seemed to suit his taste.

“It reminds me of the chicken cream soup my grandmother used to make when I was a child. It's really delicious―!”

Indeed, chicken dishes are universally beloved.

At that moment, the sound of birds chirping outside could be heard. It was a small chicken soup restaurant near Seoul. It was a place he used to visit every weekend when he worked at the Western District Prosecutors' Office.

Back then, it was a small restaurant run by an elderly couple as a hobby, but now it was run by a younger middle-aged couple.

At that moment, Dmitri, who had emptied his bowl, wiped his lips with a tissue and looked at me with a serious expression as if nothing had happened.

“Hyun, are you really not going to England?”

“Dmitri, I'm sorry, but I think it would be better for another conductor to take my place at the British royal event. I still lack the skills and experience.”

“Hyun, the decision is up to the maestro, but such opportunities don't come easily.”

Dmitri's face showed clear signs of regret. He hadn't expected me to refuse. If I had no other choice, I would have chosen to go to England.

However, there were more talented conductors heading to England at the maestro's invitation. There was no need for me to step in.

“Hyun, are you sure you don't want to reconsider?”

Dmitri asked me again, seemingly unable to let go of his disappointment.

“Dmitri, I know it's a great opportunity.”

“And?”

“I do music because I love it, not to become famous. Even if I don't conduct for the British royal family, I'm still me.”

Although I tried to dress it up nicely, the truth was I was eager to complete my symphony as soon as possible. Thanks to the Barbara Light, my pockets were already well-lined.

I no longer needed to chase power and material desires. At that moment, I stood up and looked at Dmitri.

“Dmitri, how about we take a walk?”

* * *

Night falls early in the suburbs of Seoul. It was because there were no artificial neon signs.

As fireflies flew among the bushes, Kang Hyun took out a sheet of music from his pocket and handed it to Dmitri.

It was the first movement of the symphony he had composed. Typically, the first movement is in sonata form and fast, but Kang Hyun's symphony was different.

“Interesting―!”

As expected of an orchestra leader, Dmitri stared at the sheet music as if he were being drawn into it.

Under the moonlight, Dmitri was savoring the sheet music, not missing a single note. How much time had passed?

Dmitri exhaled the breath he had been holding and looked up.

“What about the next part?”

“It's still incomplete.”

“I see. It would indeed be difficult to compose such a symphony in a short time. Now I understand why you don't want to go to England, Hyun. Staying here and completing the symphony is what you truly desire right now.”

He truly had the soul of a musician. Just by looking at the sheet music, he immediately grasped Kang Hyun's intentions.

Originally, Kang Hyun had no intention of showing the symphony to anyone until it was complete, but he couldn't help it.

Dmitri had come all the way from England to Korea to recruit him. Kang Hyun felt he had to show the utmost courtesy.

“Hyun, if it's not too much trouble, may I play the violin part of the first movement?”

“Here?”

“Yes, I happen to have a good instrument.”

Why not? Dmitri brought the old violin case from the car. He said he had bought it in Korea, and although it was unclear where he got it from, it was clearly a master instrument.

Dmitri skillfully checked the tuning, placed the violin on his chin, and used a sapling at waist height as a makeshift stand for the sheet music.

The beautiful melody resonated among the bushes, but Dmitri seemed unsatisfied. At that moment.

“Dmitri, may I help you?”

“How?”

“Let's really perform as written in the first movement. I'll conduct, and you play the violin in sync with my signals. It might help you understand the sheet music better.”

Dmitri's eyes lit up with interest. Kang Hyun slowly took his position and looked at Dmitri.

With eyes of unfathomable depth, Dmitri felt as if he were standing before the maestro himself, filled with tension.

At that moment, as if to open the prelude of the symphony, the piece began, startling Dmitri.

And he saw it. Under the gentle moonlight before complete darkness set in, Kang Hyun conducting.

He poured his soul into the symphony he had created. It was as if his spirit resonated from his fingertips.

When Dmitri finally met Kang Hyun's gaze, he realized.

He hadn't come to Korea to make an offer to Kang Hyun.

He had to take this young maestro to England by any means necessary.

As the wind blew from his fingertips and the old trees sang together.

There was only one violin part out of many in the symphony, but it was enough.

Why, you ask? Because when Kang Hyun slowly raised his hand.

The wind began to blow.
