"I'll go."
Pierre Garnell, the great master from France, raised his wrinkled hand.
Despite his graying hair and age-spotted face, his eyes were still sharp. Known for his reluctance to move, where on earth was he planning to go this time?

“No, I’ll go,” said Deng Lun, the great master from China, with a smile, raising his hand. Suddenly, as if triggered, the other masters began raising their hands in competition.

Eva was beyond flustered, not knowing what to do with the current situation. 

It was customary for the staff to greet Concours participants upon their arrival in Brussels. Of course, it was unprecedented in the history of the Concours for the great masters to personally go out to greet them.

But the situation was different now. The masters gathered in the hall were clamoring to go out themselves. It was utterly bizarre.

“What’s so special about that arrogant kid?” 
Alexei, the great master from Russia, frowned deeply. With his arms crossed in a sulky manner, it was clear he had no intention of raising his hand.

Any violinist would rush over at the mere mention of the names of the great masters gathered here. Yet, this kid had once ignored their proposal.

Yes, a violinist should have that kind of pride. 

One of the masters defended. It sounded like nonsense, but the other masters all agreed. Especially since it was revealed to be true that the kid had no teacher—everyone's expressions turned peculiar. They must all be thinking the same thing.

'Why don't all those who want to go just go?'

But Eva couldn't express her true feelings. These were not just any people—they were great masters. Their musical prowess and pride were sky-high. If they all moved because of one participant, it would be an affront to their dignity. Moreover, there was no guarantee there wouldn’t be any gossip.

“Then, let’s draw lots!”

At that moment, Deng Lun stood up and calmed the audience.

“Hooong―!”

Son Yooha shed chicken poop-sized tears as she stared endlessly at the departure gate where Kang Hyun had disappeared. Crying so much that she might collapse if touched even slightly, she wailed until her voice went hoarse.

While Chairman Wang’s secretary was sweating and trying to console Son Yooha, Chairman Wang appeared with his hands behind his back.

“Chairman Yoo, I’m here.”

“Yooha kept urging me, so I came out without having a proper breakfast. But it seems Hyun has already gone in?”

“Chairman Son, you should have let us know if you were coming. Then Yooha wouldn’t have been so sad.”

Chairman Wang glanced at his granddaughter.

“Well, Yooha was so adamant about not going until yesterday. Who would have thought she’d change her mind overnight? She’s as capricious as any businessman. Anyway, it’s been a long time, Hyunja.”

Kang Hyun’s mother bowed politely to Chairman Wang, a close friend of her father whom she had often seen when she was young. 

However, Kang Hyun's father was struggling to calm his surprise. A figure he had only seen in newspapers and on the news was right in front of him. He might look like a kind old man, but in reality, he was a major figure in the business world.

“Yooha seems very upset. I hope she doesn’t fall ill,” Chairman Wang said, looking at Son Yooha with concern. She was crying so much that anyone might think she had been heartbroken.

He was worried she might throw another tantrum, asking to be sent to wherever Hyun was, just like last time.

At that moment, Chairman Wang’s gaze turned to Hyun's parents. Aha!

“Yooha, come here.”

Son Yooha, trying hard to hold back her tears, walked over. Her gaze was still fixed on the departure gate where Hyun had vanished. Seeing her all dressed up in lace, it was clear how excited she must have been to meet Hyun that morning.

“Greet them. These are Hyun’s parents.”

At the mention of Hyun’s parents, Son Yooha turned her gaze. Her swollen eyes widened, revealing how surprised she was. 

Son Yooha hurriedly wiped her eyes with her sleeve and adjusted her clothes. It was like watching a scene from a comedy, causing Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo to exchange glances.

Hyun's parents were bewildered. A girl they had never seen before had been crying sadly, stopped, and was now approaching them.

“Nice to meet you, Father. Mother,” Son Yooha said in a cracked voice, bowing politely.

There's a saying that a long flight is like mountain climbing. Sitting in one place and flying through the sky for hours is no easy feat. 

But my body seemed to remember my past life, leaning back in the seat and falling into a deep sleep. Long flights had been a place of rest in my past life, so it was a skill I had developed.

The journey from Moscow to Brussels via Russian Airlines. Normally, a flight attendant fluent in both the language of the departure and destination countries would be assigned, but no Korean flight attendant was in sight.

It was a time when international aviation laws were not yet fully established, and few people traveled from Korea to Brussels, so it was understandable.

A Russian flight attendant saw me sitting alone in business class and opened her eyes wide. I was already smaller than my peers, so how would I appear to foreigners?

Especially in Russia, where development is exceptional, they might have mistaken me for a preschooler.

“I’m not eating the in-flight meal, so don’t wake me up.”

When I spoke in Russian, the flight attendant’s eyes widened even more. Though I wasn’t fluent like a native speaker, I could manage enough Russian. My speech was a bit awkward since I had learned it in a short time, but it should suffice, as I wouldn’t need it much more.

Passing through Moscow at dawn and approaching Brussels at sunset.

-Welcome to Belgium, the heart of Europe.

The view of Brussels came into full view.

“Did you say you came alone?”

The immigration officer looked at me curiously. But soon after confirming my Concours visa, he asked urgently.

“Queen Elisabeth?”

I nodded briefly. The Queen Elisabeth Competition was one of the three major competitions globally and was recognized as a national event in Belgium.

It was so famous that it was broadcast on national TV, so there was no way a Belgian would not know about the Concours. The officer’s attitude changed immediately.

[HYUN]

As I pulled my suitcase and walked out of the gate, I saw a placard with my name on it. Holding it was a typical Eastern European beauty. And next to her.

‘Is he the driver?’

With short sporty hair, raised eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and a hooked nose, he gave off a nasty impression.

No matter. Judging people by their appearance wasn’t right. I had learned that firsthand during my years in the prosecution.

“Hello, I’m Hyun.”

“Oh, I’ve been looking forward to meeting you. I’m Eva from the Queen Elisabeth planning team.”

I greeted Eva in English, then glanced at the driver. The driver still looked displeased, his face sour. It seemed that was just his usual expression. But he didn’t even take my suitcase.

“Hyun, are you unfamiliar with violinists?”

Eva asked, looking nervous.

Violinists? There were many famous ones globally, but how could I know them all? In my past life, I only cared about a few I liked.

At that moment.

“What an arrogant kid.”

The driver clearly said that in Russian. My head snapped around, but the driver seemed to think I didn’t understand.

Damn, is this racism? At times like this, one shouldn’t back down, even if my Russian was clumsy.

“What did you say, old man?”

What?

Alexei’s eyebrows shot up.

“Is that person going even though the kid didn’t want them to?”

Pierre Garnell, the great master from France, narrowed his eyes. He was displeased. Drawing lots was fine, but the chosen person had never shown any interest in the kid before, only ever complaining.

“He said he needs to see for himself how arrogant the kid is.”

At Deng Lun’s words, the other masters sighed in frustration. If anyone else had said such a thing, they wouldn’t have believed it, but with Alexei, it somehow seemed believable.

He was known for being straightforward among sensitive musicians. His direct speech was well-known through various media.

“We should stop by here.”

At Pierre’s words, the other masters all nodded.

The reason they visited the Bozar was simple. It was the hall where the competition would be held and was closest to the hotel where the kid was staying.

They had already subtly informed Eva.

“They’re here.”

At Deng Lun’s words, all the masters’ eyes focused on the window.

Eva was leading Alexei and Hyun, sweating profusely. The cold air between them was more chilling than the north wind of Moscow.

Of course, Hyun didn’t seem to know that Alexei was a violinist and a judge. Alexei wasn’t the type to introduce himself.

“Hyun, let’s take a look inside. You can visit the concert hall before the competition.”

Having slept enough on the plane, I had no problem with jet lag. It wouldn’t be bad to check out the concert hall before the competition. But why is this guy still following?

He wasn’t the driver. If so, he must be an employee of the Queen Elisabeth, just like Eva. Given the way he occasionally glared at me as if he wanted to eat me alive, I didn’t want to talk to him.

His face was still scrunched up, showing his displeasure. But what can I do? I didn’t care and kept walking.

Bozar, evaluated as one of the major European halls along with Carnegie Hall and Concertgebouw.

The spacious seating for thousands, the grand and antique interior—it was all captivating. Moreover, the moonlight streaming through the windows, combined with the red curtains, created a mysterious atmosphere.

“A violinist should naturally draw their bow when they come to Bozar.”

The driver, no, the grumpy Russian, picked a fight again. I was engrossed in the Bozar’s view. Without even glancing at him, I replied.

“That’s up to the person holding the bow.”

“Arrogant kid, that’s just an excuse for someone without courage.”

“Do you have to go to the bathroom just because you’re in the restroom? What nonsense are you spouting, old man?”

Eva, who didn’t understand a word of the rough conversation in Russian, looked completely flustered.

I felt like I should formally complain to the Concours about hiring a racist.

Then, my attention was drawn to some people. What were those eyes peeking through the door?
