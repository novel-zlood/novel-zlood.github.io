"Looking at the anecdotes of Paganini, there are things that make you doubt your eyes. For example, there is the miracle of the black crow. In a small town in Bologna, there is a custom of believing that crows must come on the day of the funeral for the soul of the deceased to ascend to heaven. However, it rained continuously for several days, and not even a single sparrow, let alone a crow, was seen."

Thud, thud, thud,

Just then, it started to pour outside the window.

"The bereaved family tried to call the crows by putting out rotten pork, but the smell of the rain mixed with the soil couldn't be pierced. They were devastated, fearing that their father's soul might not ascend to heaven. Then he appeared. Paganini, that is."

His dry lips quivered with excitement.

"While traveling, Paganini heard the sad news of the bereaved family and immediately played his violin on the spot. The melody, starting with largo, a broad and slow tone, pierced through the sound of the rain and resonated clearly. According to records, it was as if the heavy rain sounded like an accompaniment. Even the grieving family was so captivated by his melody that their eyes and ears were stolen."

And then,

"It is said that the crows that had disappeared without a trace appeared, so much that the dark gray sky turned black!"

Adam Wisho, the chief editor of the Gramophone, shook his head at the unbelievable story.

Anecdotes of artists are often exaggerated or fabricated. Especially in the case of Niccolò Paganini, it was even more so. No wonder there were rumors that he sold his soul to the devil. Because of that, even after his death, the church refused to bury him.

"Director, you don't really intend to use that anecdote in the script, do you?"

"Why? Do you really think those records are false, Editor?"

"What the audience wants is an unparalleled violinist who captivated great composers like Liszt, Brahms, and Mangore. They don't want a violinist who practices black magic. I'm worried it might cause a backlash among those expecting a music film."

It wasn't a wrong statement. Especially since this was the first movie being made about Niccolò Paganini. Didn't someone say that the first button must be fastened correctly?

"Editor, I don't intend to artificially set up everything in the movie. If the protagonist plays the violin and the crows fly in, that completes the scene."

An absurd story, but the director's face was filled with more confidence than ever.

"Director, it sounds as if you're saying the protagonist of this movie is Niccolò Paganini himself."

"Maybe it's not entirely wrong."

"Excuse me?"

At that moment, Jean-Pierre stood up.

"From now on, I must go and find him. The Paganini who doesn't come out of hiding."

A lingering fragrance filled the reception room.

Even in my past life, I had met people in high positions thanks to my father-in-law, who had been a three-term congressman. But meeting old-time power brokers was a first.

I never imagined that even those two were Chairman Wang's protégés.

"Although we are helping the investment companies through special loans, it won't last long, sir."

"How long do you think it will hold?"

"It will be hard to sustain for even two months."

If the investment companies collapsed, it would mean the bankruptcy of the commercial banks.

"The banks will be merged and acquired in the form of asset-liability transfers. We are considering at least ten banks on our side, sir."

"What do you plan to do with the existing heads?"

"They will likely be replaced en masse. With the media making such a fuss, if they forcibly continue their positions, the backlash will be severe. They will probably expect to lose their positions and be grateful if they don't end up in handcuffs."

There is a saying in the financial world that personnel matters are not about ability but the choice of the Blue House. Especially for bank presidents.

It was an era of rampant government-controlled finance, where a single breath from the Blue House could change the head of a bank.

In other words, the bald man in front of me was the real power controlling the lifeline of the financial industry in South Korea.

"Tell me about the future direction."

It was like receiving a presentation from a direct superior, but what was funny was the two men's active attitudes.

Anyone would think Chairman Wang was the real power behind the country. Maybe I had been naive all this time.

Chairman Wang was truly a legend, known even in later years. No wonder Son Ilsung feared his elderly father.

"Daehan Steel is just the beginning. Although we are buying time through debt rescheduling agreements and conciliations, we believe we won't be able to prevent a chain of bankruptcies. The same goes for large companies. The debt ratio of large companies has already exceeded 450% at this point. It's safe to say they are already in default."

Chairman Wang glanced at me slightly. It was probably because of what I had mentioned earlier.

"From now on, Hyun, you speak."

At Chairman Wang's words, all eyes turned to me. Especially the two protégés looked at me curiously. It must have been strange for them to see a kid in such a meeting, let alone being asked a question by Chairman Wang.

"In the end, they won't be able to solve it on their own."

At my firm answer, the bald man opened his eyes wide. "What's next?"

"Since they can't solve it themselves, they will have no choice but to seek help."

"Is there no way to stand up without receiving help?"

"It's not a problem caused by external factors, as the newspapers say. The reality is that the problem arose because the inside was rotten. How can you stand up when your limbs have already been cut off? Moreover, the government will be busy hiding the fact that they are receiving help from the public."

Not only the two men, but even Director Im Hyera showed a look of surprise on her face. Only the grandfather who had heard the story from me before and Chairman Wang nodded their heads.

"Why do you think the government will go to such lengths?"

The official reason would be to prevent public confusion, but the reality was simple. The backlash would be enormous.

If they were to receive bailout funds, the accompanying conditions were too clear.

A large-scale restructuring aimed at labor market flexibility would be inevitable, the gap between the rich and poor would widen day by day, and high-interest rates would emerge.

To put it simply, in one word, it was because the people would suffer.

"Because the people will suffer."

At that moment, the economic advisor of the Blue House and the governor of the Bank of Korea looked at me with eyes full of shock, as if they were asking who on earth I was.

Gulp, gulp,

The golden carp in the pond had grown plump from eating so well. Even when people approached, they would rush to the surface, thinking they were being fed.

"These guys forget in the blink of an eye no matter when they eat. They must be that stupid."

Chairman Wang had approached my side at some point and was looking down at the swimming carp.

"Hyun, humans aren't much different. Remember the gentlemen we met earlier? They love receiving something more than anyone else. Endless greed, once it becomes a habit, it becomes a person's nature."

The autumn wind blew, causing ripples on the water's surface. Only then did the golden carp lower their heads back to the bottom of the water.

"I'm very curious about which side your nature will lean towards."

What was he talking about?

"Watching you play the violin, it seems you have a lot of ambition for music, but at other times you act like an enlightened old man who has let go of everything. In a chaotic time like now, some will call it a crisis, and others will call it an opportunity. What about you, Hyun?"

It meant nothing to me. Unlike my past life, in this life, I had long lost my desire for power and material wealth.

Moreover, I had risen to the position of deputy head of the legal team handling the corruption of the Jeil Group and even prepared to become a congressman. I could list countless ways to make money even now.

Despite this, I had no desire to make money. But Chairman Wang seemed dissatisfied with that.

"When you become an adult and such a situation arises again, I hope you will take an active stance. It's worse than incompetence for a capable person to stand by without reason. Only then can I rest easy and entrust Yooha to you."

Why was the conversation steering in that direction again?

At that moment, Chairman Wang's eyes, which had been speaking like a joke, changed. It was as if he was trying to read my whole mind.

"Hyun, remember that money has neither good nor evil."

It was the first piece of advice Chairman Wang gave me.

Writing sheet music always dispelled all thoughts.

The notes on the staff seemed to come alive one by one.

When the fermata was written on the double bar line, and a piece of sheet music was finally completed, an incomparable thrill ran through my body.

It was a genuine sense of accomplishment I had never felt in my past life when I pursued success.

"Hyun, it looks like the sheet music is finally done, right?"

"Oh, I'm sorry, Director."

When I went to the studio early in the morning, there was already a visitor. It was Director Jean-Pierre.

Wasn't he the one who flew from France for me? Moreover, knowing that I still had sheet music to work on, he let me finish it first, considering my convenience.

"Now I understand why record labels want to work with you so much. Although I don't know much about music in-depth, watching you like this, it's no wonder anyone would be captivated. It's truly charming."

"You're flattering me, Director."

"Shall we get to the point now?"

It was about Niccolò Paganini. However, there were parts of the script that made me doubt my eyes.

Playing the violin to summon crows? It didn't make sense. Although he was the first virtuoso, legends tend to be embellished and exaggerated over time. There's no way Paganini actually made a deal with the devil.

"Director, isn't the part where the crows fly in when he plays the violin an exaggeration?"

"Do you really think so? I didn't expect even you to say that, Hyun."

He seemed serious.

From my experience filming "La Vie en Rose," I knew that once Jean-Pierre got hooked on something strange, his stubbornness was no joke.

What to do. In the movie "Paganini" that I saw in my previous life, there were no such scenes. Could this be another butterfly effect?

At that moment, Jean-Pierre made an absurd proposal.

"Then why don't you try playing? It's been a while since I heard you play Caprice. Of course, I'd prefer it to be in an open place, not the studio. Please."

"You don't really think crows will fly in if I play, do you, Director?"

It was a half-joking, half-serious remark, but Jean-Pierre nodded as if he had been waiting. I barely suppressed a laugh and picked up my practice violin.

The rooftop of the gallery, where a cool breeze blew, was open and made me feel like I was standing in the middle of a vast plain.

Zing.

I raised my bow, with the wind at my back. The melody resonated toward the sky in no time.

Paganini Caprice No. 24.

Wasn't it the piece I played until my hands bled at the Seoul Arts Center? After a long time, my fingers moved relentlessly, almost screaming.

But the melody was sharper and more accurate than ever.

"Is that enough?"

Swallowing the breath that was about to choke me, I looked at Jean-Pierre.

In the clear blue sky, there wasn't a single bird, not even a dragonfly enjoying the end of summer.

Of course, I'm not the Pied Piper. Paganini's anecdote must have been exaggerated over time.

Even so, Jean-Pierre's face showed signs of disappointment.

"Let's go down, Director."

I had to hurry back to the studio. If given more time, he might ask me to add another piece.

Come to think of it, Dr. Tikhonov and Director Jean-Pierre both seemed like eccentrics, just like other geniuses.

Click.

The rooftop door closed, and as the sound of the two people's footsteps faded away.

Flutter, flutter,

A bird of unknown name landed where Hyun had just stood.
