[Document(page_content='“If you look at the anecdotes of Paganini, there are things that make you doubt your eyes. For example, there's the miracle of the black crow. In a small town in Bologna, there is a custom of believing that crows must come on the day of the funeral for the soul of the deceased to ascend to heaven. However, that day it rained for several days, and not a single crow, let alone a sparrow, was seen.”\nTap, tap, tap,\nAt that moment, heavy rain began to pour outside the window.\n“The bereaved family even put out rotten pork to somehow call the crows, but it couldn't overcome the smell of rain mixed with soil. They were distraught. They were worried that their father's soul wouldn't ascend to heaven as it was. Then he appeared. Paganini, that is.”\nHis dry lips quivered with excitement.\n“Paganini, who was traveling, heard the sad news of the bereaved family and immediately played the violin. The melody, which began with a largo, broad and slow tone, pierced through the sound of the rain and resonated clearly. According to records, it sounded as if the heavy rain was accompanying him. Even the bereaved family, who were engulfed in sorrow, had their eyes and ears captivated by his melody.”\nAnd then,\n“It is said that the crows, which had disappeared without a trace, appeared as if by magic. The sky was so dark it looked almost black―!”\nAdam Wishaw, the chief editor of Gramophone, shook his head at the unbelievable story.\nThe anecdotes of artists are always prone to exaggeration or fabrication. Especially in the case of Niccolò Paganini. No wonder there were rumors that he sold his soul to the devil. It was to the extent that the church refused to bury him even after his death.\n“Director, you don't intend to cite that anecdote in the script, do you?”\n“Why? Do you really think those records are false, Mr. Editor?”\n“The audience wants an unparalleled violinist who captivated great composers like Liszt, Brahms, and Mangoré. They don't want a violinist who practices black magic. I'm concerned it might alienate those who are expecting a music film.”\nHe wasn't wrong. Especially since this was the first movie being made about Niccolò Paganini. Didn't someone say that the first button must be fastened correctly?\n“Mr. Editor, I don't intend to artificially fabricate everything in the film. If the protagonist plays the violin and crows fly in, then the scene is complete.”\nA nonsensical story, but the director's face was more confident than ever.\n“Director, it sounds as if you're saying you are Niccolò Paganini himself.”\n“You might not be wrong.”\n“Pardon?”\nAt that moment, Jean-Pierre stood up from his seat.\n“I have to go find him now. The Paganini who is hiding so well that he won't come out.”\n** *\nThe drawing room had a lingering scent.\nIn my past life, I met people in high positions thanks to my father-in-law, who was a three-term congressman. But this was my first time meeting the power brokers of the old era.\nWho would have thought that even those two people were Chairman Wang's protégés.\n“We're helping the finance company through special loans, but it won't last long. Sir.”\n“How long do you think it will hold?”\n“It will be difficult to hold out for even two months.”\nIf the finance company collapses, it means the commercial banks will go bankrupt as well.\n“The banks will be merged through asset and liability transfers. We are currently considering at least ten banks. Sir.”\n“What will you do with the current heads?”\n“They will probably be replaced en masse. The media is making a fuss, so if we proceed with their appointments, the backlash will be immense. They will expect to lose their jobs. They will be grateful they aren't put in handcuffs.”\nIn the financial sector, personnel appointments are said to be not about ability but about the choice of the Blue House. Especially the bank heads.\nIn an era of rampant government-controlled finance, it was common for the bank representatives to be changed by the breath of the Blue House.\nIn short, the bald-headed man in front of me was the real power holding the lifeline of Korea's financial sector.\n“Tell me your future direction.”\nIt was as if he was receiving a presentation from a subordinate. The funny thing was the active attitude of the two people.\nAnyone would think that Chairman Wang was the real power holder of this country. Maybe I had been oblivious all this time.\nChairman Wang was truly a legendary figure, even in later years. No wonder Son Ilsung, the president, feared his elderly father.\n“Korea Steel is just the beginning. Although we are buying time through the debt postponement agreement and reconciliation, we believe that we will ultimately fail to prevent mass bankruptcies. The same goes for large corporations. Their debt ratio has exceeded 450% at this point. It would not be an exaggeration to say they have already fallen into default.”\nAt that moment, Chairman Wang looked at me slyly. It was probably because of what I had said before.\n“Hyun, you speak from now on.”\nAll eyes were on me at Chairman Wang's words. Especially the two protégés were looking at me with curiosity. It was already strange for a kid to attend such a meeting, and now Chairman Wang was asking me questions, leaving them confused.\n“In the end, they won't be able to solve it on their own.”\nAt my resolute answer, the bald-headed man opened his eyes wide. “What next?”\n“Since they can't solve it on their own, they will have to seek help.” “Is there no way to rise without receiving help?”\n“The issue did not arise externally as the newspapers suggest. The reality is that it stemmed from internal decay. How can they rise when their limbs have already been cut off? Moreover, the government will be busy hiding the fact that they are seeking help from the public.”\nNot only the two men but also Director Im Hyera looked surprised. Only my grandfather and Chairman Wang, who had heard my story before, were nodding their heads.\n“Why do you think the government will go to such lengths?”\nIt would be under the pretext of not causing confusion among the public, but the reality was simple. The aftermath would be no joke.\nIf they receive financial aid, the accompanying conditions are very clear.\nThere will be large-scale restructuring aimed at labor market flexibility, the gap between rich and poor will widen daily, and high-interest rates will emerge.\nIf I were to summarize this simply in one sentence, it would be that ultimately,\n“The public will have to bear the brunt of it.”\nAt that moment, the economic advisor of the Blue House and the governor of the Bank of Korea looked at me with eyes filled with astonishment, as if asking who on earth I was.\n** *\nBlub, blub―!\nThe golden carp in the pond had grown plump, having eaten well. They flocked to the water surface as soon as a person approached, thinking they would be fed.\n“These guys forget in the blink of an eye no matter when they eat. They must be that stupid.”\nChairman Wang had approached and was looking down at the swimming carp.\n“Hyun, in some ways, humans are no different. The men we met earlier, they like receiving something more than anyone else. Endless greed, when it becomes a habit, becomes that person's nature.”\nThe autumn breeze created gentle ripples on the water surface. Only then did the golden carp lower their heads back to the bottom of the water.\n“I am very curious about what your nature will be, Hyun.”\nWhat was he talking about now?\n“When you play the violin, it seems like you have a lot of greed for music, but at other times you act like an old man who has renounced everything. During unsettled times like now, some will say it's a crisis while others will say it's an opportunity. What about you, Hyun?”\nIt meant nothing to me. Unlike my past life, in this life, I had long lost my desire for power and material wealth.\nMoreover, I had risen to the position of deputy head of the legal team handling the corruption of the Jeil Group and even prepared to become a congressman. I could write down countless methods to make money.\nDespite this, I had no particular desire to make money. But it seemed Chairman Wang did not like that.\n“When you become an adult and if such things happen again, I hope you will take an active stance. For a capable person to stand by without reason is worse than incompetence. So that I can rest easy and entrust Yooha to you, don't you think?”\nWhy was the conversation heading in that direction again?\nAt that moment, Chairman Wang's gaze, which had been speaking jokingly, changed. It was as if he was trying to read everything inside me.\n“Hyun, remember that money itself is neither good nor evil.”\nIt was the first piece of advice Chairman Wang gave me.\n** *\nWriting sheet music always clears all thoughts.\nIt feels as if the notes on the staff are coming to life one by one.\nWhen a fermata is placed on the double bar line and a piece of sheet music is finally completed, an incomparable sense of joy courses through my body.\nA true sense of accomplishment I had never felt in my previous life, which chased success.\n“Hyun, it seems the sheet music is finally complete?”\n“Oh, I'm sorry, Director.”\nWhen I visited the studio early in the morning, there was already a guest. It was Director Jean-Pierre.\nHadn't he flown from France just for me? Moreover, knowing that I had sheet music left to work on, he even accommodated me by letting me finish it first.\n“I can see why record labels are so eager to work with you. I'm not deeply knowledgeable about music, but when I see you like this, I understand why anyone would be captivated. It's truly charming.”\n“You flatter me, Director.”\n“Then shall we get to the main point?”\nIt was about Niccolò Paganini. However, there were contents in the script that made me doubt my eyes.\nPlaying the violin to summon crows? That makes no sense. Although he was the first virtuoso, legends tend to get embellished and exaggerated over time. There's no way Paganini really made a pact with the devil.\n“Director, isn't the part where playing the violin summons a flock of crows an exaggeration?”\n“Do you really think so? I didn't expect even you to say that, Hyun.”\nHe seemed sincere.\nFrom my experience shooting La Vie en Rose, I knew Jean-Pierre had an incredible stubbornness when fixated on something peculiar.\nWhat should I do? I remember that in the movie about Paganini I saw in my past life, there was no such scene. Could this also be a butterfly effect?\nIt was then that Jean-Pierre made an absurd suggestion.\n“Then why don't you try performing it, Hyun? I would love to hear you play Caprice after a long time. Of course, I would prefer it to be in an open space rather than the studio. Please.”\n“You don't think crows will come if I play, do you? Director.”\nIt was a joke mixed with a bit of truth, but Jean-Pierre nodded as if he had been waiting for it. I barely held back a laugh and picked up the practice violin.\nThe rooftop of the gallery, with a cool breeze blowing, was so open that it felt like standing in the middle of a vast plain.\nSqueak.\nI raised my bow against the wind. The melody began to resonate towards the sky in no time.\nPaganini Caprice No. 24.\nWasn't this the piece I played until my hands bled at the Seoul Arts Center? After a long time, my fingers moved so swiftly they seemed to scream.\nBut the melody was sharper and more precise than ever.\n“Is it good?”\nI swallowed the breath that had risen to my chin and looked at Jean-Pierre.\nIn the clear sky without a single cloud, there was not a single bird, let alone a dragonfly enjoying the end of summer.\nOf course, I'm not the Pied Piper. The tales of Paganini must have been exaggerated.\nEven so, Jean-Pierre's face showed signs of disappointment.\n“Shall we go down, Director?”\nI had to hurry back to the studio. If I gave him a little more time, he might ask me to add another piece.\nCome to think of it, Dr. Tikhonov and Director Jean-Pierre, all the great geniuses seemed to be eccentrics.\nClack.\nAs the rooftop door closed and the sound of the two people's footsteps faded away. Flap, flap―!\nA nameless bird landed where I had just been standing.\n', metadata={'source': 'source/83.txt'})]
