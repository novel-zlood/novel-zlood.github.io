“Ms. Hirose is coming to Korea?”

It was a surprising story. Hirose, often called the Queen of Hyun, had announced that she would take a sabbatical after finishing her tour in Japan. But suddenly, she was coming to Korea, which felt quite peculiar.

“Hirose’s management hasn’t made any special announcement. They’re just saying it’s a personal trip. But doesn’t it feel a bit strange?”

Reporter Kim Saetbyeol nodded in agreement with the editor-in-chief.

Hirose always went to Europe during her sabbaticals. Talking with European maestros was her only joy.

Moreover, she had no significant connections in Korea. Ah, there was one person!

“Editor, could it be because of Kang Hyun’s upcoming solo concert?”

“A solo concert?”

“She might have come to collaborate.”

The editor-in-chief frowned. It was rare for a maestro like Hirose to travel to another country for a collaboration, especially for another violinist’s solo concert. Therefore, Saetbyeol’s suggestion was entirely wrong.

“I asked Kang Hyun’s agency, but they said there was no such thing. They assured me there would be no special collaborations with another violinist in this solo concert.”

Kim Saetbyeol, looking dejected, suddenly lifted her head.

“Editor, what if Ms. Hirose is coming to propose a collaboration to Kang Hyun?”

“What do you mean?”

The editor-in-chief’s face wrinkled. It was an absurd idea. Hirose personally proposing a collaboration would be as rare as plucking a star from the sky. However, Kim Saetbyeol’s voice was resolute.

“I’m certain.”

Kim Saetbyeol’s eyes blazed with conviction like a detective.

In the past few years, the Korean classical music scene had seen many changes. From the promising pianist Baek Junghoon turning to conducting, to a Korean performing for the first time at the British Royal Court, many things had happened.

Moreover, Gramophone had remarkably declared a violinist’s first album as the record of the century.

There was one person at the center of all these events: Kang Hyun.

Buzz buzz buzz—

At the end of summer, cicadas were giving their all in their final cries.

New scores were scattered around the studio. Thinking of Son Yooha, who had returned to America, musical notes freely flowed onto the staff lines. It was like an inexhaustible well of musical ideas.

He was in the middle of creating the repertoire for his solo concert.

Knock knock.

With the sound of a knock, an unexpected person visited the studio.

Beneath her snowy white hair, her piercing eyes and red lipstick seemed to define her identity.

It was the visit of the violinist maestro, often called the Queen of Hyun.

“Ms. Hirose?”

“Hyun, it’s been a long time.”

The two were conversing comfortably in Japanese.

Hirose was surprised to see how much taller I had grown.

Looking back, the last time Hirose saw me, I was only up to her shoulder. But now, I had grown so much that I could look down at her head, which must have felt strange to her.

“Hyun, I heard you’re having a solo concert?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

The news had already reached Japan even though there hadn’t been an official announcement yet. Seeing me nod, Hirose’s face lit up with a smile.

“I thought you would temporarily set aside the violin to walk the path of a conductor. I never imagined I’d see you in a solo concert again.”

“I have no intention of giving up either the path of a conductor or a violinist.”

“As expected of Hyun.”

Hirose carefully examined my hand, likely wanting to see the effort I’d put in.

I hadn’t neglected practicing the violin alongside conducting over the past few years.

The once smooth palms now bore the honorable blisters of a seasoned veteran, proof of my dedication.

“Amazing. You didn’t disappoint me. Hyun, what are those?”

“Ah, they are scores. They’re all the pieces I’ve composed.”

“All of those scores?”

Hirose’s eyes widened. It was a common reaction from anyone visiting my studio for the first time. They couldn’t help but be amazed at the mountain of scores.

Hirose licked her dry lips, a natural reaction for any musician.

“You can look at them, ma’am.”

“Really?”

Hirose examined the scores with childlike curiosity and excitement in her eyes.

Her hands and eyes were intense as she flipped through each page, almost as if she were performing a violin piece.

How much time had passed? After going through several pieces, Hirose let out a breath she had been holding.

“Hyun, you’re truly amazing.”

Even though the pieces were untitled and only numbered, their content was enough to captivate the maestro Hirose’s eyes.

“Your composition skills have already been proven by Gramophone, but I never imagined it to be this level. If the classical world knew you had so many compositions, they would be abuzz. You’re like Mozart. It’s hard to believe you composed so many pieces over the years.”

It was high praise. I had simply been immersed in the joy of composing over the past few years.

After a while of examining the scores, Hirose spoke.

“Hyun, would you consider collaborating with me in your upcoming solo concert?”

“You mean a collaboration with you, ma’am?”

“Yes, that’s why I came to see you. I couldn’t resist when I heard you were having a solo concert.”

How could I refuse? Listening to the Queen of Hyun’s melodies had inspired me to enter the world of classical music. As her long-time fan, performing with her was an honor.

Even if she had asked over the phone, I would have gladly accepted, but her coming all the way to Korea made it even more special.

“And I have a request.”

Hirose took out her violin case from behind her.

“I want us to play Joy and Fantasy together.”

I was speechless. That’s exactly what I had hoped for.

The two violins, Stradivarius, were originally crafted to be a pair.

Antonio Stradivari once said, “If Joy burned as hot as the blazing sun, Fantasy was as cold as the deepening darkness.”

Just thinking about the two instruments harmonizing made my heart race wildly.

“Where’s the person who plays Go?”

Chairman Wang smiled slyly at Chairman Yoo.

“The Son family has improved quite a bit.”

Chairman Yoo immediately placed a black stone on the Go board. Chairman Wang, like a hawk eyeing its prey from above, instantly recognized the black stone’s move to invade the upper-left corner.

Tak―!

The white stone made a sound as it landed on the Go board, like a gliding descent.

“Well, I’m learning from a master player. I can’t afford to lose to you. But it’s hard to beat Hyun. No matter how you look at it, that kid would have made a name in Go even if not in music or management.”

Eventually, Chairman Yoo placed the stone. The outcome was clear without even counting the points.

Chairman Yoo resolved to receive Go lessons from his grandson, Kang Hyun. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to beat Chairman Wang, who was like an old fox.

“Old man, speaking of which, the deadline is approaching. Is Hyun steadily accumulating shares?”

“You mean the bet? There are only a few months left.”

“When I checked a year ago, he was already slowly siphoning off Beomjin’s shares. You know how Beomjin became a toothless wolf after being demoted. He wouldn’t dream that VH Company is actually Hyun.”

The more one saw, the more astonishing the kid was. At the mere age of a high schooler, he easily manipulated his uncles, who were in their forties, as if playing them in the palm of his hand.

Moreover, his blueprint for investing in the IT industry intrigued even Chairman Wang.

“Oh, I made another bet with Hyun.”

“Another one?”

What kind of bet was it this time? Chairman Wang seemed to enjoy making bets with Kang Hyun as if it were a life’s pleasure.

Every time Kang Hyun accomplished an impossible bet, Chairman Wang felt a sense of catharsis.

He said he understood the minds of ancient kings who imposed impossible tasks on heroes in Greek and Roman mythology.

“I challenged him to get a perfect score on the college entrance exam this time.”

Chairman Wang showed a subtle smile. No matter how brilliant Hyun was, this seemed impossible.

Sizzle sizzle―!

From the morning, a fragrant smell filled the house in Ichon-dong.

Mother had rolled up her sleeves and was diligently preparing a lunchbox.

She was cooking brown rice and making various side dishes for me, a test-taker. She was carefully selecting side dishes that were easy to digest and not too salty.

“Mom, you can just make it as usual.”

“Son, food is important on a day like today. I was so nervous yesterday that I couldn’t sleep.”

It seemed like the family was more nervous than the person taking the college entrance exam.

Judging from my past life’s experience, today wasn’t much different from any other day.

I got into the car, receiving farewells not only from my parents but also from my grandfather.

I barely managed to dissuade them from accompanying me to the exam site before departing.

Seeing my mother praying in the rearview mirror made me feel strangely emotional.

“Kang Hyun, fighting!”

Receiving encouragement from Mr. Kim the driver, I got out of the car.

At the entrance of the exam site, not only were my juniors from Jeil High School gathered, but also the teachers and the principal. The principal gave me a heartfelt hug and cheered me on.

“Hyun, just do it as you normally do!”

My homeroom teacher’s face looked as if he were a national representative going to the Olympic finals. It seemed like everyone else was more nervous than the actual test-taker.

I could count on my fingers the number of people as calm as I was.

Even other students appeared tense. Their shoulders were stiff, almost as if they had “I’m nervous” written all over them.

“Don’t worry, I’ll do well.”

Of course, I wasn’t planning to take the exam lightly. Though I hadn’t decided which university to attend, I had made a bet with that old snake.

At first, I thought it was just a joke. But to get a perfect score on the college entrance exam, that was a task I hadn’t achieved even in my past life.

‘How many did I get wrong in my past life?’

Was it four or three? I probably got that many wrong in total.

I still vividly remembered getting a stomach ache the day before the college entrance exam in my past life. That, coupled with terrible condition, had significantly affected my performance.

The exam site was filled with an indescribable tension. It felt like witnessing soldiers just before going into battle.

For example, I was a seasoned veteran. Hadn’t I taken the college entrance exam in my past life and also the bar exam?

This level of tension was rather entertaining.

I quietly laid out the designated writing utensils on the desk and waited for the first subject.

How much time had passed? The supervising teacher announced the guidelines and distributed the first subject.

The faces of the students simultaneously twisted upon receiving the test papers. If one word could describe their feelings, it would be this.

Damn.

The Korean language section in the first period was quite challenging. It was on a level incomparable to mock exams. The students’ faces showed clear signs of confusion and panic.

But I was different. As I flipped through the pages of the test paper, I silently marveled. I had trusted my advanced intelligence, but it was truly as if the answers were visible.

Even without recalling the answers, I was confident I could solve everything, but the smoother the process, the better.

At that moment, my right hand swiftly moved towards the answers in sync with the clock’s second hand.
