Kang Hyun had become skilled enough to communicate with the members with just a glance, even without speaking.

In the quiet concert hall, not even the sound of the members' breathing could be heard, only the breath of the audience filled the space. Everyone looked expectant and excited.

As if responding to that sight, Kang Hyun's baton sharply cut through the air.

Gang Hyun Symphony No.1

Simultaneously, a majestic hymn resonated. The overture of the piece was a harmony of horns and the tremolo of strings.

A cautious melody echoed, as if engraving footprints in the snow.

As the conductor's shoulders heaved greatly,

Dudududung—!

The grand epic began. The audience couldn't hide their excitement at the heart-shaking resonance.

Even the reporters, instead of observing the situation, were drawn in, becoming one of the audience members, fully immersed in the stage.

Under Kang Hyun's direction, the orchestra, a massive instrument, played in unison.

At the end of the inescapable melody, Kang Hyun's left hand made a straight line in the air and clenched, causing the orchestra to momentarily slow down, creating gentle waves. Just as the audience swallowed their saliva in wonder at that moment,

To touch the sun, to touch the sun, like a rising illusion—!

A majestic hymn resounded from Kang Hyun's fingertips. The audience was captivated by the choir's hymn, both visually and aurally. It wasn’t aiming for the top of the Billboard charts for nothing.

‘It wasn't an exaggeration.’

One of the critics, who had never experienced Kang Hyun's conducting, admitted his mistake.

He thought he was just an excellent violinist and conductor. But what was this thrill that penetrated his entire body?

Listening to a recording and actually being part of the audience and watching the stage were worlds apart. The hymn resonating from Kang Hyun's fingertips felt like a strong stimulus, as if struck by lightning.

It wasn't just the story of one person. Even the reporters who occasionally wrote negative articles about Kang Hyun wore dumbfounded expressions, as if in a state of shock.

Moreover, today's performance had not even begun yet. Weren't there still two more symphonies composed by Kang Hyun?

In the flow of the grand melody, the audience prayed in unison. They wished that this time would never end.

"Whew—!"

A heavy breath was released. Though the performance had ended, his shoulders were still trembling. He could pride himself on having been on many stages so far, but today was the hardest day.

Antonio, the concertmaster, still couldn't tell if he had dreamed or experienced reality. The expressions of the other members were the same. That’s how enchanting the stage had been.

"Where is the maestro?"

"He stepped out briefly for a signing event."

Kang Hyun had not shown a single sign of disruption until he bowed to the audience after the performance.

Antonio felt infinite reverence towards Kang Hyun, who was much younger than him. What kind of experience and talent must one possess to display such a demeanor?

At that time, Kang Hyun couldn’t close his mouth. Thanks to the audience who visited the New York Philharmonic Concert Hall.

Not only the audience who watched the performance but also those who waited outside the concert hall until the end of the performance formed a line.

Although a signing event was scheduled, it was limited to three hundred people considering Kang Hyun's condition.

"No matter how you look at it, it seems far more than three hundred people."

The concert hall official was also at a loss for words at Kang Hyun's remark. The traffic around the concert hall was paralyzed. Even the New York police were directly managing the crowd that had flocked to the concert hall.

"Maestro, we will limit it to three hundred people."

"No."

"Pardon?"

"I’ll do as much as I can."

Undoubtedly, many people had sacrificed their time to visit the concert hall for today. Seeing the endless line of people, Kang Hyun realized his popularity and responsibility.

He even saw a little girl and her parents who had driven five hours on the highway just to attend the signing event, even though they couldn’t watch the performance.

The little girl kept shouting "Hyun!" with an excited voice. How could he send back such eyes full of excitement?

Three months had passed since the concert in New York ended. The snowflakes that had piled up on the ground melted, and new buds sprouted with the early spring energy.

Although the cherry blossoms had not yet bloomed, the campus was already filled with the energy of new students, making it feel like spring.

[German Language Department Class of 00, Kang Hyun, elevates the status of Korea University in New York!]

At the main gate of Korea University, a banner with Kang Hyun's name and photo was prominently fluttering.

Not only the current students but also the new students were mainly interested in Kang Hyun.

Right after the successful performance in New York, its impact was beyond words. The symphonies Kang Hyun announced consecutively entered the Billboard charts and even sparked a new wave of 'Hallyu'.

‘Annoying.’

However, Kang Hyun himself couldn’t handle the nuisance. He had returned to Korea from New York, but his daily life was no different from in the U.S.

Various media contacts, broadcast appearances, and CF offers poured in endlessly.

Among them, the fastest to approach was likely the Minister of Culture.

In a running car, Im Hyera, sitting in the adjacent seat, casually started the conversation.

"Hyun, going to receive the Popular Culture and Arts Award feels like...”

"Like a calf being led to the slaughterhouse?"

"No, it’s like being dragged to the dentist by your mom."

"Representative, it’s exhausting to always go and smile nicely for a photo. The people I’m meeting now don’t aim to award me but to take a picture with me. I’d rather hold a signing event for my fans during that time."

He had already experienced receiving awards from the government. Especially when he scored a perfect score on the CSAT for the first time in history, hadn’t he been summoned to the Blue House? That day, he took photos enough for a lifetime, and he smiled so much that his face cramped.

"Hyun, you sometimes seem like an old man, but at times like this, you seem like an old man who finds everything in the world annoying."

It wasn’t a wrong expression. Kang Hyun’s mental age had already far surpassed Im Hyera’s. At that moment,

"Representative, we’ve arrived."

At the driver’s words, Kang Hyun looked out the window. The Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism building was visible.

Like at Korea University, a banner with Kang Hyun’s name prominently fluttered in the spring breeze. There were even reporters sporadically seen at the entrance.

Surely, more reporters would be stationed in the main hall where the awards ceremony was being held.

Kang Hyun relaxed his facial muscles a few times, quickly erasing his annoyed look and putting on a faint smile. Im Hyera responded with a slight smile, saying, 'You’re a pro, indeed.'

"There is one vacancy on the judges' panel."

The silence among the masters didn’t last long. The first to speak was Viktor from Russia, who rubbed his nose bridge.

"I want to recommend Nikolai."

"Nikolai? Isn't he nurturing young talents at the Moscow Conservatory?"

"It just so happens that he is on sabbatical, so I’m sure he would gladly accept."

Despite Viktor’s certainty, no one readily agreed. While Nikolai wasn’t renowned as a violinist, he was quite famous as a professor nurturing young talents. However,

"Viktor, are you sure Nikolai is indeed on sabbatical?"

"Deng Lun, why do you ask?"

Deng Lun, the Chinese maestro, stroked his lips and replied.

"To my knowledge, Nikolai was forced to take a break due to severe alcohol dependence. Everyone knows he is a notorious drinker."

Viktor furrowed his brows but couldn’t deny it. Thus, Nikolai was excluded from the candidate list.

After that, numerous renowned maestros’ names were mentioned. However, they couldn’t pinpoint one person.

The reasons varied. Many renowned maestros would refuse to be on the judges' panel. They couldn’t appoint someone without the skill to the judges' seat, either.

The maestros from various countries, gathered in one place, pondered deeply.

"Viktor, how about Alexei?"

"He is impossible. He is the dean of the Moscow Conservatory and has served as a judge before. Back then, he complained a lot. If asked to be a judge again, he would probably start cursing."

It was undeniable. The other maestros, knowing Alexei’s nasty temper, didn’t argue further.

Another long silence followed. Then, Hugo, the bald maestro from France, spoke with a serious expression.

"This competition, postponed last year due to unavoidable circumstances, can’t be delayed again. If we fail to select the last judge, there will be significant backlash. Viktor, can we really trust Nikolai?"

"Of course, if I see him drinking, I will personally reprimand him."

"Hugo, this is a big mistake. I’ve heard many rumors about Nikolai. If he is appointed, I will withdraw from this position."

"Deng Lun, how can you say something so irresponsible?"

"Viktor, appointing an alcoholic is more irresponsible, I think."

The maestros’ heated debate continued. To an outsider, it might seem like elderly gentlemen arguing. In reality, these were maestros who held sway over the violin world.

At that moment, the white-haired woman who had been quietly observing tapped the table with her long fingers.

"I have a recommendation."

All eyes turned to Hirose at her statement. Known as the queen of strings, she held an absolute position in Asia as a violinist.

She was the only active performer among the maestros gathered as judges. Though not on stage, she exuded an aura as if she were.

"Hirose, who do you wish to recommend?"

The French maestro Hugo’s eyes sparkled with hope.

Hirose was someone whose violin skills were second to none in this gathering. The person she recommended was surely no ordinary individual.

With a faint smile, Hirose spoke.

"Violinist Hyun."
