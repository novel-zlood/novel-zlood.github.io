"Hohoho, this is the first time I've encountered such a case."

The next day, Hyunsoo had a meeting with the principal. He was a very stylish old gentleman. His manner of speaking was polite and his ability to grasp the key points was excellent.

"To put it simply, there are no mandatory subjects for you to take. According to the results of the level test, your education is at the high school level, and in some areas, it is at the university level."

"Hmm... I see."

'Ah, if I had known this, I would have intentionally gotten some answers wrong.'

Initially, he started solving the test without much thought, but as it got more interesting, he immersed himself in it, leading to this situation.

Seeing Hyunsoo's expression darken despite being praised, the principal found it intriguing and emphasized his point again.

"If you want, I can let you graduate with top honors right away. I can also write a recommendation letter for the university you intend to apply to. Although you might need to supplement some extracurricular activities important for college admissions, your academic level is more than sufficient."

"...Ah. No, there's no need for that."

"Hoho, this is also a first for me. You don't seem very pleased with my proposal. Is there a particular reason?"

"A reason? I just want to experience a normal high school life. I was thinking of finding a hobby or skill outside of studying."

The principal observed Hyunsoo's expression carefully and then spoke.

"A normal high school life... That's an intriguing statement. Can I ask what you mean by a normal high school life? Most of our students aim to build the best credentials to get into prestigious universities, but it seems like you mean something different."

Hyunsoo answered honestly.

"I don't know what I want to do yet, so I plan to find out slowly while attending school."

"That's a very good goal. In fact, many students often miss what's important while trying to meet societal expectations. So, can I understand that you are willing to forego academic achievements to continue your school life?"

"Yes. I'm not attending school just for the depth of academic learning."

The principal smiled with satisfaction and asked.

"Then how about this? Have you heard of the 'free classes' allowed for upperclassman elites?"

"Of course."

Hyunsoo's perfect memory ensured that he would not forget the 'free classes' of Johannes High School.

'The decisive factor for our family's decision to study abroad was the free classes.'

In the free classes, students choose the field they want to study.

It could be a commonly known subject like math or computer science, or something like running a YouTube channel or starting a startup, subjects that would typically be created in a club.

Once the subject is decided, a lesson plan must be created. The goals for learning and development in that subject over a semester must be set.

Whether to study on one's own or learn directly from someone. What textbooks and materials to use, and how many hours to invest each week. A detailed curriculum must be planned.

'Then the school provides very generous support.'

The support is so generous that elite students in the arts and sports can invite medalists or competition winners for special lectures, no matter how much budget it takes.

General elite students can audit classes directly from Nobel Prize-winning professors through a partnership with Stanford University or take lectures from other famous scholars online.

As long as it is directly related to the free class, they can rent the most expensive facilities and use any expensive art materials without limit.

Through the alumni network of Johannes High School, as long as it is feasible, the budget is no issue.

'With such benefits for each elite student in grades 3-4, it's no wonder they come to study abroad.'

For Hyunsoo, who wanted to balance academics and the arts, it was the perfect environment.

Of course, such extraordinary benefits came with great responsibility.

First, the free class lesson plan must be approved by the board of directors.

Since the majority of the strict board members must approve, most elites get their plans approved only after at least two rejections.

And a rigorous monthly evaluation.

If a student's progress is below standard, they are disqualified from the free class for that semester, so elites tend to invest more time in free classes than in regular classes.

'But it's worth the risk for such an amazing education system. It even captivated the high-nosed upper-class children in the U.S.'

So the principal's ensuing proposal was also shocking to Hyunsoo.

"I don't know how the board will react, but as the principal, I will allow you to register for three free classes this semester."

"What? There's no need to go that far..."

"No, it's absolutely necessary. No matter how much you want a normal high school life, I cannot allow education without learning. If that's what you want, you'd better consider transferring to another school instead of Johannes High School."

"What?"

Despite Hyunsoo's several refusals, the principal's will was firm.

"Our high school is difficult to get into, so it is our responsibility to provide the best environment for all students to develop. No matter how much of a genius you are, you can't say you've reached the end of learning, can you?"

Hyunsoo gave a wry smile. If he didn't accept the proposal, it would make him seem arrogant, as though he believed there was nothing more to learn.

'This works out well. Now I have a legitimate reason to receive proper support for the fields I want to explore.'

He felt like he could finally resolve some of his regrets about not being able to pursue the arts and sports due to his past physical limitations.

"Okay. Thank you for giving me this great opportunity."

"Hoho, you made a very good decision. Perhaps this is the best thing I've done since becoming the principal. I believe you can easily overcome any obstacles from the board."

"...??"

* * *

The next day, Hyunsoo realized what the principal meant.

Suddenly, a one-on-one test with teachers was scheduled.

-So you're Hyunsoo. I've heard a lot about you from the principal.

Although the theoretical level was assessed through the level test, the board seemed to feel the need to reverify Hyunsoo's eligibility for the free classes.

The teachers, determined to dig deep into Hyunsoo's abilities, bombarded him with questions and solved problems together, conducting various forms of pressure tests.

'Are they trying to find any fault to disqualify me?'

'Three free classes are indeed too much. How much budget are they pouring into one student?'

'He might be worth it, but... does he really have that much value?'

The three teachers involved in the test were board members and tested Hyunsoo with a rather sharp attitude.

Surprisingly, the test ended in a very amicable atmosphere.

-You're truly a genius. To read so quickly and grasp the key points? And in English literature, which isn't even your native language? You have a talent for writing. How about publishing a book? I'll personally be your editor.

-How about becoming a mathematician? The world is essentially driven by math. I think it's time for you to lead it.

-Did the math teacher say that? Tsk tsk, you should use math as a foundation for pure science. Science is the true force that changes the world. Isn't everything humanity has achieved due to scientific revolutions? Let's walk the path of science together.

No matter how prestigious the teachers were, none had studied as deeply as Hyunsoo in their respective fields. When he quoted dozens of pages from professional books without a single error, the teachers were astonished.

'It's not just his memory; his mind seems exceptionally sharp.'

Anyway, after many twists and turns, Hyunsoo was granted the qualification to register for three free classes and given a two-week deadline to get the lesson plans approved by the board.

* * *

"...So you skipped to the third year? And got permission for three free classes?!"

Jessi looked dizzy after seeing Hyunsoo's updated profile. He casually replied.

"They said they could let me graduate if I wanted, but I declined because I don't want to go to university yet."

"What?"

Jessi had every reason to be shocked. Although there had been cases of students skipping grades since the founding of Johannes High School, there were only a handful of cases where a student skipped a grade based solely on a level test.

And graduating based on a level test? That too, for a student who transferred from abroad???

"I can't decide whether it's more shocking that you got a perfect score on the level test or that our high school would let you graduate based on it."

Jessi gave up trying to understand. Although she had only known Hyunsoo for a day, he was beyond her grasp.

"No, the most unbelievable part is getting three free classes in one semester?!"

"If you think about it, isn't it just two free classes? Physical education is mandatory for all students anyway."

"But physical education as a free class is different. Although you have to participate in group classes, if you create a good lesson plan, you can share the professional training facilities used by the athletic teams. Even Olympic athletes use those facilities... And if you want, you can get guidance from the school coach or invite external experts. Wow... I'm so jealous."

Seeing Jessi, who was unusually excited, Hyunsoo squinted his eyes.

"What's this? Why are you so interested in getting me to exercise? Is it one of your mentoring duties to help me develop?"

"..."

"Is it? Hehe, I guess I'll just give up on physical education this semester."

"...Sorry. I was too overbearing, wasn't I? Do whatever you want. Physical education is surprisingly fun?"

Hyunsoo thought about teasing her more but decided to let it go, feeling like he was bullying a child.

"If it's fun, I'll give it a try. Which group classes should I take?"

"Good decision. For 3rd and 4th years, you can choose either the morning or afternoon class. Since you have no overlapping classes, you can take whichever you prefer."

"Really? Then sign me up for the morning class."

"Okay. Done."

Jessi led Hyunsoo with a meaningful look in her eyes.

"Then let's go right now. The morning class starts in 20 minutes."

"What? You're in this class too?"

"Why? Don't like it?"

"No... It's just that your overly cheerful face makes me uneasy. It looks like the face of a villain setting a trap in a movie."

"Ha. Ha. Very funny. I'm just excited to take care of you in class as your mentor."

"...??"

Hyunsoo looked even more confused but had no choice but to follow.

'He's been so quick to catch on since earlier.'

Jessi sighed in relief when they finally reached the gym where the physical education class was held. Hyunsoo obediently went to change his clothes.

'Though I got embarrassed in academics, physical education will be different.'

* * *

"Everyone, gather around after a simple warm-up."

The physical education teacher, called the coach, was a woman in her 30s with a South American background.

"As you know, we'll be focusing on basketball for the first quarter this semester. We'll have a theoretical exam at the end of the quarter, and for the practical, each of you will need to master three shots of your choice and one desired position. Finally, there will be a team game. If you want to check the grade cutoffs, come see me individually."

She then pointed to the eight basketball courts in the gym.

"We're not in elementary school, so just practice your shots, and I'll come around to check your form. There are many skilled students here, so help each other out. After 25 minutes of shot practice, you can either play a game or practice individually for the remaining 25 minutes. But if I see anyone just sitting around or on their phone, I'll deduct points for attitude."

As soon as the coach finished speaking, the students dispersed on their own.

'It's a very free atmosphere.'

Hyunsoo also grabbed a basketball and looked for a court.

The morning physical education class had 30 upperclassmen (3rd and 4th years), most of whom were chatting with their friends while shooting casually.

Hyunsoo found an empty court.

"Do you play basketball?"

Jessi, now in sporty attire with her blonde hair tied back, asked.

"No, I've never played before."

"Basketball isn't that popular in Korea?"

"Hmm... Not really, but I was more into soccer. You seem unusually happy when I say I haven't played."

Jessi quickly wiped the smile off her face.

"I'm naturally cheerful. Anyway, let me give you some pointers. Try shooting once. Do you need me to demonstrate?"

Swish-

Even to Hyunsoo, a novice, her shooting form looked clean as she made a mid-range shot.

Jessi looked back with a slightly smug expression.

"Got the hang of it? Or should I show you a few more times?"

"It's fine. It looks easy enough."

"Hey. It looks easy, but it's really hard when you first try..."

She was about to give more advice but stopped when she saw Hyunsoo confidently preparing to shoot.

'Didn't they say he has terrible athletic skills?'

Jessi secretly hoped his shot would fail, ideally in a way that would be amusing, as is often the case with those who are bad at sports.

"What?"

However, her expression soon hardened.

'This isn't right?!'
