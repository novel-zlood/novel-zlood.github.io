Adriana felt confused as she looked at the titles of the books Hyunsoo was reading and stacking next to him.

“<Human Body and Ergonomics>, <Artificial Organs and the Skeleton of the Human Body>, <The Most Human-like Artificial Body>?? Do they teach this kind of stuff in high school?”

Just reading a little bit of the text gave her a headache.

There were more technical terms than familiar words, making it seem suitable for treating insomnia.

“Oh, it's not part of the regular curriculum. It's just a field I'm interested in, so I study it in my spare time.”

Adriana widened her eyes and asked again.

“Aren't you going to major in fashion or art? This looks like some hardcore engineering books even for STEM students.”

“I haven't decided on my major yet... But this is something I must do, like a life's mission, if that makes sense?”

In reality, he slept less at night and studied medical and bioengineering, his fields of expertise from the past, whenever he had time.

“Ugh. Studying something like this out of obligation sounds too harsh.”

“I do it because I like it. I owe a really big debt.”

“I can't even imagine what kind of debt that could be.”

Since he couldn't explain it, Hyunsoo just gave a faint smile.

‘If I have returned to the past thanks to my previous life, shouldn't I at least achieve as much as I did in my past life?’

While the clear cause of his return was unknown, he had a vague feeling about it.

So, he studied diligently.

Thanks to his perfect memory, he was already maintaining the level of his past, but there was another reason he was studying contemporary academic knowledge.

‘The time we established the company and started full-scale activities was 10 years later. All the achievements of our company were built on the roads paved by others over these 10 years.’

Currently, it's 2020. The company was founded in 2030 by raising funds.

In the decade-long period during which even mountains and rivers change, medical engineering made remarkable advancements in all fields.

...And Hyunsoo had no contribution to the significant growth achieved during at least this period.

Currently, other companies were working hard on actual research and development, and Hyunsoo's company acquired and utilized only the core technologies through mergers and acquisitions 10 years later.

‘Even if no one knows, taking that and monopolizing it ahead of time feels like stealing.’

It was no different from copying a future best-seller and publishing it under his own name.

But it was not a situation where he could wait another 10 years just to witness the advancements in medical and bioengineering as he did in the past.

‘Then the significance of my return would fade.’

Shouldn't there be some improvements compared to the first round if it's the second round?

Hyunsoo had to make a sort of compromise.

- Free technology disclosure on HUB.

He decided to gradually disclose the most critical academic achievements that would be realized over the next 10 years.

‘As a result, it created an environment where interested developers and scholars could easily access it, communicate smoothly, and conduct joint research.’

In many ways, it was an encouraging development. Although he couldn't avoid feeling like a thief, he had at least a minimal justification to pardon himself.

The technology development that would have taken 10 years if he hadn't intervened was reduced by 3 to 4 years.

‘And as the number of competitive suppliers increased, the groundwork was laid for consumers to use better products at slightly lower prices.’

Hyunsoo's duty ultimately lay with the consumers. It was enough if it could help them, rather than for personal gain.

“...”

Hyunsoo was once again deeply engrossed in reading.

[Medical engineers are broadly divided into two categories. Those who prioritize the development of new materials closest to human skin and muscle tissue, and those who believe that a much deeper understanding of the human body is necessary first...]

As soon as he read a sentence, he was quickly cut off from the world.

The scenery of the living room was no longer visible.

In his own world, a knowledge system was formed based on the content of the book.

If visualized, it was similar to a tree.

[Hydroxyapatite, the most commonly used biomaterial for human implants, currently utilizes various deposition technologies such as plasma spray, but has not yet overcome the limitation of nanoscale structures due to technological constraints.]

The related knowledge he read was absorbed through the roots as nutrients.

Depending on the quality of reading, the leaves became more abundant, and the branches grew sturdier. The more he studied, the more the tree grew.

‘Is this what it feels like to do drugs?’

When the somewhat vague concepts he had were gradually supplied with water and sunlight to achieve true “growth,” the intellectual pleasure that came with it was indescribable.

“...”

Hyunsoo’s immersion was rarely broken except when he ate meals with his mom and Adriana.

Especially on weekends, there was nothing else to distract him, so he spent half the day sitting quietly, reading and constantly reflecting.

He also kept up with the latest research papers. They contained various research results that brought new insights.

‘Shall I start organizing now?’

Late on Sunday evening, Hyunsoo turned on his laptop and accessed HUB.

[Challenging the Realm of the Gods. III]

Combining the content he had studied so far and the knowledge of the future... a plausible vision came to mind.

After briefly organizing his thoughts, he quickly composed an article.

‘It seems like writing is becoming easier?’

He thought writing was the most refined form of language.

The process of organizing abstract concepts in his mind and writing them so that others could easily understand was difficult yet rewarding.

At first, he wrote with many revisions, but by the time he reached the third part, the writing came out much more naturally.

‘Done.’

Hyunsoo uploaded the completed post as it was.

With that, the [Challenging the Realm of the Gods] series was completed.

While it didn't contain all the knowledge and technology accumulated over the next 10 years, it provided the most ideal framework in Hyunsoo's opinion.

Adding flesh and blood to it was each individual's domain.

During the remaining time, he reviewed the progress of joint research documented on HUB and provided detailed comments where supplementation was needed.

‘It’s been reduced to roughly 5 years.’

Although it was an estimate, it seemed that the 10 years of achievement had been roughly halved to about 5 years.

He had done his part. Now it was time to wait.

‘Is it time to start gathering my former business partners from the past?’

Lying in bed, Hyunsoo carefully organized his plans for the future.

Early the next morning.

“Are you ready?”

“Yeah...”

Hyunsoo and Adriana headed to the airport by car.

It was the day she left for New York for PIT classes.

She usually chatted non-stop about things like, ‘There’s this really nasty director at RR who keeps criticizing our designs...’ or ‘Last time, a super handsome model came to the company for work. He wouldn’t stop hitting on me, asking for my number.’

But today, for some reason, she was quiet.

It was only when they arrived at the airport and started unloading her luggage that she complained.

“It's unfair.”

“Hm?”

Her already plump lower lip pouted even more.

“Of course, I was super busy with work too, but I stayed here all weekend. In a place with no friends, wasting a golden weekend...”

“You’re amazing. I always feel it, but Adriana, your passion for work is incredible. It's impressive.”

“That’s not what I wanted you to acknowledge!”

Hyunsoo quietly looked at Adriana's face.

‘Even when she's pouting, she's pretty.’

How could a person's features be as beautiful as a doll's?

Her violet eyes, which now seemed almost patented, sparkled like jewels, perhaps from wearing colored lenses again.

“You were home for four days... Even if you're busy, you could have spent a little time hanging out with me.”

“Oh, I'm sorry.”

Hyunsoo couldn't help but laugh at her reproachful look.

“Why are you laughing? I'm being fair because you're a high school student... If I decide to go for it, everything will be over before you know it. Got it?”

Even though she was four years older than him, how could she threaten so cutely?

Hyunsoo just blurted it out.

“Then let's go on a date next time we meet.”

“...!”

Adriana froze for a moment but soon regained her smile, resembling a blooming flower.

“...Ah, I'll check my schedule for next week and let you know. But you have to keep your schedule open!”

She hugged Hyunsoo tightly and left with a light step.

Then, as if she remembered something, she turned around and said,

“Oh, and since you'll end up marrying me anyway, go ahead and meet other girls. According to your mom, you’re still single, right? You need a point of comparison to know whether what you have is a gem or a rock.”

“...”

Hyunsoo was too stunned to react to the shocking words she had just said.

Adriana, full of confidence, drove the nail in further.

“You'll understand once you experience it. Software can be updated with time, but inherent hardware can't be matched even with tuning.”

With that, she left.

“...”

On the way back home, Hyunsoo pondered the meaning of her words.

The conclusion came quickly.

‘It's easier to understand specialized books. Love is still a long way to go, Hyunsoo.’

Vrrrrrr-

[Jesse Goldstein: The only time that works for everyone is 9 AM. Please come back to the student council room by then.]

Sarah had no particular thoughts when she received Jesse’s text about attending the meeting.

‘Is it a preparatory meeting?’

Since she had only discussed the music production and release with Jesse, she thought it was a meeting to share the plans and get opinions from the participants, especially Hyunsoo.

“...Oh!”

But when she attended the meeting, she was surprised.

Not only Jesse, Angela, and Hyunsoo but also the unexpected Sasha were present as the meeting started.

“Thanks for coming on time, everyone.”

Jesse handed out a copy of the project plan to everyone.

“The reason we gathered today has been explained individually, and since everyone willingly agreed, I’m handing this out. Please don't leak anything until the official release of the music.”

“Oh, Jesse, you’re so professional.”

“I’ll keep that in mind.”

Everyone nodded solemnly except for one person pretending not to hear and doing something else.

“Angela?”

“Hey, don’t you trust me?”

“No. Even if you block me on SNS, I have ways to find out, so don’t even think about it. If anything leaks, even a small detail, it’s your fault. You’ll be out immediately.”

“Yes! I’ll keep that in mind, President~.”

Only after receiving Jesse's stern look did Angela lower her tail.

“First, check the project plan. Let’s discuss after that.”

Sarah, as well as everyone else, couldn't help but be amazed by the content.

‘Is she a robot?’

Did she complete the project plan over the weekend? It meticulously detailed all the procedures and steps for music production.

But the content was too shocking.

‘What is going on?’

Sarah couldn't believe her eyes.
