Kyle sat quietly in the corner, looking utterly despondent.

"Seriously, who composes music as a critique?"

It was common for critics to show improvement points through live performances.

But composing a full score with individual parts for each instrument in just about 10 minutes?

"A musical genius?"

The piece was a perfect fit for Sarah, showcasing such overwhelming skill that any mistakes were easily overlooked.

-♫♩♫ ♪!

The high notes were so clear that Kyle couldn't help but gasp in admiration.

No one dared to properly critique Hyunsoo's "critique."

Could there ever be a more perfect critique? Hyunsoo had found the sweet spot between the music Sarah excelled at and the music she wanted to perform.

Not only did Hyunsoo compose the piece, but he also delivered a high-quality performance. How could anyone add more words to that?

Even from the start, Alberto was so critical that no proper critique could follow.

"On top of that, isn't he crossing the line by being so good at piano too?"

When Hyunsoo and Sasha's presentation started, Kyle tried his best to keep a straight face.

"I have to stay sharp to critique this."

Of course, that resolve evaporated the moment Hyunsoo and Sasha sat side by side at the piano and played together seamlessly, like a jam session.

-♫♩ ♪♫♩ ♪

They played with such synergy, sometimes powerful and other times as if they were one person.

"Wait, since when was he this good at piano? This guy isn't in the music industry?"

"He's not even inferior to Sasha? She's an extreme technician, and he can keep up with her."

"Wow, they’re going to crush this concert. They have to perform last; can you imagine the teams that have to follow them?"

Hyunsoo's group presentation turned into a performance, overshadowing any critique.

"That was the best! So amazing!"

Even the usually shy and quiet Sarah gave a thumbs-up with a flushed face.

-Hahaha, what's that? Is she praising the piece or the performer?

-Sarah looks so cute like this, doesn't she? Speaking confidently and then getting embarrassed, it's charming.

-She's always had top-tier looks. Her shyness just downplays it. She has that classic European beauty.

"..."

In such an atmosphere, what could Kyle possibly critique?

He sighed deeply and spoke whatever came to mind.

"It wasn't bad. But next time, we'll show something better."

Kyle was startled by his own words.

"What the hell did I just say?"

-Hahaha, what's that?

-A typical third-rate villain: "I have no choice but to back down this time, but next time, no way!"

He was about to retort but sat back down, fearing it would backfire.

The nightmares from "that time" resurfaced.

Finishing the football league with a decent record was a saving grace, but the humiliation suffered at the hands of the basketball team was still a hot topic in the sports community's trash talk.

Kyle had never been able to shake off the trauma, and now he was about to become a laughingstock in the music world because of the same Asian.

"At least this isn't going on MiTube. Ugh."

The thought alone was horrifying.

Over the past three years, Kyle had become a regular on Angela's MiTube channel with various videos. Thanks to that, his Instagram followers had surged, and he had received various sponsorships.

Money wasn't an issue, but in this day and age, followers equate to power and prestige.

As a student-athlete, star power is a direct indicator, so Kyle also managed his image accordingly...

"What the... When did you start filming?"

He was startled to see his twin and enemy, Jessie, diligently filming with her phone.

Jessie responded with a bright smile.

"From the beginning."

"Isn't this a hidden camera? Who gave you permission to film?!"

"Of course, I got the teacher's permission. I wouldn't just film without asking. You know we make promotional videos for the concert every year, right?"

"Then why are you doing it? Usually, Angela does it. You're not planning to send this to her, are you?"

Jessie glanced at him while taking her eyes off the phone screen.

"Could you be quiet? Your voice is getting picked up. If you want, I'll do a mosaic and voice modulation, so just focus."

"......"

"It's over."

Even if she did that, the rumor would spread throughout the school.

Kyle began to deeply regret signing up for music classes in the first place.

A few days later.

Sarah held the sheet music close to her chest.

It was the sheet music Hyunsoo had given her after the mid-term check.

"It's a gift."

What? How can I accept this...

"I wrote it for you, so of course, it should go to you."

Recalling that moment made Sarah's small face blush.

The experience of Hyunsoo accompanying her while she sang the piece was a vivid memory of deep connection.

"A piece written for me."

Throughout history, many composers wrote pieces for friends, family, or lovers.

"I always thought it would be nice if that happened to me someday..."

She never dreamed she would receive such a wonderful piece.

As she happily caressed the sheet music, she made a decision.

"I can't just accept it."

She wanted to somehow repay Hyunsoo.

But she had never given a gift to anyone before, so she was at a loss.

"No matter what it is, it won't be as beautiful a memory as the mid-term check or as perfect as this piece."

After days of wracking her brain, she finally came up with a satisfying idea.

She mustered up her courage, made an appointment in advance, and went to the student council room.

"What brings you here?"

Jessie greeted her.

"Um..."

Just sitting across from Jessie made Sarah feel small.

Jessie had a mature appearance for her age, but it was her professional demeanor that made Sarah feel intimidated.

"This is also a stage."

Recalling her purpose, she took a deep breath.

"I want to record the piece. I don't think I can cover it with my own money, so I came to see if the school could provide some budget."

"If you were expecting an amateur level, you wouldn't have come to me, right?"

Sarah nodded seriously.

"The best way I can repay Hyunsoo is to perfectly perform his piece so that he isn't disappointed. I want to produce it as a sound recording to leave Hyunsoo's name behind."

Though she asked, risking rejection, the answer came surprisingly quickly.

"Alright. You already have professional experience, so the school will likely consider it positively. Hyunsoo, the composer, will also participate, right?"

"I'm going to ask him now... I thought it would be better to have some groundwork before bringing it up."

"Convincing Hyunsoo will be the hardest part. He's someone who does only what he wants."

"Oh..."

Seeing Sarah's visible disappointment, Jessie offered some encouragement.

"Don't worry too much. Hyunsoo will have a fondness for his piece. If you honestly tell him why you want to record it, that should be enough. He might decline, but at least your feelings will get across."

"You're right!"

Jessie's words significantly eased her burden.

"If Hyunsoo participates, the budget will be at least twice as much. He's a student who has the board's full attention... And you're planning to officially release it, right?"

"How did you know?"

"Why else would you try to gather as much funding as possible? You've already debuted, and you have successfully released music before, so I figured that was your plan."

Sarah nodded.

Though she still considered herself a "student" and hadn't gone on an official tour, her exceptional performance in various competitions had earned her recognition as a professional in the music world.

Especially in her home country, Germany, her popularity was immense. She had even performed as a guest with the Berlin Philharmonic, one of the top orchestras in the world.

The piece she sang, "The Voice I Just Heard," still occasionally topped classical charts.

"My fame might not be great, but it will help Hyunsoo make his official debut as a composer."

Ideally, she hoped Hyunsoo's first piece would be as successful as "The Voice I Just Heard," which earned her steady royalties...

"If we can just get a proper start, he will definitely receive more composition requests. He's talented enough that he'll succeed no matter what."

This was the best way she could repay him.

"Yes, there's a record label still interested in my follow-up piece. I plan to at least handle distribution through them."

"That's a good idea."

Jessie, seemingly impressed by Sarah's determination, thought for a moment before suggesting,

"Then you'll need a producer... How about I do it?"

Sarah's eyes widened.

"You?"

"Considering we have to record it here, my and Angela's connections can provide a highly professional environment for producing the track."

"Having you on board would be incredible."

"Then I'll handle securing the budget. You only need to do one thing I mentioned."

"What was that again?"

Jessie reminded her, and Sarah clenched her fists with determination as she left the student council room.

Hyunsoo was initially taken aback.

"I have something to tell you."

Sarah approached him directly in the hallway, speaking bluntly.

When he suggested they move to a quieter place on campus, she led him to a secluded spot.

With a face as red as if she were about to confess her feelings, she hesitated before finally speaking.

"Let's... do it together!"

"Huh?"

She mumbled the middle part, making it hard to hear. After taking a moment to calm down, she recounted her conversation with Jessie.

"Oh, so you want to produce a sound recording together?"

Sarah nodded, holding her breath as she awaited his answer.

Though he had no intention of declining, her doe-like eyes were very persuasive.

"Alright, let's do it. I think it will be fun working with you."

He had greatly enjoyed composing with her singing in mind, so he was looking forward to the recording.

"...!"

But instead of looking happy, Sarah's face grew even stiffer. She turned pale and, mumbling something, hurried away.

"Did I say something wrong?"

Scratching his head, Hyunsoo headed to the basketball court for practice.

* * *

"Yawn."

Adriana woke up late on the weekend, stretching languidly.

Staying up all night working on the RR design project with Hyunsoo's mom had become routine. Last night, she had fallen into a deep sleep after another late-night discussion.

"I can barely see."

Though her eyes were open, they were swollen, and she could only make out shapes.

"Ugh."

She shuffled like a zombie to the bathroom, navigating to the shower booth by feel.

Shhh-

She adjusted the water to the perfect temperature and soaked for a while.

"Even with enough sleep, I'm tired."

Mornings were always tough for her. After a quick shower, she went down to the living room.

"Oh."

Seeing Hyunsoo already in his usual spot, she quickly perked up.

"Good morning~."

Adriana greeted him in the most playful tone she could muster.

She wore a towel that barely covered her, pretending to conceal herself, though it was a futile gesture.

"..."

Hyunsoo just waved, his eyes glued to his book.

"Geez, studying even on weekends? School was just for attendance in my day..."

"..."

Still no response.

"This is boring."

She pouted, grumbling as she wandered around him, finally "accidentally" dropping her towel.

"Oop!"

Underneath, she wore a camisole and hot pants, considering Hyunsoo was still a minor.

She just wanted to see his surprised expression.

But Hyunsoo remained absorbed in his book, muttering to himself.

Now, feeling both prideful and curious, she asked,

"What book is so interesting..."

Adriana plopped down next to him, trying to sneak a peek at the book's content.
