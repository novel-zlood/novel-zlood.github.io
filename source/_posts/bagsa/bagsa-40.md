"Is this really confirmed?"

When Sarah suggested to Hyunsoo that they produce a music track, it wasn't a light-hearted proposal.

After all, she was a professional with release experience, and she wanted to provide a solid stepping stone for Hyunsoo.

The experience of systematically practicing and recording in a professional studio could be a significant asset in his future musical endeavors.

"But I never imagined it would come to this."

Even the usually composed Sasha looked shocked.

"Is it true that the San Francisco Symphony is participating as an orchestra? Is that confirmed?"

Expecting an answer that it was just a plan with alternatives prepared, Jessie confidently nodded.

"Yes. Once we coordinate the dates, we'll draft the contract. Of course, only the minimum number of players. The conductors tend to be quite immovable."

"Of course! The resident conductor of the San Francisco Symphony is considered a maestro. They wouldn't ordinarily involve themselves in a high school side project."

The fact that the renowned San Francisco Symphony had agreed in the first place was unbelievable.

Each member was a world-class musician.

"The music is good, and I thought we were just doing this among ourselves, but... now I need to give it my all?"

Jessie's proposal was so groundbreaking that even Sasha was nervous.

"Jessie sure is capable~."

The only person who naturally accepted the situation was Angela.

"Not just the San Francisco Symphony, but Hyde Studio is top-tier in this field, right? They must be booked for at least 2-3 years. Do you have connections there too?"

"Sometimes money is the most reliable connection."

"Oh. Now that I think about it, that was a dumb comment. Still, achieving this much over the weekend shows real skill."

"You've worked hard too. Although no one knows, it was Angela who got Ilya on board."

Everyone's attention turned to Angela.

She enjoyed the attention, making a V with her fingers.

"We got close while working on a MiTube project together."

"Ilya in producing, huh."

Everyone was amazed.

Ilya is currently the most popular teenage singer-songwriter in America.

Her story of self-teaching piano and guitar through MiTube, developing a passion for composition, and consistently uploading numerous practice pieces on Music Cloud from a young age, gaining popularity, was well-known.

Especially with her official debut album reaching the second-highest global sales in 2019 and winning five Grammy Awards earlier this year, she had quickly risen to a unique position.

Although they pursued different musical styles, Sarah, being the same age, was very interested in Ilya's career and timidly raised her hand.

"..."

Jessie hesitated for a moment before giving Sarah the floor.

"Speak. And next time, don't raise your hand, just talk comfortably."

"... It's hard to interrupt. Can I keep raising my hand?"

"As you wish."

Grateful even for such a small permission, Sarah nodded once and asked Angela,

"But isn't Ilya known for not doing collaborations?"

"Oh, are you a fan too? I thought you wouldn't be interested since you're in a different field, but you know a lot?"

"How could anyone not know Ilya?"

"True. But knowing about her collaboration stance means you follow her quite closely."

At that point, Sasha also became curious and joined the conversation.

"Then what made her participate this time? Friendship? Money?"

Instead of answering immediately, Angela turned on the screen on the wall and started mirroring.

"There's only one way to persuade a musician."

A video started playing on the screen.

"... Just show them good music. She volunteered, saying she wanted to do it."

"Huh?"

Hyunsoo, who had been closely examining the proposal, let out a small laugh as he watched the video.

The videos Jessie had taken of Hyunsoo with her phone were playing.

"I allowed her to keep those for personal use... but I didn't expect her to make it public like this."

Indeed, Angela, the master of views, had edited the rough videos into something quite watchable. No, it was more than watchable; the 12-minute video felt like it flew by in just 1-2 minutes.

"Wow."

By the time the last scene played, everyone was completely absorbed.

"Okay, I admit. Even I couldn't resist after seeing that last scene."

Sasha immediately understood Ilya's motivation.

Whiz-whiz-

Sarah nodded vigorously, her eyes sparkling with agreement.

Feeling triumphant, Angela looked at Hyunsoo.

"So, as the marketing manager, I want to upload this on MiTube. What do you think, Hyunsoo? Since this video even persuaded Ilya, wouldn't it increase the anticipation for <Aria> if MiTube subscribers saw it?"

Hyunsoo looked around.

Everyone had a face that said, "We definitely have to upload this."

"It's a bit embarrassing."

But if it made everyone happy and helped with the production of <Aria>, he had no choice but to sacrifice himself.

"Okay. Upload it. But I don't think I can go to school from tomorrow. If anyone asks, tell them I died of embarrassment."

Did they even hear him?

"Yay! I'll finish editing right away."

Angela ran out of the meeting room, beaming like a child on Christmas.

The remaining people didn't comfort Hyunsoo but rather expressed their eagerness for the video to be uploaded quickly, knowing it would become part of his dark history.

"..."

Angela's video, uploaded that very day, broke her 24-hour record once again.

[Is There Really a Musical Genius in the World?]

Views: 6.73 million, Comments: 120,000+

Jessie had provided Angela with a total of three videos.

Scene #1

A series of events that happened when she visited the [Music & Arts] instrument store in San Francisco with Hyunsoo.

- What the heck, is this a setup? Is that kind of tuning even possible?

- It's definitely a setup. No way, he tunes without even listening at the end! Are you still falling for this? Angela has sold her soul for views.

- It seems real. That Samuel guy is really famous. Google him. He was once called the King of Instruments, a very cringy title, but he has authority. Would he participate in such a B-grade setup?

Scene #2

Scenes of Hyunsoo intensely practicing piano at Jessie's house, followed by him listening to music all night at the theater until he fell asleep.

- Hey, is it possible for someone's piano skills to improve that much in just two hours? His skill suddenly jumped.

- The guy above, do you watch MiTube for the first time? It's just staging. Or maybe he was just slowly recovering his skills after not playing for a while.

- His acting is too good for that. You can see his finger strength and technique becoming more refined bit by bit.

- I don't know about anything else, but one thing's for sure, that Asian guy isn't manly. There's a girl who looks like an actress lying next to him, and he's just listening to music by himself?

- LOL

Scene #3

Hyunsoo composing while listening to Sarah and Kyle's presentation in music class. Followed by a stage where he accompanied Sarah singing <Aria>.

- This is insane. Isn't he a real musical genius? Composing on the spot like that?

- That's Sarah Wagner!! A contest winner and a skilled musician. It's so nice to see her here. Her voice is still the best in the world.

- Angela!!!! This is too much!! Cutting the song right before the highlight?? Even American Idol's worst ad villains wouldn't do that!!

- Isn't that the same Asian guy who was playing basketball and football last time?

- Wow, this guy is really racist. Not all Asians look the same, you know. Pay more attention. He's a completely different person.

- LOL wow, reverse racism here. It's the same guy. Don't you see the tag??? #HyunLee??

* * *

The next day, Hyunsoo's worst fear came true.

As soon as Charles saw Hyunsoo, he made a fuss.

"Oh? Here comes the music genius!"

"Music genius? What's that?"

"You don't know music genius?"

Finally, a fellow basketball player joined in.

"Ah, right. Wow, it's an honor for the music genius to grace such a humble place! Could you play a piano piece for us?"

"..."

No matter where he went in school, the reaction was similar.

The closer friends excessively praised him to the point he couldn't raise his head.

Even the acquaintances he wasn't close to whispered among themselves, but with his hearing as sharp as an animal's, Hyunsoo could hear everything, making him feel even more embarrassed.

- They say he's really good at music? Is it just a gimmick?

- I asked some students from the traditional music department, and even those prideful guys acknowledged him.

- He has no flaws. Good at studying, good at sports, and now music too?

- He's also the ultimate socialite. The first time I saw Jessie acting human was with him. Knowing Jessie had emotions was the biggest shock.

"This is all for <Aria>."

Hyunsoo repeated to himself several times as he arrived at the practice room.

While Jessie and Angela coordinated all the necessary recording preparations, he practiced <Aria> with the duo SaSa (Sarah & Sasha).

"Oh, you're here? Our music gen..."

"That's enough. Shall we start right away?"

Naturally, Sarah took the soprano part, Sasha the piano, and Hyunsoo took on the directing role.

-♩♪♫♪♩♪♫♪

"That was good, but you're both too focused on following the sheet music exactly. The sheet music is just a guide. It's not a map to walk step by step."

-♩♪♫♪♩♪♫♪

"Much better. But remember, the theme of this piece is the joy that music brings. Think about why you want to make music and what you find enjoyable about it. Play with those feelings in mind."

-♩♪♫♪♩♪♫♪

"Very good. But..."

Although Hyunsoo's musical career was much shorter than theirs, the SaSa duo followed his direction without any complaints.

They were geniuses themselves and accurately understood and applied his instructions.

"..."

'What's going on?'

However, amidst the excellent collaboration, something was subtly bothering Hyunsoo.

After repeating several times, the reason became clear.

"Ah, they're expressing what I want perfectly... but <Aria> itself is lacking. It doesn't fully showcase Sasha and Sarah's abilities."

It was a surprising realization.

Originally, <Aria> was composed after hearing Sarah's singing in music class, a custom-made soprano piece for her.

But in just two weeks, Sarah had grown, and the synergy with Sasha made <Aria> feel like an outdated piece.

"It was such a satisfying piece just recently."

Hyunsoo's improved musical sense highlighted the shortcomings of the piece.

"Let's call it a day for now. Thank you, both."

He was deep in thought on his way home.

"A growing genius, huh?"

He felt challenged. The more difficult the task, the sharper his focus became.

Hyunsoo started devising a plan to deal with the changing variables.

"I need to consider the overall level of the entire orchestra, not just the duo."

As soon as the thought occurred, he obtained albums from the San Francisco Symphony and listened to them until they were ingrained in his mind.

Eventually, he even purchased high-definition concert videos, where he found the clue to his solution.

"Ah, the conductor!"

A single conductor controls an orchestra of over a hundred musicians with just their gaze and gestures.

They unify the tempo and rhythm of the performance and give detailed instructions to each instrument for the intended musical expression.

The same piece can be interpreted very differently depending on the conductor's ability.

"This is it."

He spent an entire day rearranging <Aria>.

A piece that could adapt and change according to the musicians' skills.

Hyunsoo named the newly reborn piece <Aria of Joy>.
