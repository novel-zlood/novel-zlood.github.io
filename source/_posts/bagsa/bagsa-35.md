“……!”

Sasha found herself deeply focused on Hyunsoo's performance.

Chopin's Nocturne wasn't a difficult piece, nor did the performer use flashy techniques.

However, Hyunsoo's performance had a captivating charm that drew listeners in.

'He's already becoming free from the sheet music.'

It seemed he was inspired by Sasha's performance.

Originally, sheet music didn't contain all the information needed for a performance. It couldn't, in reality, and interpretation was always a part of it, making piano performance more interesting.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

'Is he imitating me?'

At first, she wasn't sure, but as the performance continued, it became clear.

“…….”

Hyunsoo was faithfully reproducing exactly how she had played the piano. By the end of the piece, it was so similar that she was left speechless.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

However, the third performance was a bit different.

'He's beginning to be conscious of even the unseen parts of the sheet music.'

The first performance was played diligently according to the rules set within the piece.

The second was a direct copy of Sasha's answer sheet.

In the third, his own interpretation began to emerge.

'It won't be easy, though.'

While new attempts should be welcomed, they seemed reckless for Hyunsoo.

'Changing the essence of the piece entirely.'

Nocturnes, as their name suggests, have a night-like quality.

They are calm, lyrical, and often embody melancholic emotions.

Even 'Op. 9, No. 2,' which is light and lively among the nocturnes, doesn't deviate from the night theme.

It’s a piece loved for its sweet development, like a stroll on a quiet night path.

- Wouldn't it be interesting to portray such a piece as a bustling marketplace in broad daylight?

Hyunsoo's performance seemed to say just that.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

“……!”

So, the beginning was unpleasant.

Although it used the same chords as a nocturne, the accompaniment and melody clashed, creating dissonance.

“Oh?”

Still, it was interesting enough to listen to. Was it really an intended result rather than a coincidence?

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

As the piece progressed, her curiosity grew.

'How is he going to lead this?'

Even Sasha, with her high understanding of music, became worried.

While the first part might be fresh, completing the piece with high quality required compositional skill.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

'Is this the cry of seasoned merchants advertising to customers?'

The consistently emphasized notes throughout the performance drew Sasha's attention.

'Is this part a fierce negotiation process?'

Then the accompaniment and melody intertwined, each exploring the other's domain.

Neither side was dominant, maintaining a delicate balance that increased the piece's tension.

'With just a bit of tweaking, it could be good enough to release as a piece.'

Sasha acknowledged it.

There were certainly rough parts, but strangely, as it neared the end, it became increasingly refined.

Though it was the first time she heard the arrangement, its delightful composition captivated her ears.

“…….”

Even after Hyunsoo's performance ended, Sasha remained silent for a while.

'A talent that learns one thing and knows two.'

She showed him a way to not be bound by the sheet music, and he not only grasped it but applied it immediately.

It was fascinating. Although she had given advice many times, she never felt she cared enough about someone to want to teach them.

She had always been busy improving her own skills by looking up, never thinking of dedicating her efforts to teach someone her age.

……At least until now.

'How much could he absorb if I seriously taught him?'

Hiding her educational zeal for the first time, Sasha spoke as calmly as she could.

“That was a great arrangement. The idea was interesting, and the way you kept the listener's attention was refreshing. But if you do it this way, the sound might become a bit richer.”

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

Switching places again, Sasha blended her experience into Hyunsoo's arrangement.

Even the same notes sounded much louder when various harmonies were brought to life.

By adjusting the pedal to control the resonance of the sound, the bustling, lively atmosphere of a marketplace came to life even more.

Hyunsoo's eyes sparkled.

“Wow. It's really different. A competition winner can deepen things after just one listen? I've learned a lot just by watching.”

“Haha, well, I've played the piano a lot. Do you want to give it a try now?”

Before Sasha even finished speaking, Hyunsoo got up from his seat, his whole body itching with excitement.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

“……!”

Once again, Hyunsoo replicated her performance exactly as it was.

'A genius?'

Perfect pitch usually only allows one to accurately distinguish the notes they hear.

Playing the heard music exactly on the piano is purely a matter of rigorous training.

While Sasha had practiced professionally for the past 10 years, making the keyboard feel like a part of her body, what about Hyunsoo?

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

He clumsily followed the complex harmonies, and after repeating them a few times, he quickly became familiar with them, showing no clumsiness at all.

Eventually, he went a step further, gradually refining Sasha's arrangement.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

'He even touched up parts I didn't correct.'

Since it was an impromptu arrangement, it was bound to be lacking. Hyunsoo instinctively noticed those parts and corrected them while playing.

He changed the composition of the harmonies or adjusted the tempo, smoothing out the piece.

At this point, she had doubts.

'Am I just a good teacher?'

Sasha praised Hyunsoo with an excited voice.

“Very good! It's become an excellent piece. You applied rubato at the end, did you know that?”

“Rubato?”

“It's playing freely without being tied to the sheet music's rhythm, but you can't completely ignore it. If you play quickly at the beginning, you should play slowly at the end to maintain the overall rhythm. So, when did you use it…….”

By now, it was implicit that Hyunsoo would get up from his seat when Sasha stood up.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

When Sasha demonstrated,

“Wow.”

Hyunsoo would immediately apply it and even adapt it.

“Well done. Do you want to try this too?”

Because he followed her teachings so well, Sasha also got excited.

'Is this the fun my master had when he took me in?'

Eventually, they didn't even need words.

“……Can you do it?”

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

“I'll try!”

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

Even without explaining the concept, he would immediately grasp it upon hearing.

The first lesson was very successful.

Originally, she planned to spend about an hour, but both Hyunsoo and Sasha got so engrossed that they practiced together for three hours.

Sasha let out a helpless laugh.

'I feel like he caught up with my six months in just three hours today.'

It wasn't an exaggeration. Thinking that Hyunsoo had matched her efforts for the first six months of learning piano in just one day made her feel empty.

'Is this how my friends felt about me?'

Yet, she felt a greater sense of accomplishment. While he might have learned piano well from anyone, it was her effort that helped Hyunsoo grow to this extent, making her feel incredibly proud.

'What should I teach next?'

Reflecting on the teachings she received from her master, Sasha pondered deeply on what techniques to pass on to Hyunsoo.

“Ah?”

During this process, she received much inspiration. Concepts that had been vaguely formed became much clearer and more systematic, improving her fundamental skills and affecting her overall performance.

- I had an epiphany. Your expression of emotions has become much richer. If you continue to diligently practice with this feeling, good results will follow.

She received high praise from her normally stingy master.

'They say the teacher learns more.'

Sasha showed great enthusiasm and looked forward to her lessons with Hyunsoo even more.

'Let's teach him seriously.'

……At least, that was her mindset initially.

'Wait, this isn't right?!'

However, in the second lesson, Hyunsoo caught up with Sasha's second-year skills.

In the third lesson, he reached her fourth-year skills.

In the fourth lesson, he caught up with her seventh-year skills, and his eyes trembled violently.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

Hyunsoo played even Chopin's difficult piano concerto smoothly.

'He's already playing as well as most music school scholarship students. It wouldn't be strange if he started preparing for the high school division competition immediately.'

If Sasha hadn't witnessed his growth process with her own eyes, she would never have believed it. It was an impossible growth unless he had been hiding his skills all along and only gradually revealing them.

'People usually hit a wall, have a period of contemplation, and fall into a slump…….'

Hyunsoo was the opposite.

The more challenging it became, the more he enjoyed it and practiced day and night.

As he grew faster, it made Sasha, who was watching, fall into a state of shock.

“Hah.”

After a grueling six-hour fourth lesson, Sasha walked down the corridor with a pale face, completely drained.

'What is the meaning of life?'

Step by step, she contemplated her inner self, honing her mind when suddenly her phone rang.

[Hyunsoo: Oh, I forgot to schedule our next lesson. When is a good time for you, Sasha? How about in three days?]

“…….”

[Hyunsoo: Thank you so much, Sasha. You know, I'm having so much fun these days? I can't stop thinking about piano, day and night. How will I wait until the next lesson?]

[Hyunsoo: What should I practice in the meantime? I feel so inspired, maybe because I've been listening to a lot of music. I even want to try composing, but is that too early?]

Sasha couldn't easily reply.

When they started the lessons, she was also very excited. Seeing Hyunsoo absorb everything like a sponge motivated her.

'Now I'm scared.'

But now, she was afraid of lessons with Hyunsoo. How far could he grow? Would he surpass her? What emotions would she encounter then?

Maybe there are no bad people, just bad environments.

Sasha said they should check their schedules and arrange the next lesson, but she wasn't very enthusiastic about it.

-♩..♪.♫...♪

That internal conflict affected her one-on-one lessons with her master.

“Sasha? Where is your mind?”

“Oh! I'm sorry. I'll try again.”

Sasha desperately tried to focus and continue, but Daniel Baum eventually stopped her.

“That's enough. I don't think any more playing will be meaningful.”

“I'm sorry.”

“What's going on?”

“Well…… Ah, it's nothing. It's just a childish worry…….”

Daniel Baum kept staring at Sasha. His attitude indicated he would wait until she answered. Finally, Sasha gave up and confessed.

“Master, have you ever been afraid?”

“What do you mean?”

“Have you ever been overwhelmed by someone else's talent, feeling so hopeless that you lose all motivation just by watching them, like they have a devil's talent?”

Daniel Baum stared deeply into Sasha's eyes, as if looking into his own soul, and then spoke.

“I've always felt that way. Watching many colleagues made me feel that way, and to be honest, the reason I took you in as a student was because I felt that fear every time I saw you. I couldn't play as well as you at your age, and I still worry about how much you'll have grown by the time you're my age, fearing the day I have nothing left to teach you.”

Sasha, accustomed to her master being like a god, was deeply shocked.

“Really? You felt that way, Master?”

“Yes. That kind of inferiority? Jealousy is very desirable. It constantly stimulates you to work harder. On the other hand, if you're not in such an environment, you should be wary. It can easily lead to stagnation.”

Sasha still looked troubled as she asked.

“It’s harder than it sounds. I’ve been so unmotivated lately that I haven’t been practicing well.”

Daniel Baum spoke firmly.

“In the end, you only have two choices. Admit defeat and give up, or believe in the effort that has never betrayed you and work harder than anyone else.”

“……!”

Sasha's eyes widened. Though it wasn't immediate, her master's words lingered in her mind for days.

The conclusion was already decided, even if the contemplation was long.

'Yes. I am Sasha Petronova. A pianist recognized as the world's best prospect. If I work harder than anyone else, that will be enough.'

From that day on, Sasha practiced with a fierce determination. She admitted she had been complacent. There were no rivals among her peers, and the pianists she looked up to were all at least ten years older.

Though she practiced daily, she had been arrogant. She had been laid-back, and it had all turned into poison.

'It's not too late to come to my senses now.'

Sasha devoted herself entirely to music. Apart from eating, sleeping, and minimal exercise, she dedicated her body and mind to the piano.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

If she had even a little strength left in a day, she played one more piece and listened to endless performances.

'I can do more. I can do better. This isn't my limit.'

She didn't avoid lessons with Hyunsoo either. Now, it felt like they both grew more when they openly exchanged musical ideas.

'It's fun. Was music always this fun?'

A new wind blew into her somewhat monotonous daily life.

Sasha played the piano with as much passion as when she first started music.

* * *

“Now, we will conduct a midterm evaluation.”

By the third week, Professor Alberto changed the way he conducted the lessons.

'No way?'

Professor Alberto’s notorious midterm evaluations.

They were always conducted in unexpected ways and heavily reflected in the grades, making them infamous among the scholarship students...

This time was no different.
