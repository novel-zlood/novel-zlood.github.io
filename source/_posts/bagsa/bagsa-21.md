A few days before the pride-driven basketball match between the football team and the basketball team.

With the league opener approaching, the football team intensified their training.

They had been gathered since summer vacation for systematic training, and over the past few days, they had been learning new tactics, finding their top form.

"Great! If we keep this up, the league championship is ours."

Even Coach Raban, who always seemed fiery, was smiling contentedly as he praised the players today.

"Everyone, good job."

"Hey, your passing has improved!"

"Whoa, that tackle was brutal. Even in a practice game, it was impressive."

Kyle, as the team captain, also encouraged each player individually.

However, some players had particularly gloomy expressions.

"What's wrong? Not feeling well?"

"Did you hear?"

"Hear what?"

"Coach Russell has made up his mind. He declared that this season, he won't recruit any basketball team members from the football team."

"Wow. He's still like that."

The football league starts at the beginning of the first semester, while the basketball season starts at the end. 

Since the overlap is short, some players used to participate in both leagues after the football season ended.

However, from the time Coach Russell first took over, he drew a line, saying that late-joining team members disrupted the atmosphere and hindered team cohesion.

- If you haven't applied for the tryouts, you won't even be considered as a candidate.

It was a message to pick a clear path without playing both sides.

For players aiming for scholarships by excelling in as many sports as possible to get into college, this was a bolt out of the blue.

Kyle didn't take it seriously.

"He was all about that last year too. But what happened in the end? When the league started to go south, he recruited you guys right away."

It was to be expected.

At the high school level, the boundaries between sports were blurry.

Kids who were good at sports learned the basic three major sports systematically from a young age: football, basketball, and baseball.

Unless it was a matter of personal aptitude, they chose their main sport based on their talents as they progressed.

The more physically gifted played football, followed by basketball, and then they were pushed to less popular sports.

Thus, coaches from other sports were usually desperate to replenish their top-tier resources after the football season ended.

"Phew. Who doesn't know that? It's just that this time the basketball team's atmosphere is different. Damn, we're screwed."

"Can't you just wait and see? Why so anxious? Honestly, how many of the basketball team's starters are better than you guys? Maybe Dianté? Let's focus on the league for now."

At that moment, another player pulled out his phone.

"Kyle, you haven't seen this yet, have you?"

It was a video of the tryouts uploaded on Angela's MeTube.

"No way, why did it get 5 million views?"

Kyle watched the video with suspicion.

"Tsk, they call these guys starters..."

The content of the game was such that he couldn't help but click his tongue.

Although the starter team won in the end, they were dragged around the entire game, showing the basketball team's level.

"That must be the Asian kid."

If there was one standout player, it was Hyunsoo. Although it was an edited video, he seemed to lead most of the plays.

"There's a rumor that a kid named Hyun and Charles joined the basketball team, and the team has transformed drastically. Even the coach's attitude suggests they're serious about sticking to principles this time."

"They're so determined that they won't make any additional recruits, even to set an example for next year. They're playing the long game."

Kyle let out a bitter laugh.

"Don't you know Dianté's temper? Do you think they'll be cohesive after such a public humiliation? He'll definitely throw all kinds of fits. Just wait, there will be an opportunity."

"Haven't you heard? Dianté was the first to back down. It looks like he's training almost daily with them."

"What??"

It was the most shocking thing he'd heard recently.

"Dianté? That guy? Really? He swallowed his pride?? Is that even possible?"

"Yeah. It seems that the Asian kid has such a good personality and skills that the coach is rebuilding the team around him."

"Hmm."

Only then did Kyle feel the seriousness of the situation.

If it came to a point where players had to choose between football and basketball, starting from next year, the football team would suffer significant damage.

"The really good players won't be a problem, but the bench players will likely opt for the basketball team where they can shine more."

It meant a thinning player base.

Kyle, who needed to win the league before graduation and achieve good results in the state tournament, was getting a headache.

"I didn't want to go this far."

Luckily, he was a quick thinker.

"Wait. I have a good idea."

"What is it?"

"Isn't it just a matter of us smashing their starters in basketball? We'll show Coach Russell what level his precious team really is."

"...?!"

"If the basketball team realizes their place and their skills are exposed to the students, even Coach Russell won't be able to be stubborn."

There was no other way now.

Even if the basketball team had gone through team training, the individual skills of the football team were far superior.

If they could show the 'wall' that can't be broken by effort alone, the basketball team would face all kinds of criticism every time they lost a league game.

- Is it true that the football team plays better basketball than the basketball team? No matter how important team cohesion is, what's the point if individual skills are lacking?

As the league rankings drop, the pressure from students and the board would increase.

Then Coach Russell would have no choice. Ultimately, he would have to recruit football players, just like last year.

That was Kyle's grand plan...

Kyle looked at the scoreboard with a devastated face.

[51 : 7]

"Ah..."

He wished it were just a dream.

"It wasn't like this last semester..."

Both the football and basketball teams knew each other's skills very well since most starters were in their 3rd or 4th year.

"What happened in the meantime?"

They lost without doing anything.

They had no chance to utilize their physical superiority.

The moment they lost focus, they conceded a goal, and when they regained their senses, the ball was taken away.

"Those three. They would definitely be effective in the league."

Kyle couldn't help but acknowledge Hyunsoo and his two teammates.

They moved as one without needing to coordinate verbally.

Even in the midst of being thoroughly trounced, he found their connection so natural that it was beautiful.

"Dianté playing defense?"

The most shocking sight was Dianté, who used to focus solely on offense, now putting more effort into defense.

To think that this was all due to one person... it was unbelievable.

Just then, Hyunsoo made eye contact with Kyle and approached with a smile.

"Good game. It was really helpful."

"..."

Kyle had nothing to say. If it had been sarcastic, he would have at least cursed, but feeling the sincerity just made him feel miserable.

Not missing his emotional change, Jesse approached.

"You did that on purpose, right? Gathered the football rejects, trashed them hard, and then lost horribly to boost the basketball team's pride. Wow, as expected of the captain."

"..."

Angela also jumped over and added a word.

"Thanks for the MeTube material. I was trying to figure out a way to make content since every video with Hyunsoo hits 5 million views... It's all thanks to you. Should I go without a mosaic?"

"...!"

Kyle's face turned pale.

Just three sentences from them shattered his mental state.

Even without saying anything, the looks from the basketball team members watching from the corner were enough to make Kyle feel humiliated.

"And if the video goes up?"

Not only in school but in the region, and every team they meet, it would become fuel for trash talk.

No matter how well the football team performed this season, the better they did, the more today's game would be remembered with impact.

- Yeah, no matter what, they're below the basketball team.

Moreover, if today's incident, which happened due to his unilateral decision, reached Coach Raban's ears, he didn't even want to imagine the aftermath.

Realizing the situation, Kyle had no choice but to be humble.

"Hey, Hyunsoo. I have a favor to ask..."

"What is it? You're almost as polite as you are with your father."

Despite Jesse's sharp remark, Kyle stayed in character.

"...I won't forget today's humiliation."

"Seeing how well the basketball team works together today, I think it would be great if our team could learn something. How about playing a football game?"

"...Will we be able to learn anything from you guys playing football?"

"Of course. The basketball team is also made up of kids who have played football for a long time, and players who work well together shine in any sport."

Hyunsoo pondered deeply, wondering if that was indeed the case.

Of course, Jesse couldn't hide his sneer.

"You're pathetic, Kyle. Since basketball seems impossible, you want to salvage your pride by smashing us in football?"

"What are you talking about! I'm just suggesting a friendly game. If today's game helped you, I'm cautiously asking if we could learn something too."

"Sigh... Does sweet-talking make nonsense any less nonsense?"

"..."

Fire blazed from Kyle's eyes, but he couldn't lose his temper.

Luckily, Hyunsoo looked at the basketball team without much thought.

"Well, I'll ask the guys first. It's not something I can decide alone."

"Thanks! It's just a practice game, so let's have fun."

"Sure."

Hyunsoo returned to the court where the team members were gathered.

Jesse was extremely excited, and Angela turned on her camera again and followed.

"What do you think, everyone? Want to give it a try?"

The response was unexpectedly enthusiastic.

"Absolutely!"

Unanimously, without a single dissenting voice, Dianté subtly asked Hyunsoo.

"You're going to play too, right?"

"Me? I've never played, is that okay?"

"Of all sports, football is doable. It's 100% physical. You just need to receive the ball and run. You have to play, you know?"

Everyone nodded vehemently, making Hyunsoo a bit flustered.

"Okay, let's practice a bit. Watching yesterday's opener was fun."

"Great!"

"Those guys are dead. Let's destroy them."

"I've been annoyed by their arrogance. Let's show them!"

"..."

Although it wasn't the reaction Hyunsoo intended, everyone seemed to be having fun, so he felt good.

However, Charles expressed some concern.

"Do you think the coaches will approve? Today's basketball game might already be an issue, but football? No way."

All players are prohibited from activities that could cause injuries.

If they were to get injured and miss training or games, it would be a massive loss for the team.

"I'll take care of that."

Jesse glanced at Kyle, then started making phone calls with a wicked smile.

* * *

Wednesday at 5 PM.

The football game was scheduled at the most manageable time considering both teams' training schedules.

The board's condition was a reduced 7-man game instead of the usual 11.

Many rules were simplified, and to prevent injuries, all protective gear was to be worn like in official matches. Both teams' coaches agreed to strictly referee the game.

"Why are there so many people?"

On the day of the match, Hyunsoo experienced deja vu.

Like during the season opener, cars were parked along the roadside, and the stadium was packed with people.

Standing on the field, he could see thousands waving and cheering for him.

- There he is! That's Hyunsoo.

- Wow, he looked small in the video, but seeing him in person, he's quite big?

- Well, he looks small because the people around him are so big. But for a player, he is small.

- I wonder what kind of spectacle he'll put on today.

Angela giggled awkwardly.

"Sorry. I think it's because of my video."

[(Not a Prank) What Happens When a High School Football Team Faces a Basketball Team? (Basketball Edition)]

Views: 3.33 million, Comments: 110,000+

Having become obsessed with MeTube, she stayed up all night to upload the video, which racked up over 3 million views in just two days.

The response was explosive. The match, where the physically superior football team was helplessly toyed with by the basketball team, was pure comedy.

Especially since the video was from Hyunsoo's perspective, showcasing his super plays, and edited to look even more impressive, it drew an excessive amount of attention from viewers.

At the end of the video, there was an introduction to the (Football Edition), including the date and time of the match... drawing not only the entire school but also other students from the region to come watch.

"Meanwhile, the board even sold tickets. Everyone's amazing."

Hyunsoo marveled, clicking his tongue.

"You got a lot of help from me, right? Next time, make sure to do some content with me."

"Hyunsoo, anything you want."

As the teams lined up before the game started, the stadium, filled with thousands, fell silent.

- Did they adjust the number of basketball team members? The offense and defense lineups are all the same.

- Of course. While the football team can use 11 separate players for offense and defense, the basketball team doesn't have the resources for that.

- True. This is the power balance we need.

- By the way, what position is Hyunsoo going to play? The video said he has almost no football experience.

- Is the basketball team starting on defense? ...He'll probably play Safety on defense, right?

Safety stands at the back, establishing the last line of defense.

It requires speed and good judgment to respond actively to the ever-changing offensive tactics, making it a very important role.

It was the perfect position for Hyunsoo to play on defense.

"...What?"

So, not just the spectators but also the football team expected him to take that position, and they all took their positions accordingly... but when they saw Hyunsoo's position, they exchanged puzzled looks.

"Are you insane?"

One of the football team members couldn't help but curse.

Hyunsoo was standing in the Defensive End position.

It is a frontline defense position typically filled by the biggest and strongest players who can block offensive players or break through the offensive line to attack the quarterback.

Seeing Hyunsoo, who would be a weak spot in the defense line, taking his stance with a serious face, the offensive line, several weight classes bigger, sneered.

"He's in for a proper initiation."

They were poised to crush him as soon as the play started.

"Hike!"

As quarterback Kyle gave the signal for the ball, the offensive line charged at Hyunsoo.

It was a precarious situation, like a small boat facing a giant wave.

What happened next was something no one expected.

"Gah!"

Suddenly, Kyle was tackled squarely and thrown backward. The impact was so severe that he couldn't breathe for a while.

'What just happened?'

He was blindsided, not even seeing who hit him.

Seeing the hand reaching to help him up, Kyle's face twisted.

Hyunsoo...?!

"Are you okay? Should I take it easy since it's a practice game?"
