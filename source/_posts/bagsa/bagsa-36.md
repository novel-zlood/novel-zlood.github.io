Alberto teacher recited the midterm check-up content with a dry expression.

“Some of the original 10 groups have merged, reducing the total to 6 groups. This midterm check-up will be conducted in a way where two groups critique each other.”

Barely had he finished speaking when sighs of relief could be heard all around.

-Whew. Thank goodness. It's just a regular critique.

-What's going on? From what I've heard from people who took the teacher's class before, they all said their mental state was completely shattered here at least once.

Critiquing each other was a familiar class format for almost all students in the arts and sports fields.

“……”

Alberto teacher waited silently until the students calmed down. A few students, feeling anxious, tensed up and fell silent.

“Every musician should have a good ear. Not just the sense to discern good music, but also the ability to come up with specific ways to improve the weak points.”

Sure enough, as Alberto teacher continued, the students' faces grew darker.

“The ability to accurately identify and supplement weaknesses is a precious asset for a musician to continuously grow. ……Therefore, in this midterm check-up, I will test each group's critique ability.”

When Group A presents, paired Group B will critique them.

Then the remaining Groups C to F will critique Group B's critique.

“Evaluations will be based on how accurately you identify the strengths and weaknesses in Group A's presentation and whether you provide constructive critiques that help them show a better performance.”

If the remaining groups can provide a better critique, points will be deducted. If Group B provides constructive criticism that Group A can actually apply and improve upon, they will receive extra points.

-As expected of the master of critiques, Teacher Al……

-Isn't it too cruel to have our critiques evaluated right in front of everyone, especially when just critiquing on the spot is already stressful?

-Then wouldn't it be advantageous to critique a group that isn't good? That way, there will be more to point out, and when it comes to evaluating us, they won't do well.

It seemed the students' strategizing had already begun.

“This midterm check-up will account for 30% of your overall grade, and based on the results, you will be given the choice of concert presentation order.”

“……!”

Upon hearing the reward for the midterm check-up, the students' eyes burned with even more determination.

-Grades are important, but there's no way I'm giving up the order!

The most memorable performances in a concert were always the first or the last. Those two slots were the longest and most coveted by music scholarship students.

“Teacher!”

Finally, one enthusiastic student couldn't hold back and asked.

“Are we going to randomly select the group we will critique this time as well?”

The slightly noisy classroom instantly fell silent. The sound of swallowing could be heard.

Alberto teacher shook his head with a faint smile.

“This time, it will be your choice. I'll give you five minutes to submit the names of two mutually agreed-upon groups.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone jumped up from their seats to negotiate.

-Hey, let's partner with our group! Quickly!!

-Come on! We already thought your group would be the easiest, and now you're coming to us??

-Oh? Where's that confidence coming from?

-Just wait. We'll critique you so thoroughly that you'll develop stage fright.

Surprisingly, no one approached Sasha's group.

-Hey, how about Sasha's group instead? There's an Asian kid in there, so they might have some flaws.

-Forget it. Have you ever heard Sasha's critique? He crushes with facts, and no one can withstand it. The skill gap is so big that it just feels like hitting a wall.

-Is it that bad? Sasha is super nice and gentle.

-His personality might be, but he critiques with utmost sincerity to help. Remember violin genius Susan? After Sasha critiqued her once, she fell into a slump and took a semester off.

What? That's why she took a leave of absence??

It seemed everyone was subtly avoiding Sasha.

“What should we do?”

Sasha and Hyunsoo had a more urgent concern than selecting a group.

“The other groups seem to have a few repertoires prepared.”

Sasha rubbed his chin with a troubled expression.

“Have we focused too much on piano lessons?”

They had been focusing more on Hyunsoo's piano lessons than preparing for the concert presentation.

Caught off guard by the unexpected midterm check-up, they hadn't thought of preparing. They were now in a situation where they had to perform a duet without ever having practiced together.

“Wait a minute.”

Sasha asked Alberto teacher something and returned with an awkward smile.

“He said as soon as the groups are decided, we start right away. The concert preparation state is also part of the check-up.”

“Really? Then should we pick one of the pieces we've played before?”

“…….”

Sasha looked at Hyunsoo, who answered nonchalantly, and gave a helpless smile.

“You don't seem too worried?”

“It’s fun, isn't it? The crisis that suddenly befell the genius piano boy. How will he overcome this situation with a novice?”

“……Hehe. Are you calling me the novice?”

“Hmm? Anyone can see I'm the novice. I’m giving this level of handicap so our bored genius pianist could get nervous. How thrilling.”

Normally, if someone was this carefree, it would be extremely annoying, but because it was Hyunsoo, Sasha felt a strange sense of ease. He knew Hyunsoo's confidence wasn't just a bluff.

Of course, that didn't mean all the worries disappeared.

‘Regardless of the grades, we must perform the finale.’

Even on a small stage, as semi-professionals, their pride wouldn't allow them to settle for anything less than the most spotlighted finale.

‘Should we pick one of the pieces we've practiced and go with the feeling that I'm supplementing it?’

They could play one of the pieces Hyunsoo had practiced, and Sasha could add harmonies to enrich the sound, resulting in a fairly decent performance.

Ideally, they would perform a duet piece composed to blend two pianos into one, but for now, that seemed impossible.

‘No, wait. Hyunsoo's sight-reading is top-notch. If it's a suitable duet piece, he can handle it.’

Sight-reading means playing a piece by looking at the music sheet for the first time.

Considering that even skilled pianists make mistakes with untrained pieces, playing an unpracticed duet was a huge risk.

Normally, Sasha would outright reject such a choice.

‘Am I really volunteering for this? Sasha, you've become someone who can't be satisfied with ordinary performances.’

Having gotten used to fresh attempts and constant stimulation through practice with Hyunsoo, Sasha found it hard to be excited by stable and predictable performances.

So, even though it was a reckless proposal, he went ahead and suggested it.

“Since it's just a midterm check-up, how about trying a duet piece? We're familiar with each other's styles, so even if it's the first time, we might sync up well.”

“Oh. Good idea.”

As expected, Hyunsoo, who always did something if it was fun, didn't refuse.

“If we're going for that, how about this?”

Instead, he took it a step further.

“……!”

Hearing Hyunsoo's suggestion, Sasha's eyes widened.

“……You're crazy.”

“Not at all. I trust you.”

No matter how hard Sasha stared, Hyunsoo was serious.

‘I have to refuse this.’

Sasha's rational mind desperately tried to stop him. No matter how he spun the hope circuit, he couldn't foresee a good outcome.

“……”

But his wildly pounding heart wouldn't calm down.

‘Doesn't it sound too fun?’

Sasha sighed deeply and nodded.

“Alright, let's do it.”

* * *

Within about five minutes, the groups to critique each other were decided.

“Then, which group will start?”

Alberto teacher asked, not expecting an answer.

Most students preferred to go last, so drawing lots to determine the order had been the unspoken rule.

“Teacher!”

Today was different.

A male student with rough blonde hair like a lion's mane raised his hand.

“Kyle?”

“We'll start first. There’s extra points for going first, right?”

Kyle, who usually dozed off or fooled around in the corner, was unusually enthusiastic today.

Alberto looked at the submitted list and asked Sasha.

“Is this agreed upon with your group?”

“Not exactly, but it doesn't matter. Hyunsoo, are you okay with it?”

Hyunsoo nodded.

Whether they went first or last, they didn't have any extra time to prepare.

“Then Kyle and Sarah? Come out and set up.”

Kyle smiled brightly and set up his electric guitar and amp.

“What’s up with you? Why the sudden change?”

Jesse, sitting nearby, frowned and gave him a scolding look, but Kyle ignored it.

‘Lucky me.’

As soon as he heard the midterm check-up details, Kyle had planned to target Hyunsoo's team.

‘I already assessed their skills at home.’

He didn't repeat the mistake he made during the basketball and football matches, where he underestimated Hyunsoo based on his physical appearance and ended up humiliated.

This time, he carefully observed Hyunsoo's piano skills.

When Hyunsoo visited his home, he played the piano enthusiastically for about two hours, allowing Kyle to gauge his abilities.

He played better than expected, but he was still a beginner.

‘If he was acting to deceive me for that long, then I must acknowledge his skill.’

No matter how talented Sasha was, if Hyunsoo was the target, there would be plenty to critique.

‘And they haven't even decided on their presentation piece?’

Kyle took the initiative to deprive them of the minimal preparation time.

“Are you ready?”

Lost in his thoughts, Kyle snapped back to reality at Alberto teacher's question.

“Yes.”

“Then let’s begin.”

Kyle's flashy guitar solo started the presentation.

-♪♩♫♪♫♪

‘Not bad.’

Hyunsoo nodded slightly, appreciating the performance.

Kyle skillfully executed various techniques without making mistakes.

Even among the music scholarship students, there were murmurs of admiration.

-What? He's not just a dumb jock?

-See? I told you. He’s quite good. If he sticks with it, he could pursue music.

The world is unfair. He has everything except a good personality.

-♫♩♪♩♫

“……!”

When Sarah began to sing, all eyes turned to her.

Specializing in vocal music, Sarah, a soprano, showcased her ability to navigate very high pitches beautifully.

-As expected, Sarah is in a different class.

-Amazing. How can such a clear sound come from a person?

Hyunsoo hummed along quietly, enjoying the song.

‘Her voice is so sweet.’

Kyle's guitar playing was impressive, but Sarah’s singing captivated him from the start, teasing his ears and stimulating his brain.

With each phrase she sang, the notes naturally floated in his mind.

‘A moment worth preserving.’

Unconsciously, Hyunsoo took out a sketchbook and pen from his bag.

“What are you doing?”

Unable to contain his curiosity, Sasha whispered softly.

Instead of answering, Hyunsoo began sketching out the musical notes.

At first, he transcribed Sarah's singing.

-♩♪♪♫♪

Like a form of dictation, he wrote down the music she sang.

Although it was not a fast song, transcribing it while listening was still a challenge…….

Sasha couldn't believe his eyes.

‘What’s happening?’

With remarkably swift hand movements, the sheet music was filling up.

As if there were staff lines, notes and symbols were being written down evenly.

Moreover, as he got used to it, Hyunsoo began to predict how the song would proceed, even though it was his first time hearing it.

He wrote down the music before Sarah sang it.

And most of the time, it matched. It was as if Sarah was following Hyunsoo’s sheet music.

Hyunsoo felt a peculiar thrill as his predictions turned out to be correct.

‘Hmm?’

However, there were some mistakes here and there. Hyunsoo pondered why and then nodded.

‘The music is good, but it doesn’t suit a soprano.’

The original piece was good, and Sarah was performing it wonderfully.

But primarily composed for an electric guitar, it highlighted Kyle's performance while sacrificing her voice.

Unconsciously, Hyunsoo started to make adjustments.

‘It would be better if she sang it this way.’

It was frustrating. Such an extraordinary soprano talent wasn't fully utilized. The more he listened, the more stifling it felt.

‘If it were me……?’

Hyunsoo gave up on merely arranging the piece. Making minor tweaks wouldn't satisfy him. He completely deconstructed the original.

Focusing solely on Sarah’s voice, he contemplated what kind of music would suit her.

Then, something extraordinary happened.

‘What is this?’

A new world unfolded in his mind. Sarah's beautiful tone and Hyunsoo's established musical world clashed.

At first, it was like oil and water, never blending. But suddenly, with a flash of inspiration, they harmonized into one.

[♩♪♫♪♩♪♫♪]

Without intending, a symphony of notes never heard before unfolded.

All Hyunsoo had to do was write it down as fast as possible before it vanished.
