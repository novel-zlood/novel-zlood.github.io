The director, Clark Soderman, who was leading the review, frowned as he looked at Hyunsoo's third class plan.

"Fashion design?"

"Yes, that's correct. I'm particularly interested in handbag design, so I tailored my plan accordingly."

"You want to audit a design class at our sister school, San Fran Art Academy (SAA)?"

Though not as well-known as Parsons or FIT in the East, SAA is a recognized fashion school in the West.

Thanks to investments from Silicon Valley, many famous designers have been invited to teach special semester-long classes recently, making it a popular choice for fashion students to take as an elective.

‘I didn’t even know this was possible, but Jessie’s help was significant.’

"Hah. And you want to take it with a partner too?"

"Yes. Since the class is of a high level, I plan to handle the design aspect while my partner, who has practical experience, takes care of the actual production. This way, we won’t inconvenience other college students."

A silence ensued for a while.

Hyunsoo already knew that the situation was not in his favor.

‘He was unpleasant in the past too, this man is consistent. Ah... but it's understandable. From his perspective, it was just a year ago.’

Indeed, the words that came out of Director Soderman’s mouth were aggressive.

"Do you treat school as a hobby?"

"No, I attend for fun."

"What?"

His face hardened.

Although Hyunsoo answered honestly, Director Soderman, a person of authority, might see this as a sort of provocation.

Of course, Hyunsoo didn’t care much.

"I find attending school enjoyable, so I attend diligently."

"Hoo."

Director Soderman adjusted his glasses and glared at him sharply.

"Fun? Do you understand how intensely students compete and strive to survive in our school? We granted you the privilege to take three elective courses, and what is this? Music? PE? Fashion??"

"I didn’t think it would be an issue since other scholarship students also take elective courses."

"That’s because they are scholarship students in the arts! They’ve been learning consistently since childhood and are going to college for that, so we invest in them... It’s not a privilege given for you to take up as a hobby whenever you are bored."

Hyunsoo acknowledged.

"Listening to your words, I realize I was short-sighted."

"Well, you might not have known. If you rewrite it now..."

"But I read all the internal regulations related to elective courses, and I didn’t see any clause about the conditions you mentioned. Are you saying only art scholarship students can choose art elective courses? Which clause should I refer to?"

"What? Are you playing word games with me now?"

Hyunsoo responded with a very innocent face and a polite tone.

"Word games? No. I prepared the plan thoroughly, understanding the regulations to avoid mistakes, and even consulted friends. But being reprimanded now is quite disheartening. I want to avoid such issues in the future."

Only then did Director Soderman realize that Hyunsoo was not an easy student. He remained calm and hit the point.

He controlled his anger and spoke as calmly as he could.

"The relevant clauses are included not only in the elective course section of the regulations but also in various detailed parts. Given the volume of regulations, they are easily overlooked."

"Indeed. I actually read all the regulations, and the clauses related to elective courses were included in 'Scholarship Student's Virtue,' 'General Classes,' and four other sections."

"You read all of them?"

In the US, due to frequent lawsuits, schools prepare regulations as thick as a law book to protect themselves.

Most students use the regulations as a monitor stand due to the detailed contents.

"Yes. I studied them multiple times, so I can remember everything. If it’s a matter of interpretation as you said, I’d like to review the specific clauses in detail if it’s not too much trouble. I’d appreciate it even more if you could personally explain them."

‘He can memorize all of that?’

Director Soderman spoke mockingly.

"Save your bluffs for somewhere else... I will organize and send that part later. Let’s wrap up the regulation talk here..."

"I’m sorry to persist, but I want to appeal my preparation. There are a total of 51 clauses related to elective courses. Clause 1, Section 1 states that a third-year student can apply for one elective course. Exceptionally, if recommended by a teacher or higher, the board can review additional courses. Section 2 is..."

Hyunsoo recited the regulations clearly in front of everyone.

At first, everyone was puzzled by the absurdity, but the smooth delivery, akin to a news anchor, caught the board members' interest, and they looked at the secretary.

The secretary, who had the regulations, quietly nodded after verification.

"It’s accurate. Not a single word is wrong so far."

Realizing it from the confident recitation, they confirmed that he had an extraordinary memory.

"Shall we stop there for now?"

Director Austin Rockwell, who had been observing quietly, stepped in to mediate.

"I think the student has achieved his goal. The effort to memorize is commendable, so there’s no need to recite everything. Let’s just do a simple test."

Director Rockwell asked about sections and clauses from the regulations handed over by the secretary, and Hyunsoo answered them correctly in a testing manner.

"Remarkable. You really memorized everything?"

As time passed, Director Soderman’s face grew more grim.

People were amazed as Hyunsoo read the regulations like an audiobook, even identifying the pages.

Feeling the atmosphere was ripe, Hyunsoo gently suggested to Director Soderman.

"Many scholarship students seem to be confused about the elective course selection. It might be a good opportunity to bring this up in the student council and publicize it. Wouldn’t it help many students if we review the regulations and hear the board’s opinions directly?"

"......."

Director Soderman realized. This cunning student had planned this from the moment the conversation started.

Despite his polite words, he subtly provoked with the expression of attending school for fun.

He merely stated that scholarship students usually choose electives aligned with their specialties, but the conversation made him seem like a villain forcing something against the regulations.

In no time, it became a topic the student council would love. If a public meeting occurred, it would easily become a subject of ridicule among students.

‘Just a few months ago, he couldn’t even express his opinions well... What happened in just one year?’

Director Soderman knew he was at a crossroads.

In a very awkward situation, Director Rockwell handled it skillfully.

"Hahaha. It’s been a while since a student cornered us like this. As expected from Jessie’s student... indeed. I hope you don’t dislike us too much."

"Not at all."

"That’s a relief. Actually, we also have our position to consider. Since the school operates a significant budget, someone has to represent the sponsors rather than the educators."

"I understand."

"Hyunsoo is such an excellent student that he enjoys unprecedented privileges in the school’s history, but naturally, when we invest, we expect results, right? We were hoping you might audit classes at Stanford or even Harvard with transportation support if desired... But taking all three electives in the arts? It’s a bit surprising, isn’t it?"

Hyunsoo understood. But he did not want to take other classes.

‘It’s better to give up electives and switch to general classes. It’s unfortunate but I can find another way.’

Just as he was rekindling his fighting spirit, Director Rockwell made an offer he couldn’t refuse.

At the conference room exit, Jessie was waiting.

Initially, she thought he would come out quickly, but as time passed, she grew worried and waited.

"Puhahaha!"

Walking through the campus, Hyunsoo told her what happened inside, making her laugh until tears welled up.

"I told you to fight if necessary, but you really humiliated Director Soderman. Especially since he’s so petty."

"I never liked him anyway. Last year, he shook my confidence badly, telling me to go back to Korea because my English was poor. He did that almost every quarter."

"Oh... then it’s understandable. But you crushed him with fluent English in just a year. Even native speakers can’t beat that strict Soderman."

After sharing Director Rockwell’s proposal, she asked curiously.

"Wow. As expected from my favorite director. He’s a company representative, so he’s charismatic yet gentle. Don’t you think?"

"He definitely seemed impressive. In that brief moment, he figured out what I really wanted without me showing it."

"The fashion class?"

Hyunsoo nodded.

In fact, the other two classes were somewhat for show.

Since he was allowed three electives, he chose PE because he had to take a joint class, and music because Jessie wanted to take it together.

Fashion was the one elective he absolutely wanted to keep, even if he had to give up the other two, and Director Rockwell saw through that.

"Yeah. I don’t know where he got the hint, but he tempted me with a fashion class. Instead of SAA, he offered to send me to the much more prestigious FIT? He said I could go to New York once a week with my partner, and all necessary expenses would be covered."

"FIT? That FIT???"

Jessie was astonished. Understandably so. FIT is one of the top three fashion schools globally, not just in the US.

Even with Johannes High School’s connections and funds, only truly promising and portfolio-excellent scholarship students are allowed to audit classes there.

Hyunsoo couldn’t possibly meet those strict conditions, implying that Director Rockwell would personally arrange it.

"Under what conditions?"

He awkwardly scratched his head.

"For this semester, I have to join the basketball team. The head coach made a strong request. And being part of the basketball team means I’ll be recognized as an athletic elite, solving the elective issue at once. It’s a solution that satisfies both sides."

"Wow. Truly a Solomon. It’s a bit of a cover-up, but still, it’s something. He’s offering to cover for you. But are you really joining the basketball team? You weren’t interested when the coach called last time."

Hyunsoo shrugged.

"It’s not that I didn’t want to join the basketball team, but I find basketball fun. Besides, knowing about the SAA audit class made me really want to take the fashion class."

"Why? From the way you dress, I thought you had no interest in fashion."

"......."

"Oh, sorry. Did I touch a nerve? Continue with the story. Why fashion in particular?"

"It's because...
