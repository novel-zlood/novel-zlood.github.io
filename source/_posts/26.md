Brahms Violin Sonata No. 3.

*Whirring sound.*

It is raining. The eyes and ears of the audience have long been captivated by her.

Her red dress flutters like a rose. Her bowing is lofty and elegant, like watching a piece of art.

At the moment when the Stradivarius, imbued with moonlight, produces a poignant melody.

A storm rages!

*Boom.*

The pianist's fingers moved fiercely, as if chasing the passionately rising melody.

The left hand, which should play the bass, was no longer obsessed, and the natural movement, like flowing water, created a melancholy melody.

Considering the relatively young age of Baek Jung-hoon, his skill can only be described as genius.

*Whirring sound.*

The Queen of the Strings was smiling. This was because Baek Jung-hoon's performance moved her heart.

Her instrument, Stradivarius, cried out as if resonating with him. As they entered the fourth movement, the violin and piano spat out the language of sound as if envying each other.

The audience felt their hearts pounding violently.

My grandfather tightly held my hand because the turbulent melody poured out roughly through the moonlight.

The audience opened their eyes wide simultaneously.

Even their breathing felt like a sin. The pianist was confronting the violin as if standing at the edge of a cliff.

His eyes, soaked in sadness, represented his heart, and the intense melody made the page turner's face visibly tense.

At the moment when the famous Stradivarius once again burst into a poignant melody, *Boom*, Baek Jung-hoon's fingers began to dance endlessly on the keyboard.

As if it were the last performance of his life.

Even after the solo recital ended, people couldn't easily shake off the lingering emotions.

Suddenly, I remembered the nickname of Baek Jung-hoon from his past life.

‘He’s not called the Iron-Blooded Maestro for nothing.’

He only provided a small clue once, but Baek Jung-hoon made it almost perfect in a short time.

However, the highlight of this recital was undoubtedly the Queen of the Strings. Like a mother comforting a child, the queen embraced Baek Jung-hoon.

“Hyun, Grandpa has never seen anyone play the violin like that.”

Even my grandfather, who had been skilled at hiding his emotions for a long time, couldn't conceal his astonishment.

Though the stage was empty, it felt as if Hirose's bow was still moving. Such an overwhelming stage. It’s no wonder there's a saying that Hirose's melody steals the audience's soul.

“Excuse me.”

At that moment, a mysterious man approached my grandfather and me.

“Hello. I am Hasegawa Goro, currently managing Hirose-san.”

Manager?

“Hirose-san would like to meet you two if you have time. Of course, it would have been better if Hirose-san said it herself, but the audience might crowd too much…”

He bowed deeply, asking almost excessively.

* * *

‘That child has come.’

Hirose couldn't forget the gaze of the child sitting in the audience.

Even though she saw the bow pointing toward her, she didn't feel the slightest tremor. Rather, she quickly turned her gaze away because of the deep eyes that seemed to pierce through her.

It was a feeling she hadn't experienced in a long time. She wanted to run out and stand in front of the child immediately, but couldn't because of the waiting audience.

At that moment.

“Teacher, I am truly sorry.”

Baek Jung-hoon bowed his head to Hirose.

“Why are you saying that? Jung-hoon.”

At Hirose's puzzled question, Baek Jung-hoon raised his head.

“Even though I made mistakes, I didn’t mention them. I was sorry to acknowledge my mistakes in front of you. I sincerely apologize now.”

Hirose smiled and shook her head. The Korean pianist, Baek Jung-hoon, would surely become a leading figure in Asian classical music.

Just from today’s performance, his skills had visibly improved in just a few days. Especially in Brahms' Violin Sonata No. 3, the melody he created gave goosebumps.

“Your interpretation of Brahms' piece was excellent. I think that alone is enough for an apology, don’t you think?”

Baek Jung-hoon's face turned red at the unexpected answer. He hesitated for a moment and then licked his dry lips.

“In fact, there was a child who helped me improve. I don’t know who it is, though.” 

A child?

How could he not know who helped him?

At that moment.

*Knock knock.*

A knocking sound was followed by Goro's voice.

* * *

I expected this.

Baek Jung-hoon's eyes were trembling as if an earthquake had hit them. How could I have known that the pianist in the ramen shop was Baek Jung-hoon? Hirose stood up and greeted my grandfather and me.

“Really nice to meet you, I've wanted to see you for so long, Kang Hyun.”

“No, it’s my honor to meet you.”

I, too, had wanted to meet the Queen of the Strings. In my past life, I was an ardent fan of her.

The red dress that matched her skin tone exuded beauty that made one forget her age.

“I never knew Hyun spoke Japanese this well. Watching your videos repeatedly, it felt like we already knew each other.”

Hirose grabbed my hand and widened her eyes in surprise.

Just like Spencer’s reaction before. She must have been surprised not to find any calluses on my hands.

“It’s really amazing.”

It felt strange. It was like meeting a master who had already passed away in my past life while they were still alive.

“If such a performance were achieved by effort alone, it wouldn’t make sense. Watching your performance, I was captivated. I wanted to fly to Korea several times a day, but I couldn’t due to my solo recital schedule. I am truly grateful you both came to see me like this.”

Hirose’s demeanor was calm and graceful, befitting her nickname, the Queen of the Strings. Even though I was just a child, she treated me with such respect.

“Hyun, do you have a teacher?”

A question asking if I had a formal violin teacher. I hesitated to answer. Although I took music lessons from Park Sun-young, could I call her a musical mentor? Hirose sighed lightly at my hesitation.

“Since you can’t answer easily, can I take it as a no?”

Hirose’s white hair swayed greatly.

“Hyun, would you like to exchange music with me?”

Baek Jung-hoon, who was listening beside me, widened his eyes. He never imagined Hirose would say such a thing.

Moreover, she used the word "exchange" instead of "teaching." Baek Jung-hoon understood the hidden meaning. It meant she acknowledged him as a violinist.

I couldn’t easily answer.

At that moment, I saw the wrinkles around my grandfather’s eyes. It would be a lie to say my heart wasn't moved by her melody. My heart was beating violently.

Seeing me hesitate again, Hirose nodded briefly.

“Hyun, then would you like to play this violin?”

When Hirose handed me her violin case, Baek Jung-hoon and even Goro were agitated. For a violinist, a violin is like their life. Moreover, it was a Stradivarius, which costs as much as a building in downtown Seoul.

*Gulp.*

My trembling gaze fell on the Queen’s violin.

* * *

Warm.

The hot spring water soaked my body warmly.

There was no one in the spacious hot spring except my grandfather and me. Soaking in the warm water, I felt the accumulated fatigue melt away.

My grandfather looked at me curiously as I smiled lazily. “Hyun, do you like the hot spring that much?”

“Yes, hehe.”

My grandfather patted my head once and asked again.

“But why did you refuse Hirose-san’s offer?”

“Huh?”

I wiped my face with my palm and looked at my grandfather. I hadn’t specifically explained what had happened at the Opera City today. Of course, my grandfather didn’t ask, either.

But how?

“You thought your grandpa didn’t understand Japanese?”

Even in the hot bath, I felt goosebumps all over my body. Did he know everything that happened at the ramen shop too?

“Grandpa knows better than anyone that you have exceptional musical talent. So, I was curious why you refused Hirose-san’s offer. She would undoubtedly be someone who could help you the most.”

What should I say?

“Grandpa, you’re getting your health checkups on time, right?”

My sudden question made my grandfather burst into laughter.

“Don’t worry about me, kiddo. I’ll be fine for the next ten years.”

I couldn’t bring myself to tell him he had only five years left. There were too many issues to resolve within that time.

“But why didn’t you play Hirose-san’s violin?”

Stradivarius.

One of the three legendary violins that every violinist dreams of.

It wouldn’t make sense to say I didn’t want to play the Queen’s violin. Its magnetic pull was like a black hole, and my heart pounded like never before. But.

I felt that if I played the violin, I couldn’t return home.

I avoided answering and submerged myself under the water. I could feel my grandfather's gaze, but only random air bubbles appeared on the surface.

“Hello, Baek Jung-hoon.”

Reporter Kim Saet-byeol from DailyQ flew to Japan to interview Baek Jung-hoon, who is considered Korea's next great maestro. Baek Jung-hoon was a standout gem in Korea, a place considered barren for classical music.

“You performed with Hirose-san, a giant in the Japanese music scene. How did it feel? It’s known that you are the youngest pianist to have collaborated with Hirose-san.”

Without hesitation, Baek Jung-hoon answered the reporter’s question.

“It was an honor. Rather than saying we collaborated, it would be more accurate to say I received tutelage. Hirose-sensei is an insurmountable wall for me.”

It wasn’t an exaggerated statement. Knowing Hirose’s global reputation, the reporter nodded without further questioning.

“What are your future plans?”

“After finishing the collaboration with Hirose-sensei, I plan to study abroad. The path of learning has no end.”

The reporter quickly jotted down notes. Most people would think Baek Jung-hoon had connections with other great maestros and wouldn’t expect him to plan for further studies. The reporter looked at Baek Jung-hoon and asked another question.

“According to an interview in Gramophone magazine, Hirose-san highly praised you, saying you will become a maestro who will lead Korea’s classical music in the future. What do you think about that?”

Interest in Baek Jung-hoon was growing in Korea. He had won second place in the Chopin Competition, and even at a young age, his skills were recognized by world-renowned maestros.

It was natural that Korea’s classical music scene would be restructured around Baek Jung-hoon.

However.

Baek Jung-hoon frowned. A habit that appeared whenever he was deep in thought.

A maestro who will lead Korea’s classical music,

Nonsense. But one thing was certain.

“Korea’s classical music will undergo significant changes.”

A boy naturally came to Baek Jung-hoon’s mind. The boy whom Hirose-sensei looked at with longing eyes and who filled Baek Jung-hoon’s eyes with admiration.
