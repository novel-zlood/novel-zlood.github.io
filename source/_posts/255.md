"Sorry for not recognizing you. I'm Kang Hyun."

It was impossible to know the names and faces of all the great masters in the world. Viktor scrutinized Kang Hyun from head to toe with a hawk-like gaze and then spoke.

"You look much younger than I heard."

Why is the first impression of everyone from Russia so similar? Viktor was glaring at Kang Hyun with a mean look, almost like a thug. Was he trying to pick a fight?

Instead, Kang Hyun smiled faintly. There was no need to waste energy here.

"Thank you."

"Ahem."

At the unexpected response, Viktor cleared his throat and turned away.

"Hyun, shall we go then?"

"Yes, sir."

With Hirose's escort, they started walking. Amusingly, two vehicles were prepared, and Viktor, as if it were prearranged, got into one alone. It was puzzling why he had come to greet them in the first place if he was going to do this.

At that moment, as if reading Kang Hyun's thoughts, Hirose spoke.

"Hyun, among the judges, there were some who welcomed your invitation, but there were also those who didn't. Viktor's opposition was particularly strong. He is a very conservative person. No matter how outstanding Hyun's skills are, he won't believe it unless he sees it with his own eyes. He probably thinks Hyun's reputation is exaggerated."

It was as expected. In a way, it was natural. All the judges, except for Kang Hyun, were middle-aged or older. As judges, they needed not only discernment but also experience and maturity. From that perspective, Kang Hyun was objectively very young.

Since Viktor had stepped aside, Kang Hyun asked a question he had been holding.

"Mr. Hirose, to be honest, I have been curious since before coming here. You said you recommended me as the last judge for the Queen Elisabeth competition. I'm curious about the reason."

"The reason..."

Hirose paused, as if the question was unexpected, and then began.

"Is it necessary to explain?"

What did he mean by that?

"Hyun is already recognized worldwide as a virtuoso and maestro. If you can't sit as a judge just because you're young, our classical world won't progress. Everyone says they want the next Mozart or Beethoven, but conservative culture is still deeply rooted. I've always wanted to break that culture. Perhaps Hyun will play the role of breaking the ground."

Only then could Kang Hyun understand why Hirose had called him to Queen Elisabeth. Hirose then added something incomprehensible.

"And it wasn't I who called you, Hyun."

"What? But you said you recommended me."

"That's what is publicly known, but it's not true."

Kang Hyun wanted to ask who recommended him, but Hirose didn't seem inclined to say more. Meanwhile, the car left the airport and headed towards the center of Brussels.

* * *

"Hyun!"

It was a restaurant located in the center of Brussels. The other judges, except for Hirose and Viktor, had already gathered and were waiting for Hyun.

Although most of them were meeting for the first time, Deng Lun, who had previously served as a judge for the Queen Elisabeth competition, stood up and greeted Kang Hyun warmly.

"It's been a long time. It's quite emotional to see how much you've grown."

Deng Lun treated Kang Hyun like a kindly grandfather. The other masters' eyes were full of curiosity.

It was natural because Kang Hyun was a figure currently stirring up the classical world. Especially, the French master Hugo constantly asked questions to Kang Hyun.

"Hyun, do you mean to say you didn't get any advice from anyone when composing the symphony?"

"Yes, that's correct."

"Huh!"

Even Hugo and Deng Lun were looking at Kang Hyun with surprised eyes. They already knew he composed alone, but they never imagined he had composed the symphony, known as an epic, without anyone's help.

Kang Hyun's symphonies all had unique structures and storytelling. Even those who had been in music for decades couldn't easily judge his scores. At that moment.

"What's so great about that?" Viktor said, placing his wine glass loudly on the table, his nose red like a well-ripened persimmon. He seemed to be quite tipsy.

"Haven't we all been composing for a long time?"

"Viktor, the pieces we composed and Hyun's symphony are on different levels."

"Do you really think that? To me, it looks like the media is overhyping it. Who knows, in today's world, money can do anything. Who's to say the Billboard chart wasn't bought?"

Kang Hyun chuckled at Viktor's grumbling. If Viktor had been in his twenties instead of middle-aged, Kang Hyun would have smacked him right then and there.

At that moment, the French master Hugo frowned and looked at Viktor.

"Viktor, you seem quite drunk today. Perhaps you should head to the hotel and rest."

Despite Hugo's words, Viktor showed no signs of getting up. Instead, he sipped his wine.

Kang Hyun shook his head. There was no point in arguing with someone who was severely drunk. As the saying goes, avoiding trouble because it's dirty.

"No, I'll get up first. I'm actually quite tired from the long flight."

"Hyun, you're getting up first? Oh my."

Hugo glared at Viktor and then turned his head. Just then, Viktor sneered at Hyun who was about to get up.

"It's surprising to see such a young brat leave first when no one else has. You live long enough, you'll see everything."

Even as Viktor sneered, Kang Hyun let it go in one ear and out the other. He couldn't get angry in front of Hirose-sensei.

At that moment, Viktor, seeing Hyun's nonchalant attitude, got agitated and added.

"Let's ask Alexei if this kid is really fit to be a judge for the Queen Elisabeth competition."

"Viktor!" Hugo shouted, but Viktor was already pressing buttons on his phone. Kang Hyun shook his head again. It didn't seem like his days in Brussels would be smooth.

* * *

Viktor licked his dry lips. Just thinking about that kid deepened his frown lines. He hadn't liked him from the first meeting. The boy, who looked almost like a girl, did nothing but annoying things.

"No matter how I see it, he's not judge material."

Viktor trusted his own judgment. How many years had he been playing the violin? Longer than that brat had been alive.

"Billboard chart?"

Ridiculous. What's so noteworthy about being on the Billboard chart? Since when did classical music bow to commercialism? It was exasperating.

No matter how successful the New York performance had been, it was just a fleeting trend. There was no guarantee the brat's popularity would last ten or twenty years.

"Why did Alexei have to say such things in that place!"

Who would have thought Alexei, whom he trusted, would praise the boy so highly?

It was clear that Alexei's personality had softened over the years. Of course, he was now the head of the Moscow Conservatory. Teaching students must have made him gentle and soft.

"Tsk."

He wanted to embarrass the brat somehow, but there was no way. The other judges, including China's Deng Lun, were all protective of the brat.

Especially Japan's Hirose was a sight to behold, acting like the brat's mentor. Just then.

"Sir, today is the day for the tape auditions."

At the sound of a knock, a voice from the Queen Elisabeth staff was heard. The tape auditions involved selecting participants from around the world based on their tapes. The number was so overwhelming that the judges formed pairs to watch the tapes.

"Who will be with me today?"

At Viktor's question, the staff seemed to look at some documents and then answered.

"Violinist Hyun."

A slight smile appeared on Viktor's lips. Fine, let's see how discerning you are.

* * *

Rustle.

It was when Kang Hyun, fresh out of the shower, was wrapping a towel around his neck. He felt his ears itching again. Surely, someone was cursing him. There was a suspect, but what could he do? Just then.

"Hyun, today is the day for the tape auditions."

Eva, a Queen Elisabeth staff member, personally came to deliver the schedule. Perhaps because of their connection from seven years ago in Brussels, it wasn't awkward with Eva.

"Eva, who is the judge I'll be paired with?"

He hoped it would be either Hirose or Deng Lun. Even judges have their opinions, and he didn't want to argue with someone he didn't get along with.

At that moment, Eva hesitated and spoke.

"It's Viktor-sensei."

A look of disappointment briefly crossed Kang Hyun's face but quickly disappeared.

It was already a done deal. Even if he didn't like it, he would have to keep meeting the man while serving as a judge.

Better to get it over with and see for himself how discerning Viktor was.

He arrived at the location for the tape auditions. Viktor was already there, sipping tea, and didn't even acknowledge Kang Hyun's greeting.

'He's not a child.'

Ignoring Viktor's cold shoulder, Kang Hyun took his seat. As soon as he sat down, Eva brought refreshments and tea.

The purpose of the tape auditions was simple. It was to select violinists from thousands of applicants worldwide. The judges had to form teams and evaluate hundreds of tapes. It wasn't possible to watch all the tapes, which ranged from three to ten minutes long.

"Rejected."

"Rejected."

By just looking at their posture and the depth of their melodies, one could tell if the performer was a genuine violinist. Viktor, as expected, was not someone who earned his reputation for nothing. His discernment was impressive. Kang Hyun wondered if he had worried for nothing.

"Accepted."

"Accepted."

Their opinions continued to align perfectly. Viktor glanced at Hyun with a look of surprise.

Normally, judges might share their reasons for rejection, but the two only spoke the words "accepted" or "rejected."

To an outsider, it might seem as if they had coordinated their responses for an hour.

Then, a young male student appeared on the video, and Viktor furrowed his brow and shook his head.

"Rejected."

But Kang Hyun felt differently.

"Accepted."

It was the first time their opinions clashed.
