## Episode 61: Press Conference

The moment Lee Chang-jin, wearing sunglasses, got out of the car at GM Records, flashes went off everywhere.

"Mr. Lee Chang-jin, are the recent rumors circulating true?"

"How do you plan to explain the allegations of tax evasion and patent infringement?"

"Please say a word before you go in, President Lee."

"First of all, I apologize for causing any trouble. However, the rumors circulating are not true."

"What do you mean? Isn't it true that you clearly infringed on a patent?"

"If you didn't infringe on the patent, how did you develop the Italian towel?"

"There was also controversy regarding the crane production last time. There was testimony from Mido Machinery that they had no choice but to step back due to unfair external pressure. Please clarify this opportunity."

Despite the barrage of questions, Lee Chang-jin kept his mouth shut and headed towards the conference room.

Lee Chang-jin calmly spoke into the microphone after stepping onto the podium.

"I have never infringed on the patent of Taebang Textiles, which was recently reported in the media. Also, I have never done anything shameful in my business career. Instead of explaining with words, I think evidence is necessary, so I will reveal it here at the press conference."

"Evidence?"

"Are you saying you have some kind of evidence?"

Lee Chang-jin held the microphone and spoke softly amidst the persistent questioning of the reporters.

"I would like to take this moment to introduce someone. President Hwang Cheol-gwan, please come up."

As soon as he finished speaking, Hwang Cheol-gwan, holding a framed certificate, confidently walked out from the emergency exit.

As Hwang Cheol-gwan walked forward, all the reporters turned their attention to him.

The frame contained none other than a patent certificate.

Kim Tae-bang had attended this press conference on purpose. He wanted to see how Lee Chang-jin would respond and to prove his own innocence. He had also prepared a set of questions in advance in case the reporters failed to ask properly.

But this situation was entirely unexpected.

Kim Tae-bang's face, which had been confident until now, turned pale at the sight of Hwang Cheol-gwan.

Muttering in a trembling voice, Kim Tae-bang looked like he had seen a ghost.

"Hwa... President Hwang, you're still alive...?"

No more words followed. Hwang Cheol-gwan had stepped onto the stage.

"I am Hwang Cheol-gwan."

Lee Chang-jin introduced Hwang Cheol-gwan, who had come up to the podium. Holding the framed certificate, Lee Chang-jin showed it to the reporters and continued.

"President Hwang Cheol-gwan here is the actual developer of the Italian towel. The utility model patent is registered not under President Kim Tae-bang of Taebang Textiles but under President Hwang Cheol-gwan. Therefore, the party that actually infringed on the patent is not Daese Group but rather Taebang Textiles."

The sudden bombshell statement caused the reporters to buzz with excitement. Flashes from photographers went off everywhere. Kim Tae-bang, sweating profusely, rolled his eyes, looking lost and not knowing what to do. Hwang Cheol-gwan, who had received the microphone from Lee Chang-jin, spoke in a deep voice, drawing attention.

"I will personally explain the circumstances that have transpired."

Hwang Cheol-gwan, standing on the stage, explained the events that had occurred. He recounted the process of developing the Italian towel, how his company burned down after starting operations, losing all his assets, and how he got involved in legal disputes when an employee embezzled company funds.

"President Hwang, more than 10 years have passed since the patent was registered. It will expire next year. If all this is true, why have you kept it hidden until now?"

"If you ask why, I can only tell you the truth. After my business failed, my health deteriorated, and I spent nearly seven years battling cancer. During that time, I was constantly on the brink of death, undergoing numerous surgeries to remove parts of my stomach to survive. Fortunately, thanks to a stroke of luck, the chemotherapy succeeded, and I survived."

When Hwang Cheol-gwan lifted his shirt, a gruesome scar was revealed. While the cameramen took a flurry of photos, Joo Young-mi, a reporter sitting in the front row, asked a question.

"President, why are you revealing this now?"

"At the time, my life was on the line, and I had no reason to concern myself with other matters. I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to let society benefit from a patent I couldn't use anyway. However, fabricating the truth and maliciously slandering Daese Group despite me being the patent holder was something I could not tolerate. That's why I am here today. Moreover, I have learned new facts about President Kim Tae-bang."

Pointing at Kim Tae-bang, Hwang Cheol-gwan asked.

"Tae-bang, I thought of you as a friend, but it turns out you orchestrated all of this behind my back to take over my business. I need to know why. Why did you do this to me?"

As the cameras, which had been focused on the stage, turned to Kim Tae-bang, he became utterly flustered. Realizing the situation, officials from Taebang Textiles waved their hands and shouted angrily.

"Stop taking pictures! It's an invasion of privacy!"

Surrounded by bodyguards, President Kim Tae-bang hurriedly left the press conference.

Back on stage, Lee Chang-jin spoke up again.

"Reporters, you can verify the facts with the Patent Office. By the way, I will take legal action against the media outlets and journalists who have defamed me and Daese Group with malicious articles, causing both tangible and intangible damage. This concludes the press conference."

As soon as Lee Chang-jin finished speaking, the cameras started rolling. Reporters who had published false articles looked visibly distressed under the flashing lights.

With the situation unfolding as it did, there was no way for them to avoid responsibility.

Daese Group employees surrounded Lee Chang-jin protectively and headed to the vehicle.

As the incident grew larger, the chief editor of Hansung Daily visited the office to manage the situation.

"President Lee Chang-jin, we made a mistake this time. While we strive for the public good, mistakes sometimes occur in the process of handling articles. The reporters were overzealous. We ask for your understanding."

"So, what do you propose to do?"

"How about we settle this by publishing a correction article? We also have our reputation to consider, so please give us the opportunity to withdraw honorably."

"Are you asking me to withdraw my legal actions?"

"In a manner of speaking, yes. There's no point in wasting energy on a legal battle. We can place advertisements for you and provide appropriate compensation within reasonable limits, so let's settle this. There's no good in harming each other when we're all just trying to make a living."

"I'm sorry, but I have no intention of compromising at that level. And I must say, your statement has serious flaws. You call it a mistake, but from my perspective, it's hard to accept."

"What do you mean, Mr. Lee?"

Raising his eyebrows, the chief editor looked at Lee Chang-jin, who handed him a prepared envelope.

"If you can still say the same thing after seeing this, I will agree with you."

Inside the envelope were photos of Hansung Daily reporters, including Reporter Ha, taken with Kim Tae-bang. The photos showed them enjoying drinks and entertainment with courtesans, some almost naked, and receiving envelopes of money from Kim Tae-bang.

The chief editor, stunned by the explicit photos, was at a loss for words.

"How did this... Where did you get these?"

"Does it matter? What's important is that they are in my possession. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your proposal. What I want is a sincere apology and earnest effort. Ah, here's a recording file as well. Would you like to listen to it?"

Lee Chang-jin took out a recorder from his pocket. When he played the recording, the conversation between Kim Tae-bang and the reporters could be heard.

"I also have additional materials. Reporter Ha seemed to have quite a wide network."

"Are you threatening me? Do you think you can take down Hansung Daily with just this?"

"Of course not. How could a small company like ours take on a giant media outlet like Hansung Daily? I'm just letting you know that we have options. If this material is made public, it will significantly damage the credibility of your media company. What will you do? If you refuse, we have no other recourse."

The trembling chief editor glared at Lee Chang-jin. After a moment of silence, the chief editor finally lowered his head.

"What do you want?"

"Please publish an apology on the front page of the morning edition of Hansung Daily. I understand that Hansung Daily is affiliated with Hansung Broadcasting. If possible, please air an apology broadcast before the 9 o'clock news. As for Reporter Ha, I regret to say that I have no intention of withdrawing legal action. Please impose appropriate disciplinary measures. If you do this, I will not pursue additional civil damages against the media company."

"Alright. I will report your request to the higher-ups and try to accommodate it. It will take a few days for the final notice, so please refrain from any additional media play until we make the announcement."

"That's agreeable. I look forward to working with you."

Lee Chang-jin extended his hand for a handshake with a faint smile.

The chief editor, forcing a bitter smile, extended his hand in return.

"Lee Chang-jin, right? I'll remember that name."

"I'll remember you too, Chief Editor Seok Joo-hyun."

Two days after meeting the chief editor, an apology and correction were published on the front page of Hansung Daily. That evening, Jin Tae-chun, watching the 9 o'clock news in the living room, smiled deeply.

"Ha, that guy's something else. I thought he was just a nerd, but he's quite capable of fighting dirty. Don't you think?"

"Of course. Who do you think our lady takes after? She wouldn't be with someone with no eye for men."

The housekeeper, peeling an apple, handed a fork with a piece of fruit to Tae-chun. Tae-chun, biting into the nicely carved, rabbit-shaped apple, continued.

"What do you think of him? He's quite good, isn't he?"

"Absolutely. You don't find men like him often. If I were 10 years younger, I'd try to woo him myself. Hoho."

"Indeed. This one does seem different."

Having met many men, none had satisfied Tae-chun's high standards.

But this time, the feeling was different.

"Top of his class at Korea University... I should set a date to meet him."

With a hint of anticipation, Tae-chun finished the remaining apple.
