## Episode 52: Group Interview

The area in front of the mailbox was filled with an enormous amount of mail. The company's office was equally crowded with applicants, making it almost impossible to move.

Goo Chang-dong, who was checking the number of submitted applications, exclaimed excitedly.

"Boss, this is madness. There are way more applicants than we expected."

"Really? How many are there?"

"Don't be surprised. There are over 2,000 applicants."

Even though it was a recruitment for experienced workers and no separate job fair had been held at universities, the number was still that high. Was it the power of media promotion? For Lee Chang-jin, who considered 200 applicants a success, this was an astonishing number.

'I didn't expect people to be this enthusiastic.'

Lee Chang-jin was also greatly encouraged by the unexpected results. After a while, Goo, who had calmed down a bit, spoke.

"But what should we do? We're only hiring about 30 people at most... With so many, even reviewing the documents will be a huge task."

"Hmm, there's no helping it. Assistant Yeo and Manager Goo, please put other tasks on hold and help with sorting the applications. There are copies of the manual on the desk, just follow them exactly."

"Yes, understood."

Reviewing over 2,000 applications was a massive task. While one team sorted them by specifications and experience, the other team continuously handed over the applications organized in order of receipt to Lee Chang-jin.

Lee Chang-jin boldly discarded applications that seemed insincere or had copied phrases. On the other hand, he carefully read through applications that showed sincerity, even if the applicant's specifications were somewhat lacking. As Goo Chang-dong mechanically sorted through the documents, he mumbled with a hint of concern.

"This person has decent experience but hasn't stayed long at any one place. Worked at Taejin for a year, Osung for three years, Mirae for two years. But despite the high seniority, the rank is low. The school is good too, so why is that?"

"Put those on hold for now. If a physically able person has been repeatedly overlooked for promotions, there might be an issue with their skills or personality. Better to hire a newbie than someone mediocre. People who know just enough are harder to teach."

While experience was important, passion and sincerity were the top priorities. The main goal was to hire someone who would grow with the company.

Suddenly, Yeo Jin-joo, who was flipping through the documents, made an interesting expression.

"Oh, look at this. This person has a master's degree from Hanguk University? They joined Mirae Group during their Ph.D. program."

Goo Chang-dong asked in surprise.

"A master's from Hanguk University? Is that for real?"

"Yes. They were specially recruited by Mirae Group from Hanguk University's engineering school. It seems they were going to become a professor but changed their direction. Their experience is very unique."

Upon reading the detailed application, the grades were decent, and they had a significant number of awards. They had consistently won awards in mechanical competitions since high school. Goo Chang-dong, who was curiously flipping through the documents, tilted his head in amazement.

"Even their motivation for applying is unique. They applied because they wanted to handle machines directly..."

Another notable point was that the Hanguk University graduate had served as a non-commissioned officer in the Air Force maintenance depot.

Lee Chang-jin, who was reviewing the application, asked again.

"Are there any other applicants from Hanguk University?"

"Yes, there seem to be about a dozen. But most of them have less than two years of practical experience. Most of the applicants with less practical experience are classified in group 2."

Applicants who passed the document screening were classified into group 1, and those who were somewhat ambiguous were classified into group 2.

Lee Chang-jin would decide on the group 2 applicants by looking at their motivations.

After pondering for a while, Lee Chang-jin circled a checkbox.

"For now, this person passes. Pay close attention to them during the interview."

"Yes, understood."

While reviewing the applications tirelessly, evening had already passed.

As they started to get hungry, food arrived at the company. While eating dumplings with the gathered employees, the phone rang.

Yeo Jin-joo, who hurriedly answered the phone, carefully handed it over.

"Boss, it's a call from your father."

"My father?"

Wiping the oil off his lips, Lee Chang-jin picked up the phone and heard a familiar voice.

"Hey, my son. Are you busy these days?"

"Yes, father. I'm sorry. I've been so busy that I haven't been able to contact you."

"It's fine. I saw the article in the Gyeong-un Daily. Well done, my son. Thanks to you, I'm holding my head high in the neighborhood these days and really enjoying life."

"It's nothing. Have you been taking the joint pain medication I sent you? It's a special prescription from a well-known doctor here, so don't forget to take it on time."

"Of course. I've been taking it every day, so don't worry. Is it because of the medicine? I've been feeling very energetic these days."

"Haha, that's good to hear. Don't overdo it, and let me know if you need anything else."

"Ah, I was planning to talk to you about Chang-sik."

"Chang-sik? Is there something wrong?"

"I heard you helped Dong-geun set up a poultry association? Uncle Dong-sik was praising him to no end, saying he was proud of Dong-geun being the chairman. I understand because Dong-geun is a diligent guy, but have you forgotten about your brother?"

Feeling a twinge of guilt, Lee Chang-jin asked cautiously.

"Is Chang-sik very upset about it?"

"Hey, kid. Do you think he would say that? He's the type to keep it to himself and suffer silently. So, I was wondering if you could give him a chance for the overseas training you're offering to the new recruits. Even though he dropped out, he did attend an engineering school."

Lee Chang-jin replied seriously.

"I'm sorry, father, but that's difficult. There are principles in hiring, and even I, as the president, cannot arbitrarily break them. Moreover, this recruitment is not just for regular new hires but for experienced positions. It's a process to select talents for overseas training, so we can't just hire anyone."

"I know, I know. Business isn't a joke. But he's your brother. Blood is thicker than water, right? He's capable, just hasn't had the chance. He's your brother, after all. Just give him one chance."

After contemplating for a moment, Lee Chang-jin nodded.

"Alright. Tell him to submit his application first."

"Got it. I'll make sure he sends it by express mail right away. If needed, I'll drag him by the collar to Seoul, so don't worry."

"Take your time. There's plenty of time until the deadline."

Lee Chang-jin chuckled at his father's hurried tone, understanding his feelings completely. Fortunately, his brother's application arrived on time. The content of the self-introduction was filled with sincerity, as if it had been revised numerous times.

'This guy, at least heâ€™s determined to join.'

Lee Chang-jin, after confirming the format, discreetly slipped the application into the pile of group 1 applications.

It took three full days to finish the document screening.

The number of people who passed the screening was 300, ten times the number of final hires.

Goo Chang-dong, exhausted by the task, sighed deeply.

"Sigh, it took so long just for the document screening, and we still have a long way to go. Conducting the interviews is going to be hell."

"It's too many to handle in one day. We'll probably need a few days."

Agreeing with Yeo Jin-joo, Lee Chang-jin shook his head and replied.

"We can't hastily conduct the interviews for the first batch of recruits. We'll carry out a 2-night, 3-day group interview at a local youth hostel."

"Excuse me? A group interview? Are you saying we'll conduct a group interview before even selecting the hires?"

"Yes. During interviews, each applicant gets only about 10 minutes, which is hardly enough time to assess them. On the other hand, living together for a short period allows us to get to know the applicants better, including their daily habits and attitudes. We can also gauge how passionate and determined they are about the job."

Yeo Jin-joo, who was listening quietly, expressed her concern.

"Boss, the idea is good, but it will take a lot of time and money. If we pull out the necessary personnel for the interviews, the operation will inevitably be delayed."

Indeed, moving and managing 300 applicants while providing accommodation and meals was no easy task. Additionally, the cost would be a significant burden for the company.

But Lee Chang-jin had already anticipated that.

"We can't avoid that. I believe this interview is that important. Talents are the future of the company. We're not working together for just a day or two. If we think of this as an opportunity to select talents who will dedicate their lives to the company, it's not something to be stingy about."

Lee Chang-jin deliberately scheduled the interview to coincide with the interview schedules of Taeyang Group and Anyang Steel. It was a strategy to filter out those who had other options. The applicants, who were initially delighted to pass the document screening, were shocked by the unheard-of group interview format.

"What? A group interview? And it lasts for 2 nights and 3 days? Unbelievable."

"Is this company a boot camp or something?"

The unprecedented group interview was indeed shocking. While new hires at large corporations or public companies sometimes go through training programs, no one had ever heard of a group interview.

Job seekers, facing overlapping interview schedules with other companies, were understandably frustrated. However, Lee Chang-jin pushed ahead with the schedule.

"Those who choose a company based solely on current conditions will eventually go to a company with better conditions. We can't work with employees who don't grow with us. They will leave for a better place as soon as they get the chance."

Lee Chang-jin rented a training center in Chungju for the interview.

At 6:30 a.m., a chartered bus headed to the Chungju training center.

On the bus, Goo Chang-dong greeted them briefly.

"Hello, I am Manager Goo Chang-dong from the headquarters. There are kimbap and water prepared in the front row seats, so please take one each. From the moment you board the bus until the end, consider everything part of the interview. Good luck."

Upon arrival at the training center, the applicants were randomly assigned to groups. They were given time to talk among themselves and select a team leader without any involvement from the interviewers.

"Attention all applicants. We will conduct a simple test. Please proceed to the first-floor meeting room."

After being guided to the meeting room, an aptitude test lasting about two hours was conducted. The questions were ones that Lee Chang-jin had carefully crafted, staying up all night. After the test, a physical fitness test was immediately conducted. It included basic tests like running, push-ups, and sit-ups.

By the time the tests were over, it was already past noon. One applicant, unable to hold back, complained.

"Excuse me, we're hungry. Aren't we going to eat?"

Goo Chang-dong responded as if he had been waiting for this.

"Haha. Don't worry. The preparations are just finished, so we'll enter in order. Follow the instructions and serve yourselves when you reach the dining hall."

As they finished the physical fitness tests and arrived at the dining hall, they found three types of cuisine: Korean, Western, and Chinese, along with cakes, snacks, and drinks. The large steaks and the finest tuna sashimi, as well as various fresh seafood dishes, were piled up like mountains. The applicants' faces lit up with joy.

"This is amazing. They really put effort into this."

"The meat melts in your mouth."

The applicants were in awe of the lavishly decorated dining hall, feeling like they were in a high-end hotel. In fact, these exquisite dishes were specially ordered by Lee Chang-jin, who had invited a head chef from a large hotel he had connections with during his time at Mannheim.

A notice at the entrance of the dining hall asked for voluntary cooperation in cleaning up after the meal.

After the meal, there was a break. During this time, individuals voluntarily helped with bathroom cleaning, trash collection, and food waste disposal.

After about a two-hour break, the group activities began in earnest. The applicants were given tasks related to the company's current issues and asked to discuss solutions. Each group was given an equal opportunity to present their opinions.

The discussions continued late into the night under the theme of the company's growth plans and personal development. The dinner was not a buffet but a course meal. Finally, time was given for preparing presentations. Team presentations continued until late, and they went to bed around 2 a.m., only to wake up at 5:30 a.m.

After an early morning hike, a simple brunch was served. After the hike, there was time for individual interviews.

After lunch, around 4 p.m., the applicants who had gathered in Chungju took the bus back to Chungju. Lee Chang-jin handed out envelopes to each of them.

"Thank you for participating today. We will provide 5,000 won each for transportation and interview expenses."

Lee Chang-jin focused on the applicants' adaptability and teamwork. Those who got along well with their peers and showed a spirit of sacrifice received good scores. The evaluators' opinions were generally similar in the comprehensive evaluation of the applicants. Goo Chang-dong shared his observations.

"Among the presenters, there were a few who showed consideration for their colleagues and took the initiative even when not being watched."

Agreeing with him, Yeo Jin-joo nodded.

"I was also impressed by those who stayed behind to clean up while others went to the shower rooms."

In the group activities, the focus was on evaluating job performance. They observed how each applicant handled trial and error, the ideas they presented, and their problem-solving abilities. They also carefully monitored how thoroughly each applicant cleaned. This process revealed the applicants' sociability, teamwork, consideration, and passion.

It took about a week for the interview results to be finalized.

The employees involved in the evaluation worked through the night to get the results.

Those who passed the group interview had a final one-on-one meeting with President Lee Chang-jin.

As the nervous applicants waited silently in front of the president's office, Yeo Jin-joo's voice was heard.

"Number 62, please come in."

A man with round glasses entered the room. It was Yoon Jung-pil, the person Lee Chang-jin had noted during the document screening. Lee Chang-jin nonchalantly reviewed the documents.

"Mr. Yoon Jung-pil, I see you worked at the Air Force maintenance depot for two years and the planning department at Mirae Group for over three years."

After flipping through the documents, Lee Chang-jin asked the question that had been on his mind.

"With your academic background from Hanguk University and your experience in the planning department, you were almost guaranteed a managerial position. Why did you apply here? Our company may not be bad, but compared to large corporations, our benefits and salaries are lacking."

Hanguk University is universally recognized as the top university in Korea. Especially, the engineering school of Hanguk University was often more prestigious than medical schools in Seoul. A person who dropped out of a Ph.D. program from Hanguk University's engineering school had a rare background even in large corporations and was likely to become an executive wherever they went.

So, it was puzzling why someone with such a promising future would apply to a small company like this.

Yoon Jung-pil answered confidently.

"This is the company that developed the vacuum dryer, right? I felt that other places would only put me in a managerial role, but here I would be able to learn on the ground rather than from a desk. That's why I applied."

Seeing the enthusiasm of a hardcore machine enthusiast, Lee Chang-jin looked at his face again.

His eyes were clear and earnest, making it hard to believe he was lying.

Lee Chang-jin asked in a softer tone.

"Alright. However, you have little practical experience. Can you really learn all the machinery assembly and maintenance work within the given time? The training process is tougher than you might expect."

Learning technical skills in a short period requires considerable perseverance. Yoon Jung-pil replied firmly to Lee Chang-jin's words.

"I can do it. I learned the basics while working at the maintenance depot."

"Okay. But there's one thing you must remember. Our company has a mandatory clause regarding overseas training. Are you aware that overseas trainees are required to work for at least 10 years? If you leave the company for unavoidable reasons, you must repay the training costs without exception. Also, you cannot work in the same industry for three years."

This was a safety measure to prevent technology leaks, but for a promising talent, it was not an easy decision to be bound to a small company with an uncertain future. However, Yoon Jung-pil did not hesitate.

"Don't worry. If I had any doubts, I wouldn't have come here. If you hire me, I'll work with the determination to dedicate my life to this company."

"Alright... But what will you do if you don't get hired here?"

"Well, then I'll reapply. As I showed during the interview, I'm confident in my cleaning skills. If necessary, I'll work as a janitor for the company."

Lee Chang-jin's lips curled slightly at Yoon Jung-pil's answer.

After checking his wristwatch, Lee Chang-jin said.

"The interview is over. You may go."

As he watched Yoon Jung-pil leave, Lee Chang-jin smiled inwardly.

'It's been a while since we've had someone this good.'

In fact, in his previous life, Yoon Jung-pil would leave Mirae Group about five years later and join Taeyang Group. There, he would be specially promoted to department head and lead the research and development department. He would later become the president of Taeyang Electronics, proving his undeniable talent.

After marking the checklist, Lee Chang-jin reviewed the next document. Seeing the name on the document, he smiled. It was his brother Chang-sik's name.

Lee Chang-jin had deliberately not participated in the group interview to avoid any bias. He had not given any hints, so the decision was entirely based on the practical team's judgment.

Chang-sik had made it on his own merit.

"Alright, next person, please come in."

Three days later, Yoon Jung-pil was proudly selected as the top candidate.
