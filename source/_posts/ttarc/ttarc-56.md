## Episode 56: The Magic of Language

She waved her hand.

"Changjin-ssi? You came faster than I expected."

"How could you hang up the phone like that?"

"I did it on purpose to make you come quickly. You said you didn't even have lunch, right? If worrying could solve problems, there wouldn't be any unsolved issues in the world. The best thing to do at times like this is to get some fresh air. By the way, how do I look? I put a lot of effort into my outfit today."

Seeing Jin Seon-ah twirl proudly, Lee Chang-jin felt his cluttered mind clear up a bit.

Indeed, thinking about the Daese Group for almost a week straight was bound to give him a headache.

With that thought, Lee Chang-jin asked Jin Seon-ah,

"By the way, you said it was a meeting, a board meeting, but why are we the only ones here?"

"That's just a coincidence. Dong-geun-ssi is too busy to attend. Don't worry, I have his proxy. First, let's get some lunch. What do you want to eat?"

"Let's look around and decide."

"Sounds good. Follow me."

Jin Seon-ah smiled sweetly and led the way. The sight of a young, sophisticated beauty walking around the market drew attention. Some men blatantly ogled, but because she was with Lee Chang-jin, no one dared to approach.

Walking alongside her, Lee Chang-jin asked,

"Is today a special day? People keep staring. Doesn't it bother you?"

"Not really... It happens often. Being pretty is a crime, you know. It was worse when I was in school."

Jin Seon-ah didn't seem to mind at all.

"But you seem familiar with this place. Have you been here often?"

"I know this area very well. I used to come here often holding my mom's hand."

"Really? That's unexpected."

"What's unexpected?"

"It doesn't match your image at all."

Jin Seon-ah chuckled.

"Am I not a person? I don't come often, just occasionally. I even have a regular vendor here. The fruit from her stall is really delicious."

"A regular?"

"Yes, when I was young, I almost got kidnapped. A market lady here saved me."

It was the first time he had heard this. As they entered the market, they saw various street foods like fried dough twists, steamed buns, blood sausages, and fried snacks. Lee Chang-jin bought a hotteok, golden brown and crispy.

While exploring the market with the hotteok wrapped in paper, Jin Seon-ah tugged on Lee Chang-jin's arm.

"Over there. That's where I almost got lost..."

They stopped in front of a shabby fruit stall. A curly-haired lady was selling her goods. Jin Seon-ah approached her warmly.

"Ajumma, I'm here!"

"Oh my, Seon-ah, you're here? Look at you, you've become even prettier."

"Ajumma, how have you been?"

"I've been fine. But who is this man next to you? I haven't seen him before. Who is he?"

"Oh, he's my boyfriend. Handsome, right?"

"Hello, I'm Lee Chang-jin."

Seizing the opportunity, Lee Chang-jin bowed politely.

The curly-haired market lady looked at Lee Chang-jin with surprise.

"A boyfriend? He looks decent, but what's important is if he can support a woman. Does he have the capability?"

Jin Seon-ah muttered meaningfully,

"Hmm... I'm not sure, but for now, he passes."

"Oh, really? That's a generous evaluation. Isn't Seon-ah's standard high?"

"It's not that high. This guy is the president of a well-known industrial company. Daese Industries. Haven't you seen it in the newspapers? They even exhibited at international fairs."

"A young man is already a president? Impressive. By the way, Changjin-ssi, don't let your guard down just because you think you've caught the fish. If you daze off, someone else might snatch her away. This lady is very popular."

"Haha, I'll keep that in mind."

Jin Seon-ah scowled at the lady's words.

"Ajumma, seriously... Am I a fish to be caught and released? Stop talking nonsense and pack some apples and pears."

"Sorry, sorry. You want the usual amount, right? How many should I pack?"

"Just four of each, but make sure they're good ones."

"Got it. Since your boyfriend is here, I'll pack bigger and sweeter ones."

"Ajumma, thank you."

Lee Chang-jin took the paper bag full of fruits.

"Here, let me carry that. It's heavy."

The bag of fruits seemed to weigh at least 10kg.

"I picked only the best ones. Young president, come by often. I'll give you a regular's discount."

"Thank you. I'll visit frequently."

With a polite bow, Lee Chang-jin received the bag.

Jin Seon-ah hooked her arm around his, looking like a natural couple, drawing envious glances.

Sensing the stares, Jin Seon-ah whispered,

"We look good together, don't we?"

"Hmm, am I that handsome?"

"Oh my, what are you saying? It's all thanks to me. This beauty doesn't go unnoticed."

Lee Chang-jin chuckled and whispered,

"Alright, Seon-ah, your arms are strong."

"What? What did you say?"

"Haha, I said you're right."

"That's not what you said! You were teasing me, weren't you?"

"It's a misunderstanding. Why would I do that?"

Bickering, they continued walking.

Just then, an appetizing aroma filled the air.

A savory, oily smell.

Following the scent, they stopped in front of a store.

‘Yeongcheon Nutrition Center’ was written in large letters, an old-fashioned chicken place.

Inside a machine with red lights, chickens skewered on metal rods were slowly rotating.

Juicy chickens were dripping with oil.

Lee Chang-jin watched with nostalgic eyes. The sight of chickens sizzling in the heat brought back memories.

Back then, a whole chicken cost 1,500 won, making it a rare treat only affordable on payday.

The transition from grilling chickens wrapped in aluminum foil over stones or fire to using automatic nichrome wire heaters wasn't that long ago.

In front of the chicken shop, people were fascinated by the rotating chickens.

Lost in thought, Lee Chang-jin was nudged by Jin Seon-ah.

"What are you thinking about?"

Startled, Lee Chang-jin quickly made an excuse.

"Nothing, it looks delicious. How about we have chicken?"

"Sure, I actually wanted to try it too."

Entering the chicken shop, they took a seat by the window.

Seated, Lee Chang-jin placed an order.

"Ajumma, one chicken, please!"

Soon, a golden, crispy rotisserie chicken was served.

The chicken, with its crispy skin and moist meat, made Lee Chang-jin crave beer.

"Ajumma, one beer, please."

"Got it!"

Soon, two glasses and a cold beer with a foamy head were served.

The cold beer offered a refreshing bite.

"Ah! Beer and chicken are a perfect match."

Jin Seon-ah smiled sweetly as she swirled her beer glass.

Her innocent expression made Lee Chang-jin feel happy too.

"Ah, this reminds me. These beer glasses, you know? The beer companies make them, and there's a reason why the logo is positioned up."

Curious, Jin Seon-ah leaned in.

"What's the reason?"

"The amount of beer poured changes depending on the logo's position. Adjusting the logo's position affects sales. The logo acts as a reference point for pouring."

Jin Seon-ah closely examined the beer glass, now devoid of foam.

"Wow, I didn't know it had such a meaning. That's clever marketing."

"Well, it's not a scam, so it's just a little trick. How many companies make packaging bigger to sell more? Compared to that, this is nothing."

"Marketing is half a scam, isn't it?"

Agreeing, Lee Chang-jin nodded.

"Exactly. For example, the term 'health supplement.' Doesn't it sound a bit off? It's just a convenient way to consume certain ingredients, in pill or extract form. But the word 'health' makes people buy it, even if it has no relation to disease treatment. They market it as if it's medicine."

Jin Seon-ah nodded.

"The way something is presented makes a big difference. Even with people, the customer's attitude changes dramatically when you're wearing luxury clothes compared to ordinary ones."

The way something is expressed can completely change its perception. Jin Seon-ah's words made Lee Chang-jin think of nitrogen chips, an issue from the past. Suddenly, he remembered what the market lady said earlier.

"He looks decent, but what's important is if he can support a woman."

An idea struck him like lightning.

If packaging is so important, why not change the packaging?

Even for the agreement. Changing the wording might change the perception.

Inspired, Lee Chang-jin stood up mid-bite.

"That's it!"

"What's going on? Why suddenly...?"

Ignoring the puzzled Jin Seon-ah, he hurriedly gathered his things.

"I just got a great idea. I need to go right away."

"Already? Can't you at least finish eating? I can't eat all this by myself!"

Seeing Jin Seon-ah's disappointed face, Lee Chang-jin got up and approached her.

Then, he gave her a light peck on the cheek.

Jin Seon-ah's eyes widened in surprise.

"Hiccup!"

Her cheeks turned red like a rabbit's.

Stunned, she couldn't utter a word, while Lee Chang-jin smiled.

"Thank you, and I'm really sorry for today. Let's have a good time next time."

Leaving the frozen Jin Seon-ah behind, Lee Chang-jin exited the chicken shop.

Jin Seon-ah kept replaying Lee Chang-jin's words in her mind.

She unknowingly muttered to herself.

"Next time what?"

With one cheek burning, Jin Seon-ah sat there for a long time.

Lee Chang-jin's office in Seodaemun-gu,

Seeing Lee Chang-jin return so quickly, Ye Jin-joo was surprised.

"Why are you back so early? Weren't you on a date?"

"I just remembered something urgent. Manager Ye, please bring me a copy of the pallet agreement."

Without even taking off his suit jacket, Lee Chang-jin began working. He was in a hurry, afraid he might forget. Sitting in front of the typewriter, he reviewed the copy.

Lee Chang-jin started with the title of the 『Pallet Joint Usage Agreement』.

"A joint usage agreement... This wording needs to be changed."

He changed the title to 『Pallet Joint Usage Guide』 and reviewed the agreement again.

"If the pallet is not returned immediately without damage after use, if it is delayed, leaked externally, used for other purposes, or damaged, compensation must be made."

This wording might have irked Director Yoo.

Lee Chang-jin thought from a different perspective.

"Yeah. This wording might have felt too coercive and direct."

After some thought, he changed it to:

"In case of pallet loss or damage, additional costs may inevitably occur, so we kindly ask for your active cooperation in pallet recovery."

After several revisions, Lee Chang-jin stayed up all night.

The early morning staff were surprised to see him.

"Boss, did you not go home?"

"Hmm... I was busy. Is it morning already?"

Engrossed in his work, Lee Chang-jin hadn't noticed the time.

To wake up, he showered in the office and then headed to the Daese Group headquarters.

Although Director Yoo had previously refused to meet regarding the agreement, Lee Chang-jin didn't give up.

Forcing his way into the office, he politely presented the revised guide.

"Please reconsider this matter."

Director Yoo looked displeased but took the document.

As he silently read, Lee Chang-jin clenched his fists nervously.

Had his earnestness reached him?

Director Yoo's stern face gradually softened.

It was a noticeable change.

Finally, after reading, Director Yoo slowly stood up.

He gestured for Lee Chang-jin to sit on the reception sofa.

"If you had written it like this from the start, it would have been better. Don't you think?"

After some advice, Director Yoo called his secretary to bring the company seal and ink, stamping the document on the spot.

Thud!

The sound of the seal being stamped felt as heavy as a bowling ball hitting the floor.

Holding the document, Lee Chang-jin chuckled inwardly. He had only changed the title; the content was the same. With the Daese Group's stamp, he had completed all the agreements.

Feeling relieved, Lee Chang-jin called Jin Seon-ah.

"Seon-ah, thank you. Everything worked out well."

"I don't know what it is, but I'm glad. But what did you mean by what you said last time?"

"Who knows? It's up to interpretation."

"Oh, come on. What is that?"

Lee Chang-jin chuckled at her pouty response.

It was an event that reaffirmed the power of words.
