## Episode 39: Clark Company

“What is it, sir?”

“Go to the food section immediately and buy some unprocessed potatoes, grapes, and apples. Oranges would be fine too.”

“What? Why do we need those all of a sudden?”

“The buyers want to see a drying demonstration. We're going to test it out for them. We need it right away, so please bring it as quickly as possible.”

“Ah, understood.”

Not long after the employees left, a tray full of fruits arrived at the booth. The fruits and vegetables, like potatoes and pumpkins, were sliced and neatly arranged on plates.

Lee Chang-jin turned around and spoke.

“Let's start the demonstration. It might take about 5 to 10 minutes, so please bear with us.”

The fruits and vegetables were loaded into the dryer. As the door was closed and the power was turned on, a buzzing sound indicated that the equipment was running.

Since it was hard to gauge the moisture content of the materials, they decided to dry them at high temperature for 10 minutes first, and then adjust the drying time in 5-minute increments for the demonstration.

After 10 minutes passed, Lee Chang-jin ventilated the area and stepped back.

“For your safety, please maintain a safe distance as steam might escape. We ask for your understanding and cooperation.”

Soon, the dried and moisture-removed fruits appeared, drawing gasps of amazement from the spectators. The aroma of the fruits filled the booth, catching the attention of all the visitors.

Lee Chang-jin picked up the cooled fruits and offered a plate to a white man who had asked a question earlier.

“Please try it. You can check if it's properly dried.”

The man cautiously picked up a dried apple and took a careful bite, experiencing a crisp texture like a snack.

“Oh! This is incredible. It really works.”

“The performance is perfect.”

“These potatoes are really crispy. They taste like potato chips.”

“Indeed. You could just sprinkle some seasoning on them.”

The accompanying staff also tasted the dried fruits and vegetables and couldn't hide their amazement.

“This is impressive. Developing a product with such performance... It’s on par with leading international products.”

“You flatter me. Thank you for your kind words.”

“I’m not just saying this. Could we order a smaller size of this? We’d like to supply one to each of our branches. Oh, and can it be painted in different colors?”

“Of course. Both size and color can be adjusted as needed.”

The man handed over a business card after shaking hands.

“Here’s my business card and contact information. I’ll check the requirements with our company’s development department. I’ll contact you later to discuss the order quantity and detailed specifications.”

“Understood. How will the order process work?”

“Ah, the order proceeds after the cost estimate is received. You can negotiate the cost with our contract department.”

“Thank you.”

The company on the business card was surprisingly Picard, a renowned French company in the distribution and frozen food industry. As the positive feedback from the first buyer spread, merchants and spectators from around the world flocked to the booth, making the staff even busier. Riding on the increased popularity, Lee Chang-jin decided to hold another demonstration in the afternoon.

Due to word of mouth, spectators flooded in the following days to see the performance. The crowd gathered in front of the vacuum dryer, bombarding them with questions, making customer service challenging.

Once the floodgates opened, the interest was overwhelming. Not only food companies but also major global companies like Germany’s Miele, Bosch, and Siemens showed interest. Surprised by the enthusiastic response, Manager Eom teased Lee Chang-jin.

“This is a massive hit. You’re going to make a lot of money with this, Mr. Lee.”

“Haha, it’s all thanks to your support, Manager Eom. I couldn’t have done it alone.”

“Just don’t forget this success when things go well.”

“Of course. By the way, the response from Anyang Steel is also quite positive.”

“Haha, right. Our company’s product quality has always been good. It’s just that we weren’t well-known. Everyone needs to stay on their toes.”

Along with the vacuum dryer’s popularity, there was also increased interest in stainless steel and cold-rolled steel plates.

Three days flew by in the blink of an eye.

The event, which was a great success, was now nearing its end.

On the last day, in the afternoon, the crowd thinned out.

As the exhibition approached its closure, preparations for dismantling were in full swing behind the exhibition.

The companies that had achieved significant results were already preparing to return home.

Looking around the noticeably quieter booth, Manager Eom spoke.

“You must be tired. How about you go and rest? You haven’t had proper sleep for almost three days, right? Most of the overseas buyers seem to have left, so we can handle the remaining customer service.”

“Haha, it's fine. Who knows? The main guest often arrives late. I’ll stay a bit longer.”

“Who can stop you? Alright, take care.”

Recently, Lee Chang-jin’s schedule had been brutal. He barely slept 2-3 hours a day, busy with exhibition preparations even before he could adjust to the time difference. He had to run around all day, attending to customer service and buyers.

Despite the exhausting schedule, Lee Chang-jin never showed any signs of fatigue and stayed until the end. He knew from experience that while many companies showed interest, it rarely led to actual deals.

As he massaged his aching legs and continued to watch the booth, he noticed a stranger entering. The man, a white guy, wandered around the booth, inspecting various steel products displayed at the Korean pavilion.

After a while, the man stopped in front of the vacuum dryer, scrutinizing the equipment.

Seeing this, Lee Chang-jin cleared his throat and approached him.

“Hello. Is there anything you need?”

“Ah, actually, can I take a closer look at this product? If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to touch it to see how it’s finished.”

“That’s not a problem. Please, this way.”

The man, approaching the vacuum dryer, carefully inspected the equipment, touching the steel joints and edges with his rough hands. Finally, he asked in an admiring tone.

“The finishing is meticulous. It looks like the steel plates have been heat-treated, and the welding technique is impressive. Which company developed this product?”

“Daese Industries. It's a small to medium-sized enterprise located in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul.”

“Daese Industries, is it an affiliate of Anyang Steel?”

“It’s not an affiliate, but we have a close partnership.”

“So, you’re a related party. Does Daese Industries produce other products besides this one?”

“Yes, of course. We also manufacture and supply gears for automobiles, industrial cranes, and hoists.”

“Cranes?”

The man muttered in surprise.

“Are you saying this company actually manufactures and supplies cranes?”

“Yes, that’s correct. We supply to major companies like Cheongwoo and Ohseong.”

“Hmm... That’s interesting. I’ve never heard of this company, but I’d like to know more. Could you tell me more?”

“Of course.”

Lee Chang-jin answered the man’s questions sincerely, explaining that Daese Industries was a startup only a year old.

“Amazing. Growing so quickly in just a year... The CEO must be quite capable.”

“Haha, thank you. Actually, I’m the CEO of that company.”

The man, surprised by Lee Chang-jin’s honest reply, widened his eyes.

“Oh, really? To come all the way here to promote your company, your passion is remarkable.”

“Haha. A CEO must put in the effort for the company to succeed. I’m just doing what I should be doing.”

“It’s something that’s obvious but hard to put into practice. There’s always a reason for a company’s success.”

“Haha, you’re flattering me. It’s embarrassing to hear.”

After exchanging compliments for a while, the man took out his business card.

“Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Robert. I work for a heavy equipment company and am the Asia-Pacific manager. My parents live here, so I was on vacation for a few days. I wasn’t planning to visit the exhibition, but a friend told me about an interesting invention, so I came to check it out. I didn’t expect to meet the CEO here.”

Lee Chang-jin checked the company name on the business card and was a little surprised.

‘Clark Company?’

Founded in 1917, Clark Company is a world-renowned heavy equipment manufacturer based in the U.S., dominating 40% of the global forklift market and known for producing large construction equipment like payloaders and cranes.

That such a company would be interested in a small company like Daese was surprising. While Lee Chang-jin examined the business card, the man spoke again.

“Our company has recently taken a keen interest in the rapidly growing Asian market. Instead of directly entering the market, we find it more advantageous to collaborate with local companies that have the technology and reliability. If your schedule permits, could we arrange a factory tour? We’d like to visit your company to assess and discuss infrastructure expansion and collaboration in detail.”

“That’s wonderful news. We welcome visitors at any time. Please contact us whenever it’s convenient. We’ll be waiting.”

For Lee Chang-jin, this was an unexpected but significant proposal. Partnering with a globally renowned company like Clark could be a chance for Daese to take a big leap forward. With a positive response, Robert smiled and extended his hand for a handshake.

“Then, I’ll take that as a yes. I’ll see you soon in Seoul.”

After his conversation with Robert, no more buyers visited the booth. As the exhibition came to a close, the remaining participants busily dismantled their booths.

The teardown was swift, completed in just two hours, thanks to the many helpers attending the exhibition.

Clearing his hands with a satisfied look, Lee Chang-jin addressed the people around him.

“Everyone, may I have your attention, please? If you’re not too busy, I’d like to invite all of you to a dinner gathering to thank you for your hard work. Anyang Steel has kindly prepared a simple reception at a nearby Korean restaurant. I’d appreciate it if you could all attend.”

It was a small gesture Lee Chang-jin had arranged in consultation with Anyang Steel. Having observed the helpers throughout the exhibition, Lee Chang-jin felt he couldn’t let them leave empty-handed.

The helpers’ faces brightened noticeably at his words. They all boarded a large bus and headed to the Korean restaurant. An amiable middle-aged lady greeted Lee Chang-jin warmly.

“Welcome, sir.”

“I spoke to you a few days ago. Is everything ready?”

“Of course. Please, come in.”

Inside, the helpers’ eyes widened in surprise. The interior resembled a traditional Korean banquet, leaving everyone in awe. Feeling a bit shy, Manager Eom scratched his head.

“Everyone, please take a seat. I went to great lengths to prepare this. If the food is insufficient, feel free to order more and enjoy.”

The table was laid out with well-grilled pork belly, LA galbi with thick meat, meatballs that seemed to melt in the mouth, bubbling oyster soup and japchae, fish stew, tofu, appetizers, and even a royal hotpot, reminiscent of a feast for foreign dignitaries at a hotel. For students who usually filled their stomachs with bread and milk in student cafeterias, this was a rare luxury.

“Please, enjoy your meal. Feel free to take some home if you need.”

Seeing the students’ happy faces as they enjoyed the food, Lee Chang-jin felt pleased. He couldn’t help but see himself in those students. Born into a poor family without financial support from his parents, Lee Chang-jin had to pay for his education since high school.

Delivering milk in the morning and working part-time jobs like tutoring and translating during college, Lee Chang-jin had experienced a similar struggle, making the students’ situation feel personal to him.

While everyone was eating, a student in a checkered shirt and thick glasses raised his hand and asked.

“Mr. Lee, may I ask a question?”

“Yes, go ahead.”

“I heard you’re from Mannheim, and I’m curious about something. What made you decide to start your own business? Mannheim is a world-renowned company, so why leave a stable position? Was there a specific reason or motivation?”

Everyone at the table paused their meals, intrigued by the question.

All eyes turned to Lee Chang-jin, waiting for his answer.
