## Episode 131: Cosmetics Development

“If a functional product with both whitening and UV protection effects is released, it will be able to dominate the market at once.”

In the 1970s, the quality of domestic cosmetics manufactured in Korea was very poor compared to foreign products, and imports from overseas were not active due to trade barriers.

On the other hand, the titanium dioxide produced by Lee Chang-jin was the main ingredient of sunscreen, and it was a well-refined pure crystal that was difficult to obtain in Korea.

That's why Lee Chang-jin came up with the idea of cosmetics as a way to generate additional revenue.

Gu Chang-dong muttered a little sullenly.

“Even so, if you had given us a heads-up that you were preparing something like this, we could have helped you.”

“Haha, it was a top-secret project, so it was difficult to say anything. Moreover, research and development has been sluggish until recently, so we were waiting for the results to come out.”

In fact, the reason why Lee Chang-jin did not speak was because he was concerned about security, in case there might be an informant within the company. It was better to be careful about security, as industrial spies stealing high-level information from other companies were rampant.

At that moment, a woman in a white coat like a doctor appeared from somewhere, along with the sound of footsteps.

“Ah, you're here, sir?”

“Yes, Director Lee, how is the research going?”

“Of course. It is progressing quite smoothly. More than that, who are these people?”

The group who came together straightened up, their eyes full of interest. Lee Chang-jin spoke.

“Ah, you all must be meeting for the first time. Well, say hello, everyone. This is Deputy Jeong Ho-seong, the head of the trade department, and this is Deputy Gu Chang-dong, a founding member of our company.”

“Ah, hello. I'm Gu Chang-dong.”

“This is Jeong Ho-seong.”

“Yes, hello. I am Lee Do-young, the head of the cosmetics business division.”

Lee Chang-jin briefly introduced her.

“Director Lee graduated from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Hankuk University and holds a master's and doctorate degrees from Sorbonne University. She originally worked for L'Oréal, but Deputy Yoon brought her here after trying three times.”

Lee Do-young was a person with round glasses and noticeably white skin.

As befits a person in the beauty industry, she acted very elegant and sophisticated.

“It's nice to meet you, Deputy Jeong. I heard that you have a knack for dyes and chemicals? Please guide me if there are any shortcomings in the future.”

“Yes, I look forward to working with you.”

Jeong Ho-seong, a little taken aback by the other person's kind reaction, nodded his head again.

Jeong Ho-seong, who had finished greeting each other, looked around as if trying to relieve his awkwardness and said.

“By the way, there are almost no male employees here.”

Come to think of it, most of the employees he saw on his way here were women.

At his words, Lee Do-young said as if she was proud.

“Yes. Most of them are female intellectuals who have had their careers interrupted due to pregnancy, marriage, etc., except for management. Thanks to the president, they are able to work again, and I don't know how grateful they are.”

In the 1970s, being a ‘working mom’ was nearly impossible.

Most women whose careers were interrupted had difficulty getting re-employed, no matter how good a school or job they had. But isn't the main customer base for cosmetics women?

So, Lee Chang-jin hired experienced employees who had experience working for cosmetics companies as much as possible.

As it was an opportunity that was not easily available at the moment, the re-employed employees worked harder than anyone else.

Gu Chang-dong, who heard the story, soon nodded his head with a respectful look, as if he understood.

“As expected, sir, you were carrying out this social work behind the scenes… I'm touched.”

Lee Chang-jin changed the subject with an embarrassed look.

“Don't say it's social work, don't be ridiculous. More than that, has the pH problem that we had last time been resolved?”

“Yes. When I added a small amount of sodium hydroxide, the fusion went better than expected. It seems that the oil content and emulsifier ingredients were the problem.”

“That's a relief. Can I see the sample?”

“Of course.”

The place where Lee Do-young took the group was none other than the product research lab. As the temperature of the contents on the hot plate rose, it was shown that they were put into a stirrer and mixed while slowly increasing the rotation speed.

It was a process of slowly lowering the temperature of the well-dispersed materials and stirring them with a motorized stirrer so that they were well mixed. When the emulsified product was cooled down in a tub filled with ice water, the cream was completed in an instant.

Lee Do-young, who put the cream in a small sample container, handed it to Lee Chang-jin.

“Here, try applying it.”

Lee Chang-jin, who received the cosmetics, spread the cream thinly on the back of his hand. Jeong Ho-seong and Gu Chang-dong, who were watching what Lee Chang-jin was doing, followed suit.

Lee Do-young, who was watching their appearance intently, asked in a slightly nervous tone.

“How do you feel?

“Well, it's sticky and adheres to the skin, but it's more viscous than last time.”

“Yes. This one got better reviews than the last time. I thought it would be better to have a little viscosity than to be too watery, so I improved it.”

“Good work. Are there any problems with skin absorption?”

“After using it, it was well absorbed without white cast, and most of the reviews said that the makeup was easily removed.”

Putting it on my skin, it was clear that it was a product that was definitely effective in adjusting skin tone.

Unconsciously, I put my nose to it, and a cool scent wafted through the air. The scent of light rose mixed with citrus added to the luxury.

“Hmm, if it's like this, it's in the completion stage, but how were the evaluation results?”

“I'll have to get it confirmed, but in terms of self-inspection, both safety and functionality have been rated A. The UV protection index came out to be PA++ grade.”

“With this level, we can definitely get the functional certification mark.”

“Yes, there seems to be no problem with the functional part now. I'll have to do a clinical trial to be sure, but it seems to be almost finished.”

“Good work. Then the point is to secure the raw materials needed for production.”

“Yes, that's right.”

Lee Chang-jin looked back at the two people who came with him and said.

“Did you hear that? Deputy Jeong Ho-seong, please receive the raw material list and find out the supplier. If the supply of raw materials is cut off when we enter the production stage, it will be a big deal. Also, Deputy Gu, please mobilize the cosmetics salespeople for the time being to hand out samples to beauty salons or markets and check consumer reactions first. Let's look at the market reaction first, and see if there's anything else we need to improve on.”

“Leave it to me, sir.”

“Yes, I understand. Your order is my command!”

The two, who had received their instructions, immediately set to work.

A little later, news came from Jeong Ho-seong, who was in charge of trade, that most of the import routes had been secured.

“Jojoba oil and other imported items have secured all of our customers. The only thing left is the fragrance, and PEA (Phenethyl Alcohol) is the problem.”

“What's wrong with PEA?”

PEA is a raw material for fragrances that smells like roses, and it is often used as a fragrance for cosmetics instead of rose oil.

To his words, Jeong Ho-seong replied.

“In the case of PEA, there is no domestic production yet. So, most of the imported fragrance volume is sold exclusively through agents belonging to trading companies. The problem is that the company that monopolizes the import source of high-quality fragrances among these trading companies is Osung Trading.”

Oseong Trading is an affiliate of the Oseong Group. Since Taeyang and Oseong were related by marriage, they maintained a very close relationship.

The possibility of acting as an import agent for competitor Lee Chang-jin was extremely slim.

“That's a big deal. Can't we replace it with another fragrance?”

“Linalool is also quite popular as a substitute, but it has to be imported from the European Jibo Party… I'm afraid it will be difficult because the unit price is too high due to logistics costs.”

“Then what would be good?”

“We are considering direct import rather than going through a trading company. For now, I placed an order with Takasago in Japan, but I haven't received any response yet.”

“Hmm, I guess they think of our company as a neighborhood grocery store.”

Lee Chang-jin's expression became serious.

The most decisive factor when ordinary people buy cosmetics is the scent of the cosmetics. When testing cosmetics for the first time, people unconsciously apply the product to the back of their hand and then bring it to the tip of their nose to check the scent.

As such, no matter how excellent the ingredients of cosmetics are, if they do not satisfy the senses conveyed to the brain through smell, that is, the scent, it is difficult to satisfy consumers' desire to purchase.

Lee Chang-jin, who was well aware of this situation, could not just wait for the supplier's decision.

In the end, Lee Chang-jin made up his mind.

“Then there's no other way. I have to go myself. For now, the cosmetics are in the final stages, so please apply for functional cosmetics review with the Ministry of Health and Welfare.”

“Yes? What are you going to do?”

“If it's difficult to get raw materials from them, I have no choice but to meet them in person and persuade them. If the president goes directly, wouldn't they see it differently?”

“But wouldn't it be better to leave it to Deputy Jeong than to do it yourself? Your wedding is just around the corner.”

“No. What's more important than this right now? If the president goes directly, they will understand our sincerity.”

There was no answer but to run directly to make things happen.

That afternoon, when Lee Chang-jin invited Jin Seon-ah to his house and asked for her understanding of his business trip to Japan, Jin Seon-ah made a sullen face.

“You're going on another business trip even though the engagement is right around the corner?”

“This is absolutely necessary for the new product we are developing.”

Jin Seon-ah, who was listening to the explanation, folded her arms and glared at Lee Chang-jin.

“Hmm. Look, Mr. President. I understand the urgency, but isn't this a bit too much? It's almost the first time we've seen each other in ten thousand years. The first thing you say to your fiancée before getting married is that you're going on a business trip? So you're saying I should prepare for the engagement alone?”

Her cheeks were flushed with a faint blush. Lee Chang-jin, who had nothing to say, just bowed his head.

Lee Chang-jin, who felt sorry, hurriedly soothed her.

“I'm sorry, ma'am. I was in a hurry. I should have discussed it with you in advance, I've committed a terrible sin.”

At Lee Chang-jin's surrendering attitude, Jin Seon-ah looked at him with sullen eyes.

After a moment of silence, she replied with a softer expression.

“Well, that's okay. It's not like I met him without knowing he was that kind of person. However, I'm not going to let this one slide. You'll have to pay me back later with interest.”

“Yes, ma'am. So, do you allow me?”

“Well, are you the type of person who wouldn't go if I didn't allow it? Anyway, I have work to do in Japan too, so it's a good thing. I was going to go a little later, but let's go together this time.”

“Ah, Ms. Seon-ah too?”

“Yes. I'm going to get some advice on setting up a merchant bank. I need to talk to the experts there and see how they operate and how they do business, right?”

“That's a very good idea.”

The two, who had suddenly turned into business mode, continued their discussion on the laws and cases related to the establishment of merchant banks for a while.

Jin Seon-ah, who was talking passionately, smiled awkwardly as if she had realized something.

“Oh my, again. I can't think of anything but business when I see Changjin. It's not even a conditioned reflex, I can't help it.”

“What's good is good. So you don't like it?”

“No. I like it.”

Perhaps because she had a glass of wine, her eyes were twinkling more brightly than usual.

Jin Seon-ah, acting cute, sat on Lee Chang-jin's lap and gently wrapped her arms around his neck. A soft perfume scent emanated from behind her ear as she brushed her hair back.

When Lee Chang-jin kissed her, Jin Seon-ah responded passionately. Lee Chang-jin unconsciously groped her. After a while, the living room light went out.
