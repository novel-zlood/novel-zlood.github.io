## Episode 25: Chuseok Gifts

"One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand... how many zeros is that?"

At those words, Uncle Dongsik, who was beside him, peeked over and gaped.

"Let's see, one, two... six zeros, no, that's two million won. Oh my, such a large sum."

The amount in the bankbook was a whopping 2 million won. Considering that a piece of farmland in Iksan costs about 20,000 won, it was enough to buy over 100 pieces. For people in the countryside, it was an eye-popping amount.

"I don't have any reason to use such a large amount of money. This is enough."

The father, who received the bankbook, firmly refused.

Feeling unworthy as a father who had done nothing to deserve it, he was reluctant to accept such a gift.

"What have I done to receive such a large amount?"

At that, Uncle Dongsik said,

"Hyung-nim, just keep it. It's a token of sincerity, you should accept it."

"Yes, it's fine, so please accept it without any burden. My hands are ashamed."

Lee Chang-jin forcibly handed the bankbook to his father, who kept refusing. His stiff hands, like pine bark, felt very warm. Unable to resist his son's repeated requests, the father reluctantly accepted the money.

"Alright, I'll use this money wisely when it's really needed."

Though he said so, his father never knew how to spend money.

He had never bought a new set of clothes or item.

Lee Chang-jin felt sorry for his father.

"I'll send you some pocket money separately, so please buy yourself some clothes and whatever you need. Father, if someone sees your worn-out work clothes, they'll think badly of me. And get new clothes for Mother and Changsik too."

"My goodness. People will think we're starving or something, alright. Alright, I'll take your advice."

While the people who had been making a fuss were setting the table, workers installing the TV set in the hall asked Lee Chang-jin,

"Sir, where should we put the antenna? To get a proper signal, it needs to be high up..."

"Then, there's a pole behind the flagpole, it would be good to attach it there."

Thirty minutes later, Lee Chang-jin gave the workers their wages as they finished up.

"Here is the transportation fee and today's wages."

The workers, checking the amount, tilted their heads in confusion. It was 5,000 won more than the agreed amount.

"Sir, this is more than what we agreed upon."

"Oh, it's Chuseok, so I added a bit more to your wages. Consider it pocket money for your families."

"This much? Thank you very much. Please call us again in the future."

Then, his mother came out and handed over a bundle.

"Here, I packed some songpyeon and jeon, please take it and enjoy."

"Oh... thank you very much."

After the workers left, the meal at the village hall began.

As people gathered around and sat down, they all gathered in front of the TV.

"Shall we see if the TV works well?"

As they turned on the TV, everyone exclaimed in delight.

The daily drama "Suguk" was being aired, which was a popular war drama featuring top talent Na Yoo-chun, appealing to a wide audience regardless of age.

"That damn commie... should kill him right away..."

"That dumbass... doesn't even realize there's a spy next to him..."

The men of the village, overly immersed in the drama, started making comments.

With the smell of grilled ribs and jeon filling the air, the atmosphere felt warm.

The bustling chatter and the faint smell of songpyeon steaming outside added to the cozy scene, making Lee Chang-jin smile without realizing it.

Why did he not realize in his past life that every little thing was true happiness?

Just then, his cousin, who was peeling chestnuts beside him, suddenly asked,

"So, when are you getting married, Hyung? You're so handsome and tall, but there's no news."

"Well, I'm busy with work right now. But I'll start preparing soon."

Although the age of first marriages was being delayed due to urbanization, Lee Chang-jin was already 28. It was time to start thinking about it.

Lee Chang-jin thought it was a bit premature to start dating just as his business was settling down.

But someone took his words differently.

"Shall I introduce someone to you? There are many good ladies around here."

"Hey, what are you saying? A man busy with business doesn't have time for that. Leave him be. He'll handle it himself."

Before his aunt could continue her subtle matchmaking, his father snapped at her.

But his aunt, shameless, muttered slyly,

"I'm just worried about Chang-jin's marriage... wouldn't it be a bit late if he waits too long..."

"What, a successful businessman like him can't get married? He'll find his match, so don't just match him with anyone."

"Alright... Oppa. You're such a doting father. Acting so high and mighty."

Though his aunt shrank back, his mother seemed subtly interested.

As she quietly peeled an apple, she cautiously asked,

"But really, is there no one around you?"

All eyes from his cousins and relatives focused on Lee Chang-jin.

Feeling a bit uncomfortable with their eager gazes, Lee Chang-jin thought of Jin Seon-ah, who had visited him before.

'Is this what they call a budding relationship?'

Since looking for a factory site, Jin Seon-ah and Lee Chang-jin had gotten quite close.

Though it was hard to be certain, Jin Seon-ah's attitude towards him suggested she had at least some interest. Otherwise, why would she gift him a luxury car?

Lee Chang-jin also didn't deny the attraction he felt towards her.

But if he answered honestly, it would surely lead to a bothersome situation.

So, Lee Chang-jin decided to be vague.

"Don't worry, Mother, I have someone in mind."

"Really? Who is she?"

"She's a good woman. A really great woman."

At that, his mother's face noticeably brightened.

Knowing her son's personality, she understood that was high praise.

"Of course, right? Our son can handle everything on his own."

"Obviously. Our son is capable. What woman wouldn't fall for him?"

His mother's urging question made his father excitedly ask,

"So, when can we meet her?"

"Haha, I'm still considering it, but I'll bring her when the time is right."

"Alright. Just make sure not to rush and have kids in a hurry... it's better to have kids after marriage."

His father's rebuttal sounded incredulous,

"What are you talking about? You should seize her before a competitor shows up. If you have to, just go for it."

"What? What are you teaching him?"

"Am I wrong? A man shouldn't hesitate. Charge forward. Don't worry about what others think. Next time, you can bring the grandkids too."

"You really have no filter. Don't listen to your father, it'll get you in trouble."

"Don't worry. That won't happen."

Lee Chang-jin felt a cold sweat from his father's words.

With any ordinary girl, it might have been different. But she was Jin Tae-chun's daughter. Lee Chang-jin subtly changed the subject.

"Is there anything inconvenient here, Father? It must be hard to farm now... why don't you rest and live with me in Seoul? I'll take care of you."

"What would an uneducated farmer like me do in Seoul? I'm comfortable here, farming until I die. It's my calling."

"But isn't it too hard?"

"It's what I've done my whole life, it's not hard. I'm fine. If I don't have something to do, my body will rust."

Though his father waved off his concerns, his mother spoke differently.

As if she had been waiting for this, she said,

"It's not okay. He's already suffering. Your father often goes to the pharmacy because of his bad back. It would be great if you could get him some tonic."

"Hey, I'm fine, stop talking nonsense. I'm fine, really. Don't say unnecessary things."

Though his father spoke nonchalantly, Lee Chang-jin was worried.

Earlier, he had noticed his father moving his back with some discomfort.

Blaming himself for his indifference, Lee Chang-jin took the opportunity while his father was away to ask Uncle Dongsik, who was drinking nearby.

"Uncle, is my father really unwell?"

Uncle Dongsik, a bit drunk, answered,

"Well, for his age, he's pretty healthy. But his old back injury is the problem. If he could rest a bit, he'd be fine, but he keeps working."

"Can't you make him rest? Iâ€™ll ask you a favor."

"Hah, easier said than done. He's been working like an ox his whole life. He doesn't know how to rest. I've told him to stop so many times. But old folks are stubborn. If we had decent farming equipment here, it would help."

Though it sounded like he had an agenda, Lee Chang-jin didn't dismiss it.

Trying to find something to help his parents, an idea suddenly came to him.

"Then, should I get him a tractor?"

The government had been heavily supporting the relatively neglected agricultural sector to ensure food self-sufficiency. With substantial subsidies, it was possible to buy farming machinery at a low cost. However, Uncle Dongsik was not enthusiastic.

"Ha, in this rural area with no proper roads, what good is machinery? It would just get stuck in the mud when it rains and be a hassle if it breaks down. Don't bother."

"Then we should pave the roads properly, shouldn't we? You should have contacted the county office or the Saemaul Headquarters."

At his words, the village head sighed in frustration.

"Don't you think we've thought of that? But they always say there's no budget. Our village is small, so we're low priority. We've petitioned the county office several times, but there's been no response."

Lee Chang-jin felt a pang of sorrow. His father, still working hard at farming in his old age. Yet, being a workaholic himself, he could understand his father.

'Maybe I should pave the roads myself?'

Though paving the roads would be costly, it wasn't impossible. After all, he wasn't doing this to make money. As Lee Chang-jin was contemplating, Uncle Dongsik spoke hesitantly.

"Actually, Chang-jin... I have an embarrassing request. Could you perhaps find a job in Seoul?"

"A job? What kind of job?"

"It's embarrassing to say... but I'm worried about Dong-geun. You remember Dong-geun, don't you? My second son."

"Yes, I remember. What's up with Dong-geun?"

"Dong-geun graduated from agricultural high school but quit his job at a food company after three months. The kid lacks determination..."

"What? Then, what is Dong-geun doing now?"

"What else? He's unemployed. I told him to at least go for a factory interview, but he's just raising chickens at home. It drives me crazy. Our electricity bill is 200 won a month. I'm at my wit's end. I don't know what he's thinking."

"Dong-geun? He didn't seem like that kind of kid... is he preparing for something?"

Lee Chang-jin remembered Dong-geun as quite diligent.

Even as a child, he was so pleasant and hard-working, earning his own pocket money.

He couldn't believe Dong-geun was idling for no reason.

But Uncle Dongsik seemed to think otherwise.

"I don't know. If possible, could you arrange a job through your connections? You have the ability and connections with good companies. It's painful to see a grown man not earning money. If not, maybe you could hire him at your company as a laborer or a guard."

It was a difficult request for Lee Chang-jin. As someone in the machinery business, what could he do with someone from an agricultural background? But he couldn't easily refuse the request of his uncle, who had helped raise him.

Thinking he might need to ask around among his friends and acquaintances, Lee Chang-jin nodded.

"Alright. What's most important is what he wants to do, so I'll meet with him first."

"Thank you. He's probably with the chicks again."

As Lee Chang-jin was about to leave, his mother stopped him.

"Where are you going? You've just arrived. Rest and see him tomorrow."

"No, Mother, I'll go for a walk to digest and exercise a bit."

True to the saying "strike while the iron is hot," Lee Chang-jin, having finished his meal, headed straight to Dong-geun's place.

Lee Chang-jin's destination was the chicken coop where Dong-geun had been spending most of his time.

Under the peeling blue slate roof, in a barn that had sunk about a foot.

Peeking through the tilted door, he saw a short-haired, burly lad squatting down, inspecting something.
