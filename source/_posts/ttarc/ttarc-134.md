## Episode 134: CF Commercial

Three days later, at Yang Kuk-jin's studio.

“Alright, everyone, get ready. Let's make a masterpiece. This is the most important shoot of the month. Is everyone ready?”

“Yes!”

“I like your energy! Let’s have Korean beef if this goes well.”

Yang Kuk-jin, having secured a big project after a long time, was brimming with enthusiasm.

He personally set up all the advertising equipment, including the reflectors, and sketched out the advertisement like a picture.

The concept of this advertisement was 'Elegance'.

He stayed up for three nights in a row for today's shoot.  The commercial he was in charge of this time was no ordinary commercial. The production cost was twice that of the existing advertisement, and there was a special condition attached to it.

The special condition was a promise to guarantee a long-term contract for more than 5 years as the exclusive advertising agency for Daese Chemical if the advertisement became a big hit.

It was a huge opportunity for Yang Kuk-jin, who was a talented but still a rookie.

If he became in charge of advertising for a solid mid-sized company like Daese, he would be able to escape from the level of worrying about rent like now and establish himself as a respectable mid-level player in the industry.

It was only natural that Yang Kuk-jin was more excited than usual.

However, contrary to the expectations of the staff, the CF shoot ran into difficulties from the start.

No matter how long they waited, the promised advertising model did not come.

Yang Kuk-jin, who had checked the storyboard several times, checked his wristwatch with an anxious expression.

As the filming was delayed for half a day, Yang Kuk-jin's patience finally exploded.

“What, is she a snail? Why is she so late! Did you call the manager?”

“Yes. He said they will be here soon……”

“What time do you think it is! Call him again!”

As the director's voice grew louder, the atmosphere of the filming team darkened.

At that moment, the advertising model's manager arrived.

“Why are you so late? What about Suk-hui?”

“I apologize. Suk-hui, something came up on her face, she can’t make it.”

Yang Kuk-jin's face hardened at the news that was completely different from what he had expected.

Yang Kuk-jin, who didn't usually get angry, was too much this time.

Of course, his voice wouldn't come out nice when his nerves were on edge.

“Wow, are you kidding me? Did she get herself a sponsor and now she thinks she’s a top star? Get her over here right now?”

At the angry Yang Kuk-jin's shout, the filming staff didn't know what to do.

Seeing Yang Kuk-jin, a man of gentle personality, raising his voice, they could tell that he was not just angry.

But the clueless manager was still busy making excuses.

“That’s a bit harsh, don’t you think? It’s an unavoidable circumstance, isn’t it? Her face is her life.”

“Hey, Ha Seok-kyu. What do you mean harsh? Put yourself in my shoes. This is business, business! This is a breach of contract! Don't you know how important this shoot is? This isn’t the first time she’s doing this, you think I am a pushover?”

In fact, there was another reason why Yang Kuk-jin was obsessed with this CF shoot besides money.

In the case of advertising photos, it was the principle to take 200 to 300 photos per work for one cut, but until then, the cost of film was so expensive that the number of shots had to be inevitably reduced.

The original Yang Kuk-jin was famous for taking more pictures than any other photographer, so he wasn't making much of a profit. In such a situation, it was unusual for an advertiser to respond by doubling or tripling the production price as in this case.

As this was a golden opportunity to maximize his capabilities and skills, it was understandable that Director Yang was on edge.

However, the manager, unaware of the circumstances, acted brazenly.

“No, that’s too much. It's not like she's not going to shoot the commercial. Can't you wait a day or two until her skin gets better?”

“What? You little!”

While the two were bickering, there was a commotion outside.

“What’s with all the commotion?”

When Lee Chang-jin and his party appeared, the two men who were raising their voices froze in an instant.

Behind them were Director Gu Chang-dong, holding a bottle of drink, and his secretary, Yeo Jin-joo.

Lee Chang-jin, sensing the strange atmosphere, asked Director Yang.

“I came here thinking they were in the middle of filming, but suddenly there was shouting……. What's going on?”

Director Yang, his face flushed, stammered.

“Oh, that…… the model who was supposed to be here hasn't arrived yet, so we haven't started filming yet.”

“Yes? The model isn’t here? Wasn't the shoot supposed to start at 11 a.m.?”

“Th, that…….”

“What’s the reason? Tell me slowly.”

As Gu Chang-dong's expression hardened, Yang Kuk-jin stuttered without realizing it.

Lee Chang-jin asked again calmly.

“What’s the reason she isn’t here?”

Director Yang glanced at the manager, who was shutting his mouth, and replied.

“Skin problems. The model said she couldn't shoot because she had a breakout on her face……”

“Hmm, is that so?”

Noticing Lee Chang-jin’s mood, Yeo Jin-joo whispered.

“That’s a lie. That model, Suk-hui, is famous in the industry for getting sponsored. Not to mention being late, she ditched other shoots before too.”

Lee Chang-jin frowned. Even if there was a real problem with her skin, it was the model's responsibility for not taking care of herself. Moreover, missing such an important shoot without notice was unprecedented.

Lee Chang-jin hated those kinds of people physiologically.

After a moment of contemplation, Lee Chang-jin nodded as if he had made up his mind.

“It can’t be helped. Director Yang, cancel the advertising contract with that model and find a replacement.”

“Huh? So suddenly……”

“Isn't punctuality a basic requirement in the contract? Manager Yeo, is it stated in the CF contract?”

Yeo Jin-joo looked over the documents and pushed up her glasses.

“Yes, it is stated in Article 24.”

“Good. It will be difficult to let this go. Please claim the penalty immediately, and if necessary, file a lawsuit for damages.”

“Yes, sir.”

The manager's face turned pale at his words.

He hadn't even thought that they would make such a decision.

Realizing that his opponent was a formidable one, the manager quickly changed into a meek attitude and made excuses.

“S-Sir. Please give her another chance. Suk-hui, she’s still young and doesn't know any better.”

Lee Chang-jin replied in a tone that said no way.

“If she’s a professional, she should take responsibility for herself. Missing a shoot without any notice on the day of filming is rude no matter how you look at it. We could’ve worked something out if she told us beforehand, who does she think she is fooling?”

“She’s still immature……. She made her debut right after high school, so she doesn't have much experience in social life.”

“If she graduated from high school, she is an adult. Do you think being young is an excuse?”

“W-Well, that's true, but……. If you give us a little more time……”

Lee Chang-jin cut him off as if he had heard enough.

“I'm sorry, but the contract is terminated. Director Yang, make some calls.”

“S-Sir! That’s!”

Gu Chang-dong blocked the manager who was rushing at them with his strong hand.

The employees of Daese Industries, who had come with them, also grabbed his arms.

They were the physical education majors who had recently been hired as bodyguards.

The manager, being dragged away, desperately screamed.

“Sir! Sir!!!”

Yang Kuk-jin smirked at the sight of the manager being dragged away like a dog.

The other studio workers also looked pleased.

It wasn't the first or second time they wanted to mess with the manager for his unsightly behavior.

But that was short-lived, and soon another problem arose.

The models they called were all unavailable as if they had promised.

As they continued to fail, Yang Kuk-jin became embarrassed.

“What day is it? There are no substitutes available, this is bad.”

“There is no model to participate in the shoot?”

“Well, there are people. It's the mask that’s the problem. The model in the cosmetics advertisement must have a pure face. More than anything else, the skin tone should be white and free of blemishes so that even close-up shots look good, but it is a little difficult to find a model that fits the shooting concept.”

Since the date the advertisement was scheduled to be published had already been set, it would be troublesome if they missed today's shoot.

As the hands turning the receiver became busy, someone appeared at the studio.

“Oh, Chang-jin?”

Jin Seon-ah was dressed in a neat suit with sunglasses on. Jin Seon-ah, who found Lee Chang-jin, brushed off the lint on his shoulder and spoke.

“What’s going on? You look upset.”

At Jin Seon-ah's sharp remark, Lee Chang-jin smiled as if it was nothing.

“It’s nothing. The CF model is a little late. How did you know to come here?”

“What do you mean how, I contacted Jin-joo and came to watch. I am also an investor, shouldn't I know how the product advertisement filming is going?”

“You came at the right time. What’s with all that behind you? You brought a lot of stuff.”

Several secretaries with shopping bags lined up behind Jin Seon-ah.

Jin Seon-ah said nonchalantly.

“Oh, I brought some snacks for the staff. I thought you might be hungry. More importantly, what do you mean there’s no model at this hour? Shouldn’t the shoot be almost over by now?”

As Lee Chang-jin and Jin Seon-ah were having an affectionate conversation, Jin Seon-ah and the cinematographer's eyes met by chance.

The cinematographer's face brightened in an instant, and he had an expression as if he had met his savior.

“Oh, hallelujah! The perfect model was right here! I don't know who you are, but have you ever thought about debuting as a model?”

“Excuse me? Me, as a model?”

Jin Seon-ah, bewildered by the unexpected offer, was speechless for a moment. Lee Chang-jin, who was listening to her, stepped in to smooth things over.

“Hold on, Director Yang. This is the woman who will be my wife. And she is not a celebrity.”

“It doesn't matter if she's not a professional model. It's okay because we're just taking pictures and we can pick them out later. Besides, sir, there's no other way right now. All the usable models are booked, so there's no one suitable to shoot. If we don't shoot today, it will be difficult to meet the advertising broadcast schedule.”

Despite Lee Chang-jin's opposition, Director Yang, perhaps because he had met a mask he liked after a long time, did not back down easily.

But in fact, Lee Chang-jin wasn't very keen on having Jin Seon-ah's face on screen.

No matter how much of a businessman he was, there was such a thing as privacy, and he didn't want to see the person he was going to marry being judged by the world like a product on display.

Jin Seon-ah, who was looking at the two alternately, soon shrugged her shoulders as if it was nothing.

“Hmm, I guess it can’t be helped. You said I only have to take pictures of my face without any other exposure, right?

“Of course. It won't take that long. Three hours, no, two hours will be enough.”

“Okay. What's so difficult about that? I just have to follow your lead, right?”

Lee Chang-jin asked worriedly.

“Seon-ah, are you sure you're okay with this?”

“I'm an investor too. It’s no big deal to show my face in a commercial. Besides, I'm actually a little curious about what it's like to shoot a CF.”

Jin Seon-ah’s face, waving her hand as if not to worry, was flushed, as if proving that she was a little excited.

Lee Chang-jin, who had no reason to stop her anymore, sighed.

“Alright. Then Director Yang, please do a good job. Now that you’re doing it, make it look good.”

“Leave it to me. I'll do my best.”

As soon as Lee Chang-jin's permission was granted, Director Yang, whose complexion brightened rapidly, nodded his head twice.

“Let’s hurry. Let’s do the makeup first.”

Makeup artists removed her existing makeup with toner-soaked cotton pads and then prepped her skin.

They applied a generous amount of moisturizer and then a pearlescent makeup base.

When the makeup was finished, Jin Seon-ah opened her eyes and looked at her face in the mirror with satisfaction.

“Oh my, it's pretty. I should definitely learn this makeup style.”

Perhaps thanks to the expert's touch, her face after finishing her makeup looked lively and natural.

When all the preparations were completed, the staff returned to their respective positions and moved in unison at the director's instructions.

Soon, after adjusting the lighting, filming began.
