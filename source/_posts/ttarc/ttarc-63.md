## Episode 63: Fashion Show

Not long after Kim Tae-bang fled by boat, a call came from the police station.

“No, you mean Chairman Kim Tae-bang’s whereabouts are unknown?”

“Yes, we believe he fled abroad with only liquid assets. We’ve secured communication records with a broker and requested a red notice from Interpol.”

“So, it’s confirmed that he fled by boat. Can he be caught?”

“Don’t worry. It seems he fled to Hong Kong or Southeast Asia. Investigative agencies are diligently searching, so he will be caught soon.”

“Thank you for your efforts.”

A while later, new information was relayed to Lee Chang-jin through the police station.

“Mr. Lee, they caught the broker who contacted Kim Tae-bang. The situation has turned quite amusing.”

“What do you mean amusing?”

“It seems the broker took the money and sold Kim Tae-bang to a deep-sea fishing vessel. We have identified the shipowner and their contacts. The ship will return to Vladivostok in three months, with a layover in Montreal, Canada. We will need to ambush and capture him there. Oh, and we’ve recovered all the funds used for his escape, so you don’t need to worry.”

“Kim Tae-bang will have a hard time. Thank you.”

Hwang Cheol-gwan, upon hearing the news, clicked his tongue.

“What a fool. He should have just served his time. So stubborn.”

“Indeed. By the way, what will you do now, Factory Manager? It turns out you’ve amassed quite a fortune. I can’t ask you to work any longer.”

After Kim Tae-bang fled, the accountant disclosed the financial records. The wealth accumulated from the Italian towels amounted to over 10 billion won. By today’s standards, this would be equivalent to hundreds of billions of won in value after the 2000s. Hwang Cheol-gwan, now a sudden millionaire, laughed heartily.

“What are you saying? If I stop working just because I made money, what fun would life be? Don’t even think about firing me now. If you do, I’ll report you to the Ministry of Labor.”

“Haha. I wouldn’t dream of it.”

Hwang Cheol-gwan, smiling, grasped Lee Chang-jin’s hand.

“More than that, Mr. Lee. I’m grateful. It’s all thanks to you. I intend to give you about 20% of the recovered amount as a gift. I’ve asked Lawyer Seo Tae-soo to notarize it.”

“No, you don’t need to do that. It was your money to begin with. I can’t accept such a large sum without any compensation.”

“Don’t refuse, Mr. Lee. This is all for my own peace of mind. Without you, I wouldn’t have recovered this wealth. What distinguishes humans from beasts? You’ve resolved my lifelong regret; it’s my heart’s desire, so please accept it.”

Despite Lee Chang-jin’s repeated refusals, Hwang Cheol-gwan remained adamant. Eventually, unable to overcome his persistence, Lee Chang-jin nodded.

“Thank you. I don’t know how to express my gratitude.”

“It’s a bribe to ask for your continued favor. Take care of me, Mr. Lee.”

Taebang Textiles, banned from selling its products, eventually went bankrupt and entered liquidation. The firm couldn’t manage the debts accumulated from unpaid subcontractor fees. Daese Textile, which succeeded Taebang’s position, purchased all of Taebang’s assets and land at a bargain price.

“The sale price is only one-tenth of the market value. It’s a steal. I was worried about the dryer factory site, but this resolves it cleanly. We’ll renovate the Taebang Textiles factory in Seongsu-dong for dryer production and convert the newly acquired site in Bupyeong into a crane factory.”

“That’s fortunate.”

Meanwhile, the poultry business of the farming association, though neglected, was also thriving. In a few months, the number of broiler chickens increased to over 5,000, and the number of laying hens to over 3,000. They were negotiating with clients for sales, so profits were expected soon.

“Sir, you have a call.”

“Mr. Lee Chang-jin, the board meeting is scheduled. Please come quickly.”

As he headed to Myeong-dong, Jin Seon-ah, dressed in a black long coat, was waiting.

“What’s the matter? There seems to be an increase in board meetings lately.”

“That’s not true. The last meeting was invalid since you fled during it. Here, take this.”

Jin Seon-ah handed over a simple card. The white card with gold trim looked extraordinary. Upon opening it, it only read ‘1975 Winter Collection.’

“What is this?”

“It’s a VIP invitation. This weekend, Mr. Kim Bong-soo is holding a fashion show at the Myeong-dong Terra Department Store. I want you to come with me.”

“What? Me too?”

“Yes. Let’s go together for a change of pace. Mr. Kim Bong-soo wants to meet you. He’ll be thrilled if you come.”

Having recently resolved the patent lawsuit for the Italian towels, Lee Chang-jin became interested in new fields. Though initially producing only bathroom items like Italian towels, he was contemplating expanding into high-end brands. Moreover, having entered the textile industry, he felt the need to develop an eye and sense for fashion.

“A fashion show... It sounds fun. What’s the theme?”

“Snow. He said, ‘How romantic would it be for a couple to have a wedding in white clothes during a snowy winter?’”

“Haha, that’s so Mr. Kim.”

“So, can you make time to attend?”

“It would be an honor. Is there a dress code?”

“Just come as you usually do. A suit is enough.”

Though she said that, her expression showed she was expecting something more. Feeling the unspoken pressure, Lee Chang-jin visited a salon early on the day of the appointment. Wearing a Burberry coat and with his hair slicked back, he arrived at the meeting place, where Jin Seon-ah, dressed in a white fur coat with an elegant updo, was waiting. Her white pearl earrings and necklace added a touch of nobility.

“Very elegant.”

“Going to a fashion show requires at least some etiquette. Shall we go, Mr. Lee?”

“At your service, madam.”

Lee Chang-jin got into the car and headed to the Terra Department Store in Myeong-dong. The front of the remodeled and soon-to-reopen department store was already crowded with early arrivals. A red carpet and photo wall were being set up outside the venue for VIP guests. An employee distributing catalogs approached Jin Seon-ah.

“May I see your invitation, please?”

“Here it is.”

After verifying the card, the employee bowed politely.

“You’re a VIP. This way, please.”

Following the guide into the crystal ballroom, they saw preparations for the runway in full swing. Clothes on hangers were being moved busily under the shifting lights. The runway was Y-shaped, and the seating indicated a significant size.

Thanks to Kim Bong-soo’s reputation, foreign guests were also present at the fashion show. Lee Chang-jin’s seat, the best in the house, came with a table, drinks, cookies, and snacks. Monitors were set up on both sides of the stage for live broadcasts.

On the runway, each model was accompanied by a helper for the rehearsal. Since each model had to change into about ten outfits, they had to check their movements more than ten times each. Watching the tall, slender models power walk naturally drew the eye.

Jin Seon-ah chuckled lightly.

“Hm, fascinating, isn’t it? Is this your first fashion show, Mr. Chang-jin?”

“No, I’ve been to a few, but this is the first time I’ve been formally invited. There’s a lot to prepare.”

In his past life, he had attended a few times but had only been there in a formal capacity without much interest. But now, he found it quite different with a focused perspective.

Jin Seon-ah pulled his arm eagerly.

“Come on, let’s go. Mr. Kim is waiting.”

Backstage, Kim Bong-soo, dressed in a pristine white outfit with frills, was carefully inspecting clothes. Engrossed in his work, Jin Seon-ah approached him affectionately.

“Mr. Kim, we’re here.”

“Oh my dear, who is this? Isn’t it Seon-ah?”

Welcoming her with open arms, Kim Bong-soo gave her a light hug.

“Mr. Chang-jin, you’re here too. I’ve been wanting to thank you.”

“Pardon? What do you mean?”

“Remember the interview with journalist Joo? The suit you wore became a hot topic, and we got contacted by overseas buyers. Isn’t it unbelievable? They recognized my clothes from the other side of the world! That’s why we scheduled the fashion show earlier than planned. Originally, it was to be in spring next year. So, I wanted to thank you personally.”

“That’s not because of me. It’s all thanks to your outstanding sense, Mr. Kim.”

“No, no. I’m just a simple director. Without a great model, even the best clothes lose their elegance. Clothes only shine when worn by someone of stature.”

“Your words are quite profound.”

“Yes, there are so many beautiful dresses. But why are they all white?”

“It’s winter. To capture the winter feel, I designed everything in white. I wanted to highlight the pure and lovely aspects.”

“Simple is best. I’m really looking forward to it.”

“Wait and see my fantastic show.”

As the start time approached, preparations outside the venue were completed. Gifts for Terra Department Store VIPs and handbags for prizes were also arranged. When the opening time arrived, the host, who had been waiting, appeared on stage.

“Now, the 1975 Winter Collection is about to begin. This event is a charity for underprivileged children, and all proceeds will be donated to Angel’s Home. Shall we take a look at the lineup?”

As applause resounded, the stage lights dimmed. The fashion show was divided into two parts, with the final act by Kim Bong-soo.

Models began showcasing their outfits with powerful walks. The audience watched, mesmerized by the fashion show. However, near the end of the first part, an unexpected incident occurred.

“A major issue! A male model injured his ankle while descending from the stage.”

“What? Is that true?”

A panicked Kim Bong-soo rushed backstage to find a doctor examining the model’s ankle.

“He missed a step and fell. It’s about a 2-meter drop.”

The male model’s ankle appeared severely injured. Kim Bong-soo, worried, asked about his condition.

“Are you okay? Can you still go on stage?”

“Yes, I can. I can endure this much.”

The male model showed determination, but the doctor shook his head.

“No, he can’t. His ankle is severely sprained. Walking on stage is impossible. It seems the bone is fractured; he needs to go to the hospital immediately.”

“Do we have a replacement?”

“All the male models are already booked. We don’t have anyone available.”

“This is a disaster.”

Kim Bong-soo looked around desperately but found no suitable replacement. At that moment, a person came to his mind. Rushing back to the audience, he approached Lee Chang-jin for help.

“Mr. Lee, could you help me for a moment? We’re short of a male model, and I need you to step in.”

“What? Me? I’m not a professional model. I don’t even know how to walk the runway.”

“You tried it in the fitting room, remember? Just do it like that.”

“But still, as an amateur, going on stage...”

“Please, Mr. Lee. You’re the only suitable man for the job. Just close your eyes and do it once.”

Feeling the pressure, Lee Chang-jin looked to his side. Jin Seon-ah, who had been listening, whispered softly.

“Please help. You’re the only one who can do it, Mr. Chang-jin.”

“Alright. Where should I go?”

“Follow me.”

Backstage, Lee Chang-jin removed his suit jacket and sat at the makeup table. The makeup artist and hair stylist did their best to prepare him. Soon, the music signaling the start of the second part began, and the fashion show resumed.

“Standby, cue!”
