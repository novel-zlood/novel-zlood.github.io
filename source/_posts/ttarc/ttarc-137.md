## Episode 137: Sleeping With The Enemy

“Now, the bride’s side, please.”

Shortly after, Jin Seon-ah appeared, escorted by her father, Jin Tae-choon.

Everyone who saw Seon-ah in person couldn't help but admire her beauty.

She was even more stunning than she appeared in the commercials.

Dong-geun's mother, seated at the table, muttered in admiration.

“Oh my, she's so pretty. She looks just like me when I was a young girl.”

“Right? Our Madam Hwang was quite a beauty in Iksan.”

“Goodness, you two. You’re embarrassing me.”

Chairman Kim Cheol-ho, seemingly embarrassed by the couple's affectionate display, cleared his throat, having seemingly forgotten their earlier argument.

Unable to bear it any longer, Dong-geun hissed.

“Mom, Dad, please be quiet. Everyone's looking at us.”

Seon-ah, dressed in a pink dress, was as pretty as a picture.

The light pink dress suited her flushed cheeks perfectly.

“Both sides, please face each other and bow.”

Lee Chang-jin took out a ring he had prepared beforehand and put it on his finger. The solitaire diamond ring was simple yet sophisticated.

The diamond was huge, at least three carats.

After Chang-jin presented the ring, Seon-ah put it on his finger.

Their parents watched the scene with warm smiles.

Chang-jin and Seon-ah greeted the guests who had come to bless their future.

“We sincerely thank all the relatives and family members who attended our engagement ceremony.”

After the greetings, a three-tiered engagement cake was brought in on a tray.

Seon-ah, holding Chang-jin's hand, blew out the candles on the cake together.

The cake, lightly cut with a bread knife, was served to the guests piece by piece by the staff.

Uncle Dong-sik, who had seen Seon-ah up close, looked envious once again.

“She's an angel. Dong-geun, why don't you ask your hyung to introduce you to someone?”

“Oh, come on, Uncle. That’s ridiculous. Who would want to be set up with me?”

“Who said anything about someone like her? Seon-ah has friends, right? Ask your brother if he knows anyone. Birds of a feather flock together, you know.”

“Yes, Uncle. I'll try my best.”

Dong-geun nodded absentmindedly, his gaze fixed on the stage where the congratulatory song was being sung.

Uncle Dong-sik smiled as he watched Dong-geun stare at Young-mi, who was wearing a green dress.

“Look at that, my boy has good taste.”

After the ceremony, people were drinking champagne.

The bride and groom-to-be went around the guests' tables, clinking glasses.

The last one to take their picture was Director Yang Kuk-jin, who was in charge of filming the commercial.

“Smile! Please smile! Sir, your face is too stern.”

The parents of both families, their faces stiff, smiled awkwardly, but Kuk-jin was a pro.

He soon had everyone smiling with his lighthearted jokes.

“Everyone say kimchi!”

Director Yang finished the shoot quickly before the guests got tired.

As Chang-jin took a breather, Seon-ah brought him a glass of water.

“Here, you must be thirsty. Have some water.”

Chang-jin, who was thirsty, thanked her as he accepted the glass.

“Thank you. Is the engagement ceremony almost over?”

“Yes. You did a great job, Chang-jin-ssi.”

“You too, Seon-ah-ssi.”

Chang-jin and Seon-ah looked at each other and smiled softly.

They were exhausted from preparing for the engagement ceremony since morning, but they were happier than ever.

Looking at the rings on each other's fingers, they felt a strange sense of stability.

Jin Tae-choon watched them with a pleased look on his face.

Just then, one of the hotel staff scurried over and whispered something to Tae-choon.

“Sir, someone is here to see you.”

“Hmm? I don't think I invited anyone outside of family. Who is it?”

“Well… It’s Chairman Nam Tae-gon of Taeyang Group.”

“Tae-gon is here? I’ll go out and see him.”

When Tae-choon stepped outside, he found Tae-gon waiting.

Tae-choon greeted him with a welcoming smile and open arms.

“Well, well, Chairman Nam, what brings you here? To think that someone as busy as you would come in person. I had no idea you were interested in our family affairs. How did you know about my daughter's engagement ceremony?”

“What? Your daughter’s engagement ceremony was here?”

Tae-gon was startled and trying to grasp the situation.

Just then, Chang-jin, who had finished the ceremony, walked out of the venue.

Tae-gon froze at the sight of Seon-ah, her arm linked with Chang-jin's.

Seon-ah, who recognized Tae-gon first, greeted him.

“Hello, Chairman Nam. It's been a while.”

“Yes, Seon-ah. You've grown up so beautifully. It's been about six years. You've become quite the lady.”

Tae-gon, slightly flustered but quickly regaining his composure, pretended to know.

“Thank you. You haven't changed a bit, Chairman.”

“Anyway, let me see. So this must be your fiancé?”

“Yes. You must have seen him in the papers. This is Lee Chang-jin. He's a very successful businessman these days.”

“It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am Lee Chang-jin.”

Tae-gon groaned inwardly as he watched Chang-jin bow politely.

He knew they were close, but he never thought they would actually get engaged.

So, she wasn't just a fling?

For the notoriously picky Jin Tae-choon to approve of him, this guy must be something else.

Chang-jin greeted Tae-gon, who had a sour look on his face.

“I had no idea that the great Chairman Nam would come all this way. Thank you so much.”

Tae-gon was inwardly irritated by Chang-jin's innocent act, pretending he hadn't orchestrated this whole situation, but Chang-jin was no ordinary man either.

Hiding his discomfort, Tae-gon chuckled.

“Haha, Chairman Jin and I are old friends. I couldn't come empty-handed after hearing that his daughter is getting engaged. Here, please accept this. It's a small engagement gift.”

“Oh my, you shouldn't have. Thank you.”

The secretary accompanying him handed Seon-ah a gift wrapped in a golden cloth.

While Seon-ah, delighted, examined the gift with curiosity, Tae-gon asked Chang-jin for a moment of his time.

“Mr. Lee, congratulations on your engagement. I know you're busy, but I wonder if you could spare me a moment? I have something urgent to discuss with you regarding business.”

Trailing off, Tae-gon glanced at Seon-ah.

Chang-jin nodded nonchalantly.

“Seon-ah-ssi, would you excuse us for a moment? It seems I need to talk to Chairman Nam privately.”

“Alright. Please excuse me, Chairman.”

After saying goodbye, Seon-ah left, but Tae-choon didn't budge.

Tae-gon turned to Tae-choon and asked.

“Aren't you leaving? You must be busy.”

“No, I'm not that busy. I'm also curious about what you two have to talk about. Pretend I’m not here and carry on. That reminds me, the lounge would be a good place to talk.”

‘Jin Tae-choon, you old fox.’

It was clear that he was trying to pressure him by staying put.

Tae-gon frowned at his annoying behavior, but the situation was already in Tae-choon's favor.

Sitting across from each other in the hotel lobby cafe, Tae-gon was the first to get to the point.

“I'm sure you can guess why I'm here, and I know you're busy, so I'll get straight to the point. Let’s call a truce.”

“A truce, you say?”

“Yes. It’s strange how often our companies seem to cross paths. In a bad way, I mean. I heard there was some trouble with the chemical plant construction. And then there’s the titanium dioxide incident. There's no need for us to keep fighting like this. After all, the titanium dioxide market is a cyclical market, so it would be better for us to cooperate than to compete in a price war.”

“Hmm, what do you mean by cooperate?”

Tae-gon, swirling his coffee cup, confessed.

“To be honest, we're short on titanium dioxide inventory. My foolish son dumped our stock, so we only have a couple of months' worth of supply left. So, I was hoping you could supply us with the shortage.”

“You want me to supply my competitor with their shortage?”

“That's right. As a businessman, you know that there are no permanent enemies or friends in business. Just name your price.”

It was a bold proposition, but Chang-jin didn't refuse outright.

“Well, I'm happy to sell to Taeyang if the price is right. However, what about the mental and financial damage we suffered from your dumping? We would like to make it clear that compensation for damages is our priority before any deal can be made.”

Tae-gon, as if expecting it, nodded.

“I apologize for my incompetent son's mistake. I take full responsibility for failing to teach him properly. So, what kind of compensation do you have in mind? I'll even triple the unit price if necessary.”

“Haha, rather than material compensation… We would like your help in being selected for the overseas project bidding consortium.”

“You mean the construction project in the Middle East?”

“Yes. It would be much easier to win overseas construction projects if we could form a consortium with a reputable company like Taeyang. If you agree to that, we’ll be happy to supply Taeyang with as much as you need. At the market price, of course.”

Tae-gon looked at Chang-jin in a new light.

Any other businessman would have taken advantage of this situation to rip him off.

However, Chang-jin was not a man to be blinded by immediate profit.

‘I wish he was my son…’

Tae-gon had never envied Tae-choon despite having three sons, but this was the first time he had ever felt such envy.

Hiding his bitter disappointment, Tae-gon said.

“Hmm. It's not that difficult, but how can I be sure you’ll keep your word? I'll be the one who loses face if you go back on your word.”

“Don't worry. My father-in-law will be the witness. Isn't that right, Father?”

Tae-choon, who had been quietly observing the situation, nodded.

“I can vouch for that. It's a promise between men, even before business. But, Chairman Nam, you should keep your word as well. You should know that when I, Jin Tae-choon, set my mind on something, I get it done.”

“I know that better than anyone. Alright then, consider it a done deal. I'll send my staff to discuss the details separately.”

“Of course. We'll be happy to cooperate if Taeyang shows sincerity.”

With that, Tae-gon left the venue.

Tae-choon, who had been watching from behind, gave Chang-jin a subtle warning.

“Chang-jin, I hate to say this, but… Don't trust that sly old fox. Nam Tae-gon is the type of man who will turn his back on you the moment it suits him. He may have backed down this time because he needs our help, but he won't forget the humiliation he's suffered today.”

“Don't worry, Father. I’ve already considered that.”

Tae-gon was definitely a tiger, but he was an old tiger with few teeth left.

He might seem healthy, but he was a ticking time bomb.

Having lived through his past life, Chang-jin knew that Tae-gon's time was almost up.

He could handle a temporary truce.

He was going to take everything from Tae-gon, slowly but surely.

His revenge against Taeyang Group had only just begun.
