## Episode 89: Terra Department Store

*Beep beep...*

After a moment, a familiar voice was heard along with a clattering sound.

"Hello?"

"Oh my, Casanova? Did you have fun with the Mexican beauties last week?"

The slightly unstable tone indicated that she was somewhat peeved.

Sensing her mood, Lee Chang-jin spoke soothingly.

"How did you know I went to Mexico?"

"Oh my, you think I wouldn't know that? So, what brings you to call? You never call first when you're working. Do you need something again?"

"Haha, does there always have to be a reason? Please make some time this weekend."

"This weekend? Why?"

"I’ve been so busy with company work that we haven’t spent much time together. How about going somewhere with me?"

"Where?"

Her voice climbed sharply at the mention of going out.

"Changgyeongwon. It's the Double Ninth Festival, isn't it? The weather seems perfect for watching the autumn leaves..."

"I already have another appointment..."

It seemed she was a bit upset since he hadn't mentioned his trip to Mexico.

Sensing Jin Seon-ah's evasive attitude, Lee Chang-jin gently persuaded her.

"I know you're busy, but please make some time. I’m starting to forget what you look like. I'll be waiting for you, assuming you'll come."

"Alright. See you then."

Perhaps because it had been a while since their last date, Lee Chang-jin felt a bit excited.

But there was one problem. Digging through his wardrobe, he found that, apart from suits, all he had were stretched-out T-shirts or casual clothes from his university days.

"This is a bit much..."

Thinking back, he realized that from their first meeting until now, he had been rotating just three or four suits.

Feeling that this wasn't right, Lee Chang-jin decided to visit the Terra Department Store in Myeong-dong after a long time. As he was heading up to the men's clothing section, he heard a commotion somewhere.

"Isn't this the luxury section? What kind of department store is this? Didn't I specifically ask for a larger size?"

"But, ma'am, as you can see here, you agreed to change to size 5. We explained it last time, and you definitely bought a smaller size."

"I don't care. Just give me a refund."

There are always difficult customers everywhere. The female employee seemed at a loss, but people just averted their gaze, and no one helped.

"If this continues, it’ll be a problem, ma'am. This is already the fourth time."

"What? How dare you talk back to me? You should be on your knees apologizing! How old are you?"

Lee Chang-jin was about to just walk by, but he couldn't help but be concerned.

There are always superiors and subordinates everywhere.

The female employee looked around with a distressed expression, but the surrounding people, including the manager, just averted their eyes, and no one helped.

It wasn't her first time dealing with such customers.

The woman, whose anger had reached its peak, raised her shopping bag. The female employee closed her eyes tightly, bracing for the impending assault, but nothing happened.

At the moment the woman attempted to hit her with the shopping bag, Lee Chang-jin firmly grasped her arm.

The woman, surprised, looked up at him.

"And who are you?"

"Ma'am, for the sake of your dignity, let's leave it at that."

"Who do you think you are, butting in? Do you know who I am?"

The woman struggled to free her arm, but Lee Chang-jin didn't budge. With a cold expression, he warned her quietly.

"I don't know who you are, ma'am, but many eyes are watching. Will you step back, or do you want to go to the police for assault? I won't stop you if you want to be humiliated..."

Looking around, she finally noticed the murmuring stares.

The troublesome customer bit her lip as she realized what she had done. Judging by his attire, he wasn't just an ordinary person.

The woman, biting her lip, glared as she stepped back.

"Consider this a warning. Behave properly from now on."

As the troublesome customer left, the female employee expressed her gratitude. A moment later, when she noticed a scratch on Lee Chang-jin's hand, she became flustered.

"Are you okay? Oh no, there's a scratch on your hand..."

His hand had been scratched, possibly by the metal brooch on the bag.

His hand was red and there were small droplets of blood.

Lee Chang-jin calmly took out a handkerchief and staunched the bleeding as if nothing had happened.

"It's fine, really."

To her, Lee Chang-jin's smile seemed like that of a savior.

The female employee blushed unknowingly.

"More importantly, I came to look for some clothes. Could you help me?"

"Ah, yes..."

The female employees busied themselves measuring him.

"What about this? Or this?"

Lee Chang-jin couldn't help but feel awkward at the overly friendly service.

He tried on several outfits but wasn't satisfied with any of them.

"There's no time. Should I just buy anything and leave?"

Glancing at his watch, more than 30 minutes had passed.

Just as he was about to lose patience, a savior appeared as if on cue.

"Miss Yu, that doesn't seem to suit him..."

Turning around, he saw a woman with a handbag smiling brightly.

The startled staff bowed their heads.

"Oh, boss? What brings you here?"

"Is there somewhere I shouldn't be? This is my store, you know. I'm hurt."

"No, of course not. It's an honor to have you here."

An all-too-familiar voice reached his ears.

"Could it be?"

Clear eyes with a hint of brown. A woman as tall as a model. Lee Chang-jin spoke.

"Could it be Juhee? Nam Juhee?"

"Oh, Chang-jin oppa? It's been a long time. How many years has it been? Seven years? You've gotten even more handsome."

"And you've become quite a lady. It's good to see you."

Nam Juhee, who greeted him warmly, had a sparkle in her eyes. She was a junior from Korea University and well-known as an illegitimate daughter of Taeyang Group.

She had entered Korea University at 16 with a ranking close to the top 10 nationwide, which had been quite a sensation, but she had thoroughly hidden her connection to Taeyang Group while attending school.

When he learned the truth after graduation, he was quite surprised.

With a smile of delight, Nam Juhee spoke.

"I heard you started a company. I heard it's doing well? Congratulations, oppa."

"Thanks. You seem to be doing well too. Is this your store?"

Why would the illegitimate daughter of Taeyang Group open a store in Terra Department Store?

Seeing his puzzled look, she laughed and replied.

"It originally belonged to my mother, but she passed it down as she got older. There are professional managers. Besides, there's no better way to understand market trends. It's like market research on competitors. I’m interested in department stores and large marts, so I need to learn step by step to manage larger operations in the future."

"That's just like you."

"I’ll take that as a compliment. It looks like you're choosing clothes. Can I help you pick?"

"Would that be alright?"

For Lee Chang-jin, it was a welcome offer. Juhee carefully selected clothes for him, as if choosing for herself.

"For someone as classically handsome as you, oppa, this tailored coat suits you. Something more elegant and classic would be good. Adding a retro item to a simple look for a point..."

She picked out a wool trench coat, a herringbone-patterned cardigan, and a textured red scarf. When he tried them on, a sophisticated autumn man stood before the mirror.

Even compared to the styles of the 2010s, the outfit was impressively modern.

Lee Chang-jin was amazed by his own appearance.

The employees were also impressed.

His outfit and appearance were as good as any top model.

Applause erupted from nearby.

"Fantastic! It really suits you."

With her enthusiastic reaction, the female employees nearby also gave him a thumbs-up.

"It really suits you. You look like an actor. I have a good eye, don't I?"

Feeling subtly proud of her coordination, Nam Juhee's choice pleased Lee Chang-jin. As he went to pay, Nam Juhee shook her head.

"Why are you trying to pay? I'm the store owner. Consider it a gift."

"Oh, I feel bad taking it for free..."

Nam Juhee gently said,

"It's fine. It's a thank you for helping our employee earlier. Actually, that person is connected to our company, so it was difficult for me to step in. Thank you for stepping in for me."

Nam Juhee winked playfully. It seemed she had seen everything earlier. Knowing her personality, Lee Chang-jin nodded obediently.

"Alright, I'll accept it thankfully."

"Come by our store often. We'll treat you like a VIP. Here's my card."

"Haha. Thanks."

As Lee Chang-jin left gracefully, Nam Juhee looked slightly regretful.

"I should have made a move, even if it seems he has a girlfriend."

* * *

The next day, a silver car was parked in the middle of Myeong-dong intersection, and a woman in an edgy trench coat and jeans was showing off her legs.

At that moment, a man in a coat walked toward her from a distance.

Whether it was because it was unusual to see Lee Chang-jin dressed up or because his transformation was new, Jin Seon-ah was the first to recognize him.

"Oh, this is the first time seeing you like this. Do you have any clothes other than suits?"

Lee Chang-jin, who had only worn suits for almost a year, laughed and replied.

"Haha, don't tease me. Do you think I wear suits all the time?"

Jin Seon-ah, who was glancing up and down, muttered discontentedly.

"Well, it's refreshing. Still, men look best in suits..."

"What did you say?"

When Lee Chang-jin asked, unable to hear, Jin Seon-ah quickly covered up with a nonchalant expression.

"Oh, nothing. I just said it looks good on you. But what happened to your hand?"

"Oh, it's just a minor scratch. It's nothing."

"Let me see. Oh my, it's scratched. Where did you get this?"

When Jin Seon-ah looked surprised, Lee Chang-jin casually covered the wound.

"No, I just tripped on the asphalt. It's not a big deal, so don't worry about it."

"How can I not worry? Let me see."

Her eyes seemed to demand an explanation, but Lee Chang-jin held his tongue. He was concerned that the conversation might go on too long.

Seeing him trying to hide it, Jin Seon-ah sighed with concern.

"You're hopeless. Be more careful next time. What's the itinerary for today? Changgyeongwon and where else?"

"You'll find out when we get there. Just follow me."

The first place Lee Chang-jin took Jin Seon-ah was Changgyeongwon. Until its demolition in 1983, Changgyeongwon was used as a zoo and was a rare amusement park for the common folk, who lacked proper leisure facilities in Seoul.

The colorful autumn leaves created a picturesque scene. Perhaps because the weather was clear, Changgyeongwon was crowded with families on an outing.

"Oh, look at that. So cute."

A penguin waddled adorably.

Seeing Jin Seon-ah react like a child, Lee Chang-jin asked curiously,

"Have you not been to places like this often?"

"No, this is actually my first time at a zoo. After I almost got lost as a child, my father didn't let me go to crowded places."

Inside Changgyeongwon, they came across a chrysanthemum exhibition by university horticulture students.

"This is my first time coming to a place like this."

"Really? I thought you’d have been popular in school... Never been here on a date?"

"My father didn't allow dating. He said dating is a luxury for students... Even in college, I couldn’t date properly because I went to a women's university."

"That’s lucky for me..."

As she smelled the vibrant hydrangeas, Jin Seon-ah asked Lee Chang-jin,

"More importantly, are you really okay?"

"With what?"

"My job."

"Why bring that up all of a sudden?"

"You're on TV and in the newspapers now. I’m asking if it's okay for you to date someone like me, who works in private finance."

Her voice carried both anxiety and nervousness.

To reassure her, Lee Chang-jin smiled softly.

"Money itself is neither good nor evil. For society to function, money must circulate, right? I don’t think private finance is bad. Every system has its reason for existence."

Private finance is often called a "necessary evil," but in Japan, it's referred to as "firefighters." Japanese money lenders call themselves firefighters because they lend money to people who need urgent funds, putting out their financial fires.

In fact, many Korean companies in the 70s relied heavily on private loans for short-term operating funds due to the complexity of bank procedures and lack of collateral. Almost no Korean companies were free from using private finance.

Of course, there were many who exploited the system, but there were also those who were rescued by it.

Thus, systems are like two sides of a coin. Though he once had a negative view of private finance, long years of life had taught him that the world couldn’t be seen in black and white.

"Actually, I’m grateful."

"Why?"

"Meeting you was a stroke of luck for me. Sure, I took a risk, but winning someone as wonderful as you always involves some risk."

With a half-closed gaze, Jin Seon-ah asked,

"You really have a way with words. How many have you charmed with that talk?"

"Just one. Why waste time charming many? I didn’t have the time for casual dating or the interest. I invest my time in someone truly attractive. Time is money, after all."

At his playful response, Jin Seon-ah probed further.

"Hmm. Sounds like you’ve had practice."

"I’m a one-woman man. It would be unfair to think otherwise."

"Alright, I’ll believe you’re a one-woman man."

With a chuckle, Jin Seon-ah naturally linked arms with him. After enjoying the flowers, they walked down the path covered with falling leaves.

They reached the site where Korea's first outdoor music hall, Namsan Music Hall, once stood. Some young people with long hair were playing folk songs on acoustic guitars.

"The long night passes, dew on every blade of grass..."

As the song from the concrete-shell structure of the outdoor music hall drifted, the couples on dates looked up at the stage, enchanted. Lee Chang-jin stopped in his tracks, and Jin Seon-ah closed her eyes with a blissful expression.

"It's a nice song."

After enjoying dinner at a Western-style restaurant near Soongui Middle School, they went to a nearby café and ordered an ice cream. While savoring the creamy sweetness, Jin Seon-ah suddenly seemed to remember something and asked Lee Chang-jin,

"Something feels missing... Strangely, it feels empty not talking about work."

Noticing her keen observation, Lee Chang-jin smiled.

"Let’s talk about work some other time. Let's just enjoy our date today."

"No, it feels like you're hiding something. Spit it out. If I get curious, I can’t sleep at night."

"Let’s just enjoy the mood today. There's really nothing."

"It’s written all over your face. Are you trying to deceive me? If you don't tell me, I'll open your bag."

As Jin Seon-ah kept pestering him, Lee Chang-jin reluctantly took out an envelope from his bag.
