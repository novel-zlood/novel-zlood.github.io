## Episode 109: Inshallah!

After the geological survey was completed, Lee Chang-jin asked Kim Hak-do.

"First of all, did you confirm the presence of a water source?"

"Yes, according to the survey, it is estimated to be buried at a depth between 200 to 500 meters underground. We've identified the location where we plan to extract the water."

The survey results roughly identified the locations where wells could be installed. The plan was to install wells near suitable water sources close to the farm and then pump the groundwater through pipes. However, Chief Seo, who was in charge of the field operations, showed reluctance.

"Mr. Lee, your enthusiasm is admirable, but extracting water from that depth is no joke. We need to drill at least 100 meters for the well, and do you know how much that costs? If we make a mistake, the cost could exceed the benefits."

Consultant Hong In-young, who was also present, agreed with that opinion.

"Yes, I also oppose this. To extract water from an aquifer and install a well, you can't use ordinary equipment. Moreover, it's not a one-time job. Renting the equipment alone costs about $100,000 a month, and you need to drill at least ten wells. If we fail, the additional costs will exponentially increase the time and expenses."

In reality, the surface water used for residential purposes typically involved drilling depths of 20~30m. However, developing deeper wells required much deeper drilling, necessitating several times the cost.

The process would incur considerable expenses, including drilling, construction, installation of electric pumps, and tanks. They even inquired with local companies, but the responses were unanimous.

"We're sorry, but we've never drilled to that depth before, so it would be challenging for us."

When the situation seemed unfavorable, Chief Seo sighed and muttered.

"Mr. Lee, I think you're being a bit too ambitious this time. Unless it's an oil drilling company, how many companies can drill wells hundreds of meters deep? Without calling in a company like Exxon or Mobil, extracting water would be impossible."

At those words, a thought flashed through Lee Chang-jin's mind like lightning.

Lee Chang-jin clapped his hands unconsciously.

"That’s a great idea, Chief Seo."

"Mr. Lee, did you even listen to what I said? Were you dozing off?"

"No, I mean the oil drilling companies. If we can't manage, we can bring in the drilling equipment."

"Hey, I was just joking. Do you have any idea how much it would cost to rent that equipment?"

Lee Chang-jin replied with a smile.

"There's no such thing as impossible. Do you remember the Pohang oil incident two years ago? Can't we bring in the equipment used in that operation?"

Chief Seo and Consultant Hong looked at each other in surprise.

Two years ago, there was an incident that stirred the whole nation when oil was reportedly discovered in Korea. Samcheok Industries was a company hastily formed by the Central Intelligence Agency to drill for oil.

In fact, it all stemmed from the President’s remark.

"Isn’t it still uncertain whether there’s no oil in Korea? Don’t hesitate and look for it. If you dig hard enough, you might get unexpected results."

Logically, experts believed the probability of oil in Korea was very low. The geological structure that could contain oil, known as a trap, was hard to find in Korea.

However, the Central Intelligence Agency couldn’t ignore the supreme leader’s obsession with oil.

The CIA formed a team and brought in an oil drilling rig from the U.S. that could drill down to 5,000 meters, starting a large-scale development plan. This included over 20 American petroleum technicians, 3 engineers from a logging company named X-Logging, and even drillers from Denver, Colorado, who were involved in gas development.

Despite months of continuous effort, no significant results were achieved until news suddenly came from Pohang that oil had been discovered.

Energized by the unexpected news, the CIA immediately launched extensive support. However, the problem arose afterward. After the press release, Yucon drilled but found no oil.

Startled, the CIA didn’t give up and started drilling a new well, DS1, about 50 meters northwest of well B where oil had been found.

However, even after drilling beyond 1,000 meters and approaching 1,475 meters where oil was found, only a fluorescence response from oil quality was observed, with no significant results.

The CIA continued drilling at 50-meter intervals, but no oil was found. Ultimately, the drilling operation ended in failure after the third well drilled down to 2,176 meters.

The story of oil being discovered in Pohang was soon buried as if it never happened.

"Isn't the basic principle of oil drilling and groundwater development the same? Then, if we just clean the pipes and change the drilling tips, there should be no problem with the well drilling, right?"

"That's true, but... do you think the government would lend it to us?"

"Unless drilling is still ongoing, everything stopped after the Pohang oil incident. The equipment is likely idle, so it wouldn’t hurt to ask. I'll give it a try."

When Lee Chang-jin contacted Seong Gong-cheol, he asked in surprise.

"Oil drilling equipment, you say? Did you secure an oil drilling project in Saudi Arabia?"

"Haha, no, I'm just looking to find a groundwater vein for a water source, but we lack the proper equipment. Can we borrow the idle equipment? I'll pay a fair price."

Seong Gong-cheol laughed heartily.

"Haha, I thought you secured a project. You don’t need to worry about the rental fee; just take it and use it. The equipment is still left at the Pohang drilling site, so feel free to use it. No cost involved."

"Really, is that okay?"

"Yes, we don’t want to see that equipment anymore. We'll be grateful if you clean it up. It’s been a headache for the Pohang residents and us, so it’s actually good news."

After the oil drilling efforts ended in a dismal failure, the drilling team was disbanded, and the incident became a dark chapter for the CIA. They wanted to erase the event since it resulted in no achievements despite all the commotion.

The equipment used was left to rust in the sea breeze, becoming eyesores.

However, dismantling them would cost a lot, so when Lee Chang-jin came with a welcome proposal, the CIA was happy to oblige. Lee Chang-jin also hurried the process, fearing they might change their minds.

"Manager Yoon, you should return to Korea immediately. I know it's a hassle, but start the dismantling process as soon as you get back."

"Understood."

While the dismantling team disassembled the drilling equipment, Lee Chang-jin searched for drilling experts with experience. Someone had to oversee the drilling operation.

Coincidentally, Manager Seong Gong-cheol recommended someone.

"Ah, there's a perfect candidate. His name is Kwak Do-hyun, a mining company employee who was on duty during the Pohang oil discovery. He was diligent and promising but got caught up in the Pohang oil incident."

"Such a person... Thank you for the recommendation."

Lee Chang-jin called Deputy Manager Jung Pil-ju to find Kwak Do-hyun.

"Did you find out what he's up to?"

"Yes, after being fired from the public company, he’s been unemployed. It seems someone higher up needed a scapegoat. He's been staying home ever since."

"That's great."

With Daese Construction's scouting offer, the unemployed Kwak Do-hyun gratefully accepted. He flew to Saudi Arabia as soon as he received his passport.

"Thank you. I will work tirelessly."

"Haha, no need to overwork yourself. If you get hurt, I will be responsible. Just do your job properly."

"Mr. President, what happens to me after the water development is completed?"

"Don't worry about that. We have plenty of places that need you. Even after the drilling is done, you'll continue working with the construction company."

"Thank you."

Lee Chang-jin had the drilling equipment cleaned and modified to the appropriate well size.

Meanwhile, Lee Dong-geun, the head of Daese Agricultural Cooperative, searched for the personnel Yang Hyun-wook requested from Korea. The only condition Lee Chang-jin set for hiring employees was simple.

"I'll provide the basic expenses and a few months' salary in advance. If the farming succeeds, I'll also give a performance bonus. I'll support you fully, so do your best."

Yang Hyun-wook and the workers diligently sowed seeds. Of course, farming in the desert was more challenging and difficult than expected. Even if they drilled wells, improving the acidic soil to produce vegetables was no easy task.

The seeds often dried up before sprouting, and the extreme temperature differences, from 50°C during the day to 7°C at night, and the desert sandstorms often buried the cabbage fields.

For the first three months, there was no progress.

Though it was a situation that could cause anxiety, Lee Chang-jin instead expanded the irrigation facilities and encouraged the workers.

During that time, Yang Hyun-wook learned through practical experience that growing vegetables in the desert required special fertilizers and irrigation facilities.

Finally, in the fourth month, a miracle occurred as tender green sprouts emerged from the sandy soil.

"It's sprouting! It really sprouted!"

"Inshallah!!"

It was a valuable result achieved after working tirelessly with only 2~3 hours of sleep per day.

Yang Hyun-wook and the workers embraced each other and cherished the moment of triumph.

A few months later, the alfalfa farm transformed into a field of cabbages and radishes.

As the news of successful vegetable cultivation in the desert spread, the farm became a hot spot.

Local media also highlighted it as a remarkable achievement.

"Growing cabbages in the desert. A miracle becomes reality."

The alfalfa farm acquired by Lee Chang-jin quickly became a famous landmark in Saudi Arabia. After the first harvest and media coverage, phone calls flooded in from all over. Naturally, the price of cabbages skyrocketed.

Some radishes weighed up to 15kg, and at $1.50 per kg, a single radish could sell for about 27,000 won.

The once barren desert soil continued to produce fresh green vegetables.

For Korean workers in the Middle East, kimchi made from fresh cabbages was a true blessing.

The vegetables grown in the middle of the desert sold like hotcakes.
