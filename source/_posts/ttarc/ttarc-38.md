## Episode 38: Overseas Buyer

With one hand holding the handle of a carry-on suitcase and the other holding a tray with coffee, Manager Seong stood there. Seeing Lee Chang-jin at a loss for words due to the unexpected encounter, Seong Gong-cheol smiled warmly.

"Haha, were you surprised? It's been a while."

"No, Manager Seong. What brings you here...? Ah, please have a seat."

"Ah, thank you."

Lee Chang-jin, who had shaken hands with Seong, hurriedly pulled out a chair for him.

Expressing his gratitude, Seong Gong-cheol immediately sat down.

"I'm here on a business trip. Work has been busy these days. By the way, I received the red ginseng you sent. My father was very pleased. Did you have any issues with your departure?"

"No, no. Actually, I was a bit worried since it was the first time abroad for my companions, but thankfully, there were no problems. The visas came out quicker than I expected."

"That's good to hear. I did put in a word just in case there were any issues, but it seems my worries were unnecessary."

The Central Intelligence Agency handled a wide range of tasks back then. Beyond its primary security duties, it extended its reach across domestic and international intelligence gathering, espionage, and even politics, economics, and social affairs, encompassing national policies as well. Lee Chang-jin could now understand why they had gotten their visas so easily.

"Ah, so it was thanks to you, Manager..."

In fact, for people like Ku Chang-dong, old man Shin, or Park Yong-pal, getting a visa without a reference wasn't easy. Even among Anyang Steel employees, there were those who had trouble getting a visa, making it a fairly stringent process at that time.

However, for Seong Gong-cheol, who was the security audit head for top-tier overseas posts like the U.S., France, the U.K., and Germany, it was no big deal. Feeling the immense power of authority once again, Lee Chang-jin lowered his head.

"I didn't know, and I don't know how to thank you."

Dressed in an ordinary suit like a typical traveler, Seong Gong-cheol smiled kindly.

"Haha, I didn't do much. You did well, President Lee. By the way, I heard briefly earlier... They said the atmosphere at the Korean exhibition hall at Messe is a bit down. Is there anything I can help with?"

Judging by his keen interest, it was clear he already knew everything. Without any reason to hide, Lee Chang-jin honestly revealed the situation. Listening attentively, Seong Gong-cheol soon nodded.

"Hmm, it's a significant exhibition that even the high-ranking government officials are interested in. That's indeed a problem. I'll pitch in to help."

"Can you really do that?"

"Of course. Businesspeople like you, President Lee, are the true patriots. If it's something that helps the export industry, I should naturally step in."

"It's not as easy as it sounds... Thank you for your consideration."

After a while, Seong Gong-cheol glanced at his wristwatch and stood up. Lee Chang-jin also got up.

"Are you leaving already?"

"I've had my caffeine, so I should get going. I have a lot of work piled up. Enjoy your meal."

Waving his hand, Seong Gong-cheol soon disappeared in a black car.

That evening, an official document was promptly responded to by the embassy.

Early the next morning, as soon as dawn broke, a vehicle loaded with souvenirs and traditional costumes and instruments arrived at Anyang Steel's booth. Manager Eom looked bewildered at the sight.

"These people are unbelievable. Yesterday, they were talking as if nothing would work."

Feigning ignorance, Lee Chang-jin spoke nonchalantly.

"President Yoo must have pulled some strings. It shows that the government is also paying close attention to this event."

"Is that so? I don't know what exactly happened, but I feel like I lost ten years of my life. Let's move quickly!"

Lee Chang-jin and his team moved the delivered souvenirs indoors and decided to conduct a brief rehearsal in the performance studio room of the Messe Center.

Wearing traditional Korean costumes and equipped with instruments like the kkwaenggwari and jing, they looked quite the part. However, perhaps because it was early morning, the main performer, Seo Yo-han, kept making mistakes. Unable to bear it any longer, Ku Chang-dong yelled.

"Is this the skill that won the gold medal? Get your act together!"

"I'm sorry. My body hasn't fully warmed up yet..."

"Tsk tsk. Excuses. Alright, let's do it properly! Everyone, one more time."

The team, intimidated by Ku Chang-dong's strict demeanor, froze. Sensing the tense atmosphere, Lee Chang-jin approached and started a conversation.

"Hmm, how's the preparation going?"

"Not quite there yet. Since it's been a while for everyone, the timing is a bit off."

"Don't try to be perfect. Just think of it as a fun game at a school sports day. Take your time and prepare step by step. There's no need to rush to finish by the morning. Everyone hasn't done this in years, right? You'll get the hang of it soon."

"Understood. We'll take it step by step."

Thanks to Lee Chang-jin's encouragement, the previously tense atmosphere gradually eased.

Fortunately, muscle memory is not easily forgotten. Though clumsy at first, it didn't take long for them to synchronize once the rhythm set in.

After finishing the rehearsal, they decided to perform during the lunchtime part-time slot. The performance group, consisting of kkwaenggwari, buk, janggu, and jing, took the stage. As the audience's attention was drawn to their unique attire, the host spoke.

"Everyone, please pay attention here. Today, we present traditional Korean nongak for the first time. Team Anyang Steel! Rather than explaining, it's better to see it for yourselves, so we'll skip further details."

Watching the performers bow their heads, Manager Eom looked on with a hopeful expression.

Though he didn't show it, this event was extremely significant for him. The outcome of this event could determine whether he got promoted or had to wait longer.

"Eolssu!"

With the sound of janggu sticks, the performance officially began. Starting with a slow rhythm, the performers gradually increased the tempo in sync. As their energy built up, they matched the beat with the janggu. The initially slow rhythm transitioned to an exciting jajinmori rhythm.

As the tension eased and the performers enjoyed the moment, one of them made a critical mistake. They entered a beat too early.

In a situation that could have led to a major mishap, Ku Chang-dong's quick thinking shone. Seizing the moment of off-beat, Ku Chang-dong energetically struck his kkwaenggwari, increasing the tempo. The other performers naturally followed suit, speeding up their performance.

The off-beat rhythm transitioned smoothly into the hwimori rhythm. The sound of percussion instruments, accompanied by the steady beat, was infectious.

The lively and colorful performance captivated the audience, who unknowingly started to feel the rhythm. As the excitement grew, the performers continued with a spirited gut (ritual). The janggu's flowing melody and the buk's heavy sound blended perfectly.

The kkwaenggwari's sound grew faster, following the mesmerizing movement of the sangmo (ribbon hat). The audience's attention was drawn to the rapidly spinning sangmo. The lightning-fast spinning sangmo transformed into circles and butterfly shapes.

Stepping in a 'äº•' shape, they alternated striking the buppo or chae behind their heads from left to right so quickly it was almost invisible.

Finally, with the lingering sound of the jing, Seo Yo-han stopped moving, and thunderous applause erupted.

"Bravo!!"

"Toll, Spitze!"

For the Germans, accustomed to classical music, such a passionate performance was nothing short of sensational.

As the performers, catching their breath, were taken aback by the overwhelming response, the audience began chanting.

"Encore, encore!!"

After performing two encores, the performers received a standing ovation as they left the stage.

Faces flushed with excitement, the performers were drenched in sweat.

Taking off his janggu, Ku Chang-dong, panting heavily, asked urgently.

"Was it alright, boss? We missed a beat in the middle... Was it awkward?"

"It was fantastic. I didn't notice any mistakes."

"Indeed. It was the best performance I've ever seen!"

With Manager Eom's encouraging words, the performers' faces brightened.

Giving a thumbs-up, Lee Chang-jin said.

"That's right. Chief Seo, you looked like a completely different person on stage. You were amazing."

"Thank you, boss. We made a lot of mistakes during rehearsals, but it turned out better than expected. I'm glad the response was positive."

The performers were filled with pride from the continuous praise. As they wrapped up, Manager Eom energetically shouted.

"Alright, we need to make a mark too! Are we going to fall behind? Let's work hard and make this exhibition a success!"

"Yes, sir!"

Perhaps due to the impact of the earlier performance, there was a noticeable increase in people interested in the Korean booth.

Visitors who were deeply impressed by the lunchtime performance started visiting the Korean booth in the afternoon.

Besides the embassy staff on special duty, even helpers who had rushed over through an SOS joined the promotion. Many of them were miners and nurses dispatched from Korea, and some were international students studying abroad.

While education in Germany was free, living expenses and food were not. Students had to cover these costs themselves, so most were working mini-jobs like cleaning or restaurant assistance. These mini-jobs, often unregistered (Schwarz Job), rarely offered legal protection.

Such mini-jobs had fierce competition, and missing even a day or two could mean losing the job. Despite this, Korean students voluntarily risked their jobs to offer their help for free.

Hearing that there was no additional budget beyond travel expenses, Lee Chang-jin felt deeply sorry.

"I'm sorry. We don't have a budget allocated, so there's not much we can offer."

"Haha, it's fine. I didn't realize it while in Korea, but living abroad has increased my patriotism. If Korea does well, we get treated better too. I hope this event helps Korea gain more recognition in Europe."

With the Korean students proficient in German taking turns to help, the Korean booth became more lively. As they distributed embassy-prepared souvenirs to VIPs, it wasn't long before potential buyers started appearing among the visitors.

Noticing a group inspecting the vacuum dryer, Seo Yo-han whispered to Lee Chang-jin.

"Boss, those people seem like buyers."

"Ah, from which country?"

"I heard them speaking French earlier, so they seem to be French. But we don't have anyone who speaks French here... We might need to call a translator."

"No need. I can handle basic conversations. I'll take care of it."

With a welcoming smile, Lee Chang-jin approached them. Addressing a middle-aged white man closely inspecting the vacuum dryer, he began in fluent French.

"Bonjour, is there anything you're interested in?"

"Ah, hello. I'm glad someone speaks French. Is that a vacuum dryer? It looks very different from the ones I'm familiar with. The manual says so, but I just wanted to make sure."

Nodding his head in curiosity, the curly-haired man asked. Lee Chang-jin confidently replied.

"Ah, this? It's a newly developed prototype. We just completed the international patent for it. It's a fresh piece of equipment."

"Oh, is that so? A new product. What type of drying is it used for?"

"It's used for drying industrial high-pressure cables. This is about 1/5th the size of the original. The functions are the same."

"Oh... that's intriguing. But it looks similar to a safe. Did you use that structure?"

"Yes. You have a keen eye."

"Hmm, but it seems to be made of special steel, which must be costly to produce."

"Haha, absolutely not. With our latest technology, we can produce this at over a third less cost than traditional vacuum dryers."

The man, who had been inquisitive, asked again with interest.

"Is that so? Then can it dry other items besides cables?"

"What kind of items are you referring to?"

"Well, I was wondering if it could dry fruits like apples or vegetables like peppers and cucumbers. We run a food company, and if it can dry cables, I thought it might work for other items as well."

This was an unexpected question for Lee Chang-jin. Initially, the design focused solely on cable drying, and they hadn't considered other applications.

However, Lee Chang-jin was a sales pro. He responded naturally as if he had anticipated such a question.

"Of course. Let me show you a demonstration. Please wait a moment."

Excusing himself, Lee Chang-jin went straight to old man Shin.

"Elder, can we adjust the pressure and temperature of our dryer?"

"Of course, but why?"

"Those people seem to be executives from a French food company and are quite interested in our vacuum dryer. How about we do a quick demonstration with some fruits or vegetables?"

old man Shin responded with a hint of disbelief.

"Hey, you should have informed me in advance. How can you tell me this now?"

"Haha, I'm sorry. But how could I have predicted this situation? It's unexpected, but please. Is it possible?"

"It's possible... but I'm not sure how well it will work since we haven't tried it."

Sensing old man Shin's lack of confidence, Lee Chang-jin encouraged him.

"Come on, you can do it. Just control the temperature so it doesn't burn. I'll bring some firm items that won't lose shape."

"Alright, alright. I'll do it. But if it works, you'll have to pay for the service."

"Of course. I'll leave it to you, Elder. Hello, Assistant Manager Ku! Come over here right now."

Lee Chang-jin quickly called Assistant Manager Ku, who was in the middle of customer service, via radio. Hearing his voice, Assistant Manager Ku rushed over.
