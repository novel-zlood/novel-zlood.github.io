## Episode 40: Turning Point

Lee Chang-jin fell into deep thought at the question.

Suddenly, he recalled the first time he left his job in his past life.

"Hmm. The reason... there isn't a particular reason. I just wanted to test my limits beyond the fence of a company."

"Your limits?"

"Yes. In truth, a company isn't a place where an individual can freely display their abilities. Certain autonomy is guaranteed, but it's within a limited scope. I found that quite frustrating. I didn't want to stay a salaryman forever by conforming to organizational culture. So, I chose a way of life that suited my personality."

"Weren't you afraid? Leaving a stable job and jumping into society blindly?"

"Well, rather than being afraid... honestly, I was excited. My dream since childhood was to become a big entrepreneur. My family was very poor when I was young, so I had a strong desire for money, to be honest. Moreover, although it's embarrassing to say it myself, I had this kind of 'silly philosophy.'"

"What kind of philosophy?"

"The belief that everyone has a mission given to them. For our country to escape being a small, weak nation, economic development is essential, right? If everyone has their role in life, I thought that contributing to economic development and job creation as an entrepreneur was my path. In the international community, wealth is national power."

Feeling the atmosphere becoming solemn, Lee Chang-jin looked around.

The gazes of the people watching him were now mixed with admiration and envy.

Lee Chang-jin suddenly felt a sense of familiarity.

It was a gaze he used to encounter often. The gaze the world had towards him when he was thriving in his past life before he hit rock bottom. Back then, he took such treatment for granted.

I've come this far as a result of my relentless efforts, so maybe I deserve this kind of treatment.

But now, Lee Chang-jin was clearly aware.

That his success wasn't solely due to his own efforts.

Everyone has a noble value, even if the size or type of their dream is different. Especially those who came to Germany, they all crossed thousands of miles alone to realize their dreams.

Lee Chang-jin, wanting to help them even a little on their path to their goals, was never stingy in sharing his experiences.

As people were getting ready to leave after the meal, Lee Chang-jin handed out envelopes he had prepared.

"Here, this is a small token of my appreciation."

The people who received the unexpected envelopes checked the amount and their eyes widened.

The money in the envelope was 100 marks.

It was a large sum, enough to cover a month's living expenses, and the people were delighted as if they had struck gold.

Seeing this, Manager Eom had a worried expression.

"You rascal, no matter how much money you've made, isn't this too extravagant? Why did you put so much?"

"Haha, money can always be earned again. Look at how happy they are. Doesn't it warm your heart?"

"Geez. You make me look like the bad guy."

Grumbling, Manager Eom took out a money envelope from his pocket.

"Oh, did you prepare one too, hyung?"

"You think you're the only one with a conscience? We all chipped in. Don't try to take all the credit."

"Haha, understood, hyung."

As Lee Chang-jin was about to get into his car after saying goodbye, the man who had asked the question earlier blocked his way.

"Mr. Lee, please wait a moment."

"What is it?"

"I'd like to ask for your autograph."

The man, who had brought a fountain pen and a white paper, was panting. Embarrassed, Lee Chang-jin politely declined.

"An autograph? I'm not a celebrity, why would you want my autograph..."

Despite Lee Chang-jin's refusal, the man with glasses persisted.

"No, I have a good eye for people, and I'm sure you'll become very successful. In the future, I might not even be able to meet you, so I'd like to get your autograph in advance."

"Haha, I appreciate the sentiment, but this is really overwhelming. I'm just a novice as an entrepreneur."

The man then spoke seriously.

"No, thanks to you, I've made up my mind. I was hesitating whether to return home after failing to get into the research institute, but you've given me the courage. I'm going to try again."

"Alright, then what should I write? Your name?"

"It's Kang Jong-hee. Please write, 'In a life of challenge, there is no failure.'"

As Lee Chang-jin wrote the requested words and his autograph with the fountain pen, he handed it back, saying,

"Stay strong. I wish you luck on your journey ahead."

"Thank you so much. I'll keep this autograph as a family heirloom. Please remember me, Mr. Lee. I, too, will succeed and become a world-renowned scientist."

Though he had a small stature and a plain, rustic appearance, his eyes were sparkling.

Lee Chang-jin didn't dislike the passion burning in this man.

"Alright, Jong-hee, I wish you the best of luck."

Sometimes, a single word can change a person's life. Lee Chang-jin didn't realize it, but this moment was indeed a turning point in Kang Jong-hee's life.

Years later, when Kang Jong-hee became the first Korean director of the Max Planck Institute and a world-renowned scholar, he recalled this moment.

He said that one word had changed his life.

When Lee Chang-jin returned to Korea after finishing all his work, it was June, just as the summer heat was starting to rise.

* * *

After a 13-hour long flight, they were greeted by the humid air upon returning to Korea. Though Seoul was filled with fine dust due to the exhaust fumes and factory smoke emitted 24/7 without dust collectors, the returning people's faces were very bright. Shin Elder knelt down and kissed the ground of his homeland in delight.

"Finally, I'm stepping on the soil of my homeland."

"Geez, Elder, if someone saw you, they would think you were a prisoner returning from a foreign country. Do you like Korea that much?"

"Of course. No matter how good a developed country is, home is the best. Look at this soil, the smell and texture are completely different."

"Haha, your energy is fully restored. Now, flying isn't a big deal, right?"

"What are you talking about! Do you want to kill me twice? I'm never getting on a plane again!"

At Shin Elder's vehement refusal, Yong-pal teased him with a mischievous expression.

"Oh, come on. Elder, when you retire, let's go on a trip to Europe together. I'll take good care of you."

"You crazy boy, what do you mean take care of me? Do you want me to die and have my body shipped back? If you think I'll keep a parasite like you around until then, you're mistaken. Stop daydreaming and do your job properly."

"Why are you taking my offer in such a negative way, Elder? You're so twisted."

"You brat, are you saying I should pay for the meal and the travel expenses? What about my retirement? Will you take responsibility for it? I can see right through you! Don't try any tricks. I'll sew that mouth of yours shut if you keep it up."

As Shin Elder hit Yong-pal on the back, Yong-pal exaggerated his pain.

"Ouch, your hands are still strong. Elder, stop hitting people."

"You're a big guy, what hurts? Stop lying."

Watching them, Lee Chang-jin smiled gently.

"When you retire, let me know. I'll send you wherever you want to go. By the way, Manager Eom, are you going straight home?"

"Yes, the company has given me a few days off to rest. But I forgot my wife's gift. What was it, Rubyton?"

"Louis Vuitton."

"Anyway, she asked for one of those. Damn, I must have left my mind somewhere. You guys go ahead, I'll stop by the department store to pick up a bag and some gifts."

"Haha. Alright, see you next time. Everyone else, you can head straight home. You've worked hard. Take the next three days off and recharge. See you on Monday."

"Yes, sir. You rest well too, boss!"

After a simple farewell, the group parted ways in front of the airport.

‘I wonder how Dong-geun is doing?’

By now, the inspector exam should be over. He was curious about how he was doing.

When he arrived in front of the Yoojin Shopping Center, the manager greeted him warmly upon seeing his car.

"Hello, boss. Long time no see."

"You look well. How have you been?"

"I'm always the same. Did you go somewhere far?"

"Ah, I was on a business trip. Is my brother doing well? Has he adapted to Seoul?"

"Ah, your brother? Of course. There's nothing to worry about. He's so polite and sociable that everyone in the neighborhood knows him. He's a hardworking young man, and everyone praises him."

Hearing that, Lee Chang-jin felt a sense of pride. He took out a box of candy and chocolates from the passenger seat and handed it to the manager.

"Thank you for looking after him. By the way, I brought this from my trip. Please have a taste."

"Oh, you shouldn't have... This is so precious..."

What Lee Chang-jin brought was none other than Godiva chocolates. Until overseas travel became common in the late 1980s, going abroad was like a dream for ordinary people. It was customary for those who traveled abroad to bring back lots of gifts.

"Then, I look forward to your continued support."

"Of course. Take care."

The delighted security guard bowed deeply.

After parking his car, Lee Chang-jin went up to his apartment with his car keys.

When he opened the door and went inside, he didn't hear any signs of life.

"Dong-geun, oppa is home. Are you here?"

Seeing no response, Lee Chang-jin put down his luggage and looked around the apartment. The well-organized interior was spotless. As he admired the shiny, clean interior, he thought to himself,

‘This guy is so meticulous. He could start a cleaning business.’

As he looked around, Lee Chang-jin checked the refrigerator. There were neatly labeled containers of food. The kitchen was also in perfect condition. After confirming that Dong-geun wasn't home, Lee Chang-jin changed his clothes.

The house was very quiet. Curious about the slightly open door of Dong-geun's room, Lee Chang-jin peeked inside. The room was very neatly organized.

On one wall, there was a poster of Cheryl Tiegs in a bikini, spraying water. She was a symbol of pure glamour in the 70s. Lee Chang-jin reminisced for a moment.

His gaze then moved to the desk.

Next to the stand was a triangular calendar.

Important dates were marked with red colored pencils, and there were a few neatly arranged books beside it. All of them looked old, probably bought second-hand.

As he looked around the room, Lee Chang-jin's eyes fell on the desk.

‘This guy has been studying hard.’

The book left open was about poultry farming. It was so worn out that it looked like it had been read countless times. Next to the book was an open notebook, filled with neat, meticulous handwriting.

Lee Chang-jin picked up the notebook and glanced through it. It was filled with detailed notes about different types of chickens, feeding methods, the ratio of mixed feed, the temperature required for laying, artificial insemination methods, as well as slaughter rates, hatch costs, how to install chicken coops and cages, and more.

After a while, a plan fell out of the notebook.

‘Hmm, what's this?’

Curious, Lee Chang-jin picked up the plan. It was a cross-sectional drawing of a breeding house and elevated chicken coop. The plan included details like control panels, laying nests, waterers, feeders, and ventilation windows, complete with measurements.

The plan explained the design for ventilation, cage arrangement, specifications for chick and juvenile cages, as well as the layout of the breeding house, feed storage, multipurpose room, etc. Although there were some errors in the detailed parts, it was a nearly perfect design.

Lee Chang-jin's eyes then moved to the bottom of the notebook. There, detailed costs for a 10,000-bird coop were listed. The total estimated cost was 8.25 million won, including land prices. There was a specific goal of saving 90% of his monthly income to build the coop within three years.

After reading the notebook in one go, Lee Chang-jin couldn't help but laugh.

‘Wow, this kid. He's more diligent than I thought. He’s been dreaming big all by himself.’

He always knew that Dong-geun was a hardworking guy, but he didn't expect him to be preparing this thoroughly. Although there were some amateurish points from a professional's perspective, it was impressive.

‘But where is he now that the exam is over?’

Feeling bored after waiting for a while, Lee Chang-jin got into his car and headed to the Yeongcheon factory.

When Lee Chang-jin suddenly showed up, Ye Jin-joo mumbled in surprise.

"Aren't you supposed to start work tomorrow, boss? Why are you here already? You should rest."

"I couldn't sleep and felt bored. Where are all the employees? The office seems quieter than usual."

"Oh, they all went out on site visits and haven't returned yet. Would you like a cup of coffee?"

"No, it's fine. I'll just stay for a bit and leave. Is there anything special to report?"

"No, nothing special. But what's all that stuff, boss?"

As Ye Jin-joo took the bags from him, Lee Chang-jin explained.

"Oh, these are gifts for the employees. Simple snacks and chocolate sets for everyone to take when they leave."

"They'll love it."

"By the way, I have something special for you. This is a lipstick set from Lancôme. I hope you like it."

Ye Jin-joo's face lit up as she quickly checked the brand.

"Oh, thank you! I've wanted this for a while... Wow, it's a new product."

Delighted by the unexpected gift, Ye Jin-joo smiled brightly.

Watching her with satisfaction, Lee Chang-jin stood up.

"Alright, I'll go rest now. See you tomorrow."

"Take care."

On his way back home, Lee Chang-jin felt a pang of hunger. He stopped by Inwang Market next to Yoojin Shopping Center to buy some dumplings and tteokbokki for a snack, and shopped around while looking at the surroundings.

As he was about to cross the intersection opposite Yoojin Shopping Center, he saw Hongje Elementary School on the other side of the road. It seemed to be dismissal time as a crowd of students poured out after their morning classes.

A group of students were gathered in front of the school. Curious, he approached and saw a man squatting and selling chicks.
