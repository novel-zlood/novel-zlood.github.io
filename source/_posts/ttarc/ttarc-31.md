## Episode 31: Vacuum Dryer

"Well, what brings you here, Manager Eom?"

Manager Eom Gi-jun was the chief design manager responsible for the Anyang Steel project as the PEM (Project Engineering Manager) when Lee Chang-jin was the Lead Engineer for the machinery sector. He had imparted a lot of knowledge about the energy process to Lee Chang-jin and was a benefactor who had a close senior-junior relationship with him. Seeing Lee Chang-jin for the first time in a while, he looked quite surprised by his appearance.

"Good to see you after so long. But what’s with that outfit?"

"Ah, well, you see..."

Upon hearing the recent circumstances, Manager Eom clapped his knee in amazement.

"This guy! I hadn’t heard from you for a while, so I thought you got promoted to a managerial position, but it turns out you’ve been busy starting your own company. I was wondering why there was no news. So, you’re the president of a precision machinery company now?"

"Yes, that’s how it turned out. I apologize for not keeping in touch. But you, Manager, you're the factory manager now? Does that mean you got promoted?"

"Haha, not quite. I’m serving as both the factory manager and the head of the plant department. I haven’t been promoted yet."

Though he said that, the position of factory manager at Anyang Steel was reserved for future executive nominees. Later, the Energy Division would spin off as Anyang Energy Corporation, and Eom Gi-jun would become the first president of Anyang Power Energy. It was a position where promotion was almost guaranteed just by standing still, paving a smooth road ahead.

"Ah, congratulations. That sounds like you're on the fast track to success. I'll be counting on you, hyung."

"Rather, it's fortunate. Everyone, this man here was my co-responsible design manager for the steel plant part. He was the youngest manager in Mannheim. He's a recognized expert in engineering, especially in the machinery sector, so take note."

The employees who had gathered earlier all showed signs of admiration. Mannheim was regarded as a dream company for engineers at that time, a dream workplace for aspiring engineers. The worker who had spoken to Lee Chang-jin informally earlier came forward hesitantly.

He bowed his head, his face turning red.

"I sincerely apologize for earlier. You looked so young that I never imagined you were the president. Please forgive my rudeness."

For the worker, it was like trying to show off in front of a cocoon; he wanted to crawl into a hole. Moreover, knowing that he had a close friendship with the factory manager, he was understandably worried about any bad words getting back to him. Lee Chang-jin, guessing his thoughts, smiled and reassured him.

"No, it's understandable. More importantly, the crane maintenance work is roughly done, so please ensure regular checks during operation from now on."

"Really? Well, if the work is finished, how about a drink with me? Since you’re here, at least come and see my office."

Manager Eom led him to his office, which had a good view overlooking the factory floor and included a small meeting room. Eom personally brought coffee and handed a mug to Lee Chang-jin.

"I’m sorry I couldn’t offer more. It’s been a while since you visited, and I don’t have much to serve."

"On the contrary, I’m honored. Having a top-tier manager like you personally serve coffee, I’m not even a second-tier person, but a third-tier."

"Where do you come up with such jokes? Actually, you saved my life. When the industrial water line fell out in Mannheim, I was terrified. I owe my current position to you."

"What did I do? It’s all thanks to your good fortune, Manager."

"Haha, you have a knack for making people feel good. So, what did you think of the factory? Any advice or suggestions for improvements?"

After taking a sip of coffee, Lee Chang-jin answered Eom’s question.

"The factory layout is well-organized, and internal management is clean and good. The workers' attitudes are excellent, and the training is well done. However, based on my observations, the installed hoists and ceiling cranes seem to have issues."

"Hm? What do you mean?"

"The problem is that their size is too small compared to the operation and production volume. Most of them are being used beyond their rated load capacity. If the frequency of use exceeds the design standards, problems are inevitable. Currently, they seem fine because they haven’t been used for long, but over time, the equipment fatigue will accumulate, and the replacement cycle will speed up."

"Hmm... that’s a concern for us too. So, is there a solution?"

"Essentially, the cranes need to be replaced with ones of higher capacity. Either switch to equipment with higher tonnage or reduce the frequency of use. I recommend switching to custom-made crane systems, even if it incurs costs."

"That’s impossible. A larger crane can’t fit inside the factory. The subsidiary equipment installed makes further expansion difficult."

To operate industrial cranes, the center of gravity of the hoist (a device that moves heavy objects easily) and the crane girders supporting the hoist must be aligned. Therefore, to bring in a larger crane, the absolute height of the crane must be increased, which requires raising the factory ceiling.

However, raising the ceiling requires relocating all the subsidiary equipment and various pipelines installed on the upper floor, which would incur enormous repair costs. Manager Eom spoke.

"The issue is not just the cost but the factory layout. This building was originally supposed to be half its current size, but President Yoo opposed it, so it was expanded. The factory was built with bank loans and borrowings, and now you’re talking about remodeling again? That’s really difficult."

After pondering for a moment, Lee Chang-jin came up with a good idea.

"It seems unnecessary to use the crane in the process. Why not create a vacuum drying chamber, put the cables in it, dry them under a vacuum, and then take them out? That way, you can reduce manpower and costs, and save time."

Manager Eom nodded in agreement.

"Do you think you’re the only one with a brain? We wanted to do that too. But what can we do? There’s no such equipment in the world... Even though it looks pathetic, that equipment costs over 30 million won per unit. It’s the latest equipment commissioned from Mitsubishi in Japan."

"Mitsubishi or not, if it’s not efficient, why use it? I don’t understand why you need to repeat such cumbersome work. Instead of doing it so complexly, why not make a mold, cast it into a pot shape, install a vacuum pump, and adjust the pressure?"

Manager Eom laughed out loud as if it was an absurd idea.

"Haha, don’t be ridiculous. That’s a naive statement. If it were that easy, why wouldn’t advanced companies in the US, Germany, or Japan have thought of it? There’s no way to do it in any cable factory in the world. Moreover, where in this country can you make a proper sealed container?"

"You don’t know until you try. Let me handle the pilot order."

Manager Eom snorted at Lee Chang-jin's bold claim.

"Haha. You think you can solve a problem that even the Americans couldn’t?"

"Well, those people aren’t always right, are they? Do I look like someone who would lie about this? Just make a large sealed container, install a roots pump and a vacuum gauge, and attach a chamber. That’s all."

However, Manager Eom found it to be an extremely absurd story. At that time, Korea's technology was at a very rudimentary level. Even with forced distribution of raw materials to small companies for domestic industrial development, more than 80% of the products were defective.

They couldn’t handle vacuum packaging, let alone vacuum sealing technology. What vacuum dryer?

So, Manager Eom dismissed Lee Chang-jin’s bold claim as nonsense.

"Haha. Don’t be ridiculous. That’s just boasting. It’s nice to have ambition, but be reasonable."

Lee Chang-jin felt frustrated with Manager Eom’s skepticism. For Lee Chang-jin, who had memories of the future, it was not an impossible mission.

However, breaking the deeply ingrained prejudice in Manager Eom’s mind was not easy.

As they continued their technical debate and argument about whether it was feasible, a sudden presence was felt behind them.

"Haha, if that’s true, it would be an amazing invention..."

Turning around at the sound, they saw a middle-aged man with a bald head standing with his hands behind his back, looking amused. Next to him were three men in suits, presumably his secretary and bodyguards. Recognizing who it was, Manager Eom quickly bowed his head.

"President, what brings you here..."

"Haha, what a strange thing to say. Do I need to notify you when I’m the president?"

"It’s not that. I was just wondering why you came without any notice. You should have informed us beforehand."

The man's chuckling demeanor made Manager Eom laugh nervously.

"Haha, I was on an inspection tour and dropped by to check how things were going. I heard some interesting talk, so I couldn’t help but eavesdrop. Who is this smart and handsome young man? He seems to be a well-known engineer."

Noticing Lee Chang-jin, Manager Eom hurriedly introduced him.

"Ah, let me introduce him. This is President Yoo Joon-tae. This young man is Lee Chang-jin, who worked at Mannheim. He participated in the design of this factory and started his own business a year after leaving Mannheim. One of the cranes our company uses was supplied by him."

Lee Chang-jin bowed his head first.

"Nice to meet you, President Yoo Joon-tae. I am Lee Chang-jin of Daese Industries."

"Impressive. A young man already running a successful business. Young people like you are the future of our country. But it seems like you know me well? You don’t seem very surprised."

"As a businessman, how could I not know President Yoo? Actually, a few years ago, I served at the 25th Division as a ROTC officer. I heard of your reputation there."

"Oh... I see. This is indeed a connection."

Yoo Joon-tae couldn’t hide his joy. Lee Chang-jin was deeply moved. In his previous life, he had seen Yoo Joon-tae a few times at economic federation meetings, but only from a distance. This was the first time he had a direct conversation with him.

Yoo Joon-tae was a giant known as the "Andrew Carnegie of Korea." He was a businessman who graduated from the Military Academy. After retiring as a major general in the 1960s, he founded Anyang Integrated Steel and led the steel industry.
