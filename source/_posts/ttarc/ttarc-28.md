## Episode 28: Disaster Recovery

"Oh, Changjin is here?"

"Yes, Mother."

"Are you hungry? Sit down quickly and eat. Have you had lunch?"

"Yes. I ate with a friend who was surveying at an architectural office in town. They brought kimbap."

"Kimbap? How can a grown man be full with just that? Come, sit down quickly."

Mother wrapped a generous piece of meat with lettuce, garlic, and onions from the garden and handed it to him.

"Here, say 'ah' and take a bite. It's so delicious that one could die eating it."

"Yes, yes. I'll eat well."

As soon as Lee Chang-jin took a big bite, the smoky flavor from the charcoal grill tantalized his taste buds.

Faces full of anticipation watched him.

Unable to hold back, Father asked eagerly, "Is it good? Huh? How does it taste?"

After swallowing the bite, Lee Chang-jin gave a thumbs-up.

"It's the best! It's absolutely delicious."

Father, who beamed with a broad smile at his words, pushed a plate piled high with meat in front of him.

"That's right. Eat a lot. Everyone, we're feasting on meat because of our son. Keep that in mind! Understood?"

"Understood! No need to brag, everyone in the village knows how great your son is."

"Haha, well then. I wasn't expecting to get anything without some boasting. Everyone, raise your glasses! To Changjin's business prosperity!"

"To prosperity!"

Everyone holding makgeolli cheered in unison.

The villagers were filled with laughter at the rare meat feast.

'Yes, this is what life is all about.'

People were enjoying themselves, dancing joyfully along with Chang-sik who was swaying his shoulders.

Lee Chang-jin, watching with a contented smile, approached his uncle, Dong-sik.

"Uncle, have you talked with Dong-geun?"

"Not yet, but he’s been acting like he has something important to say tonight... I wonder what could be so important for that rascal..."

"Don't be like that. Try talking to him. Dong-geun has his own thoughts."

"Alright... But why did you go to the town again?"

"Oh, I was wondering if there was any way I could help the village. If we bring in a tractor, we’ll need to expand the road, right? So I went to town to ask for a survey."

"Is there anyone working during the holidays?"

"Well, I ran into a middle school friend. There was also a civil servant on duty at the county office, so it worked out well."

Upon hearing that, the village chief, who had been listening, chimed in.

"Wow... Changjin really is different. Expanding the road would be great for us. Is there anything we can do to help?"

"Well, once the work starts, we’ll need hands, so I’ll let you know slowly after we get the road excavation permit. By the way, is anyone from the Byeon family here?"

"Of course. Everyone in the village was invited... Isn't Gil-nam over there? The chubby guy standing in line."

Looking where the village chief pointed, there was a chubby man with a protruding belly stuffing his mouth with meat in front of the grill.

Seeing him choking, Lee Chang-jin hurriedly poured a cup of makgeolli and handed it to Byeon Gil-nam, who gulped it down and expressed his gratitude.

"Oh... It's you, Changjin. Thanks."

"Not at all. Eat slowly to avoid choking."

Byeon Gil-nam, scanning Lee Chang-jin up and down, remarked in admiration.

"Up close, you've grown up well. I hear you're doing well as a businessman in Seoul. Congratulations."

"It's just the beginning. Thank you for your support."

"Enough with the humility. Do you have something to say to me?"

Sensing something, Byeon Gil-nam prompted Lee Chang-jin to get to the point.

"Well, actually, I’m planning to expand the road in front of the village. I need some of your land for that."

Byeon Gil-nam, who had been chewing meat, showed a hint of excitement.

"If you pay me fairly, I can sell it. How much are you thinking? I can't sell at a loss."

"I found out the market price is 500 won per pyeong. I heard you said you’d sell at three times the market price last time? I’ll pay the price you asked for."

Byeon Gil-nam's eyes widened at Lee Chang-jin's proposal.

He didn't expect such a straightforward offer.

But that was short-lived as greed crept in, and Byeon Gil-nam shook his head.

"That's not enough. Times have changed since then. 3,000 won per pyeong is more appropriate now. Land prices have gone up."

Lee Chang-jin frowned slightly.

"3,000 won? That's a bit much. Even decent areas in Seoul don't cost that much."

"Take it or leave it. It's not like I’m desperate."

Despite the ongoing haggling, Byeon Gil-nam remained firm.

Uncle Dong-sik, who had been listening in, couldn't hold back any longer and stood up.

"Hey, come on. Who doesn't have greed? He’s offering three times the market price. Isn't that enough? Why be so greedy? Just take the fair price."

Annoyed, Byeon Gil-nam retorted.

"Why do you care if I want to get a fair price for my land? Just stay out of it."

"What? Are you talking to an elder like that?"

"Are you buying the land? Why do you keep interfering? Mind your own business..."

"This isn't just your problem. It's the village's problem. Expanding the road benefits everyone. Why can't I say anything? Aren't you a member of the village? We should make concessions and live harmoniously. Why be so stingy..."

"Concessions? Do you think I'm running a charity? Stop giving your unsolicited advice and move along."

Furious, Uncle Dong-sik grabbed the plate of meat Byeon Gil-nam was eating from.

"What the... If you're going to talk like that, don't eat the meat."

"Is this your meat? Why are you taking it? How petty."

"This pig was slaughtered by me. Why? I have a share! Why can't I brag about it when you're eating for free?"

As the argument escalated, people began to murmur.

Most of the villagers sided with Uncle Dong-sik.

Unable to watch any longer, Father stepped in to calm things down.

"Why fight over food? It's a festive day... Let's keep it nice. Dong-sik, stop it. What is this behavior in front of food?"

"But his attitude is so disrespectful, brother. He's here eating for free and talks like that."

"Enough! Stop it! You're so petty."

Byeon Gil-nam, who had stood up angrily, stormed out of the yard.

"Unbelievable, boasting over food. Disgusting."

Byeon Gil-nam's family, who had been eating with him, also stood up in confusion.

Byeon Gil-nam's young wife bowed her head apologetically.

"I'm sorry, Changjin's father. My husband is still immature. Truly sorry."

"It's alright. Go after him. You must be having a hard time."

"Oh dear... He's sulking. Ki-tae's dad, go with them!"

Byeon Gil-nam's family members hurriedly followed after him.

Still fuming, Uncle Dong-sik muttered under his breath.

"As if he doesn’t eat. He ate the most..."

Still seething, Uncle Dong-sik snorted, and Father clicked his tongue.

"Why did you take the food? Don't embarrass him like that. Are you a child? You should have calmed him down, not stirred the pot."

Mother, who had been standing nearby, also chimed in quietly.

"He's right. You went too far this time, brother-in-law."

"But sister-in-law, did you see his attitude? He’s so annoying."

"Even so. You're a fifty-year-old man. Should you act like a child with someone much younger? Even if Gil-nam is rough around the edges, you should handle him gently."

"Are you a saint? This is not the first time he’s acted like this. Can't you see his behavior? He’s bitter because he couldn't become the village chief. That rascal needs a good beating."

"Yes. Uncle Dong-sik is right!"

The villagers sided with Uncle Dong-sik, and Father lost his temper.

"Enough with the nonsense... Just eat your meat!"

Father stuffed a mouthful of ssam into his mouth.

Feeling awkward, Uncle Dong-sik swallowed his meat and muttered, embarrassed.

"Changjin, I'm sorry. Did I say something unnecessary?"

"It's alright. I'm okay. If we can't agree, there's nothing we can do."

Though he said that, Lee Chang-jin couldn't help but feel uneasy. He had hoped to gently convince Byeon Gil-nam to sell the land, but now that he had left in a huff, it would be difficult to persuade him for a while.

Just then, the sound of rain started, turning into a heavy downpour. Father, frowning at the sky, looked up with a resentful expression.

"Again? Why rain at this time?"

"The sky is telling us to stop. Everyone, are you done eating? Let's pack up before we get soaked."

People hurriedly moved the chairs and grill to the village warehouse.

Soon, the rain started pouring heavily.

Under the dark clouds, the heavy rain began to fall.

Clicking his tongue, the village chief murmured.

"Today is ruined. Let's talk about the road later and get some sleep."

Having been outside all day, Lee Chang-jin was very tired.

The family lay down early, using the sound of rain as a lullaby.

After some time, the lights suddenly turned on, and a frantic shout was heard.

"Father. Something terrible has happened! Wake up quickly."

The family, startled by Chang-sik’s rain-soaked shout, slowly opened their eyes.

Half-asleep, Lee Chang-jin also woke up to the commotion.

Rubbing his eyes, Father asked.

"What’s happening at this hour?"

"It's serious, Father, the levee has collapsed."

"What? What nonsense are you spouting?"

"It's true, Father. I went out to relieve myself and saw that the fields are flooded. It's chaos."

"What!"

Father, now fully awake, changed into his work clothes and grabbed a raincoat.

Lee Chang-jin also hurriedly got ready.

"I'll go with you, Father."

"No, if you go out in this rain, you'll catch a cold. You're tired, so get some more sleep."

"I'm part of the family too. I should help if needed."

When they arrived at the site, the situation was worse than expected. The fields around the levee were more than half flooded, and the crops ready for harvest were toppled over.

"What is this? We haven't even harvested yet. What do we do!" 

Father, stomping his feet, was joined by a grim-faced Chang-sik.

Lee Chang-jin, who arrived with them, also realized the severity of the situation.

Without delay, Lee Chang-jin returned home and grabbed his car keys.

"Where are you going, brother?"

"We need to drain the water. I'm going to the community center to borrow a water pump."

Lee Chang-jin quickly brought the water pump and started draining the water. Meanwhile, Chang-sik, with a rope tied around him, joined the villagers in the fields to help.

"Everyone, let's give it our all! Heave-ho, heave-ho!"

Moving the rope to create a flow in the water helps supply oxygen and reduces the damage by preventing mud deposits from sticking between the leaves.

Hearing the news, the village chief also came out in his pajamas.

Seeing the collapsed levee, the village chief's jaw dropped.

"What kind of disaster is this?"

"As you can see, the levee has collapsed. I’ll handle the repairs here, so please go to the county office and request emergency pest control. I’ll cover the cost of the pest control chemicals, so get them on credit and bring them quickly."

"Got it. I’ll contact them right away."

Fortunately, the rain started to subside by dawn. The people soaked by the rain diverted the water and were just about to catch their breath when Byeon Gil-nam, who had just heard the news, came running. His face was pale with anxiety.

"Huff, huff, everyone is here. Is it almost done here? Please help us too."

Having gone to town, Byeon Gil-nam returned only after hearing about the levee collapse.

But the villagers, busy with flood recovery, coldly rejected Byeon Gil-nam’s request.

"Well... We’re short on hands here too. I'm sorry, but we’ll help your side later."

"Sorry, we’re swamped right now... It’s impossible at the moment."

The villagers, who had long harbored resentments, were not easily swayed.

For Byeon Gil-nam, it was a desperate situation.

With the fields submerged, a delay would mean the entire year's harvest could be ruined. Desperate, Byeon Gil-nam sought help from Lee Chang-jin.

"Then at least lend me the water pump."

"Sorry, we’re using it right now. It's borrowed from the community center, so please wait a bit."

"Are you serious? Mr. Lee? Are you doing this because of the road? I didn't expect this from you."

Byeon Gil-nam's unreasonable behavior made Lee Chang-jin awkwardly smile.

But no one responded to Byeon Gil-nam’s repeated pleas.

Annoyed, Uncle Dong-sik muttered loudly for everyone to hear.

"He knows full well, yet why is he acting like this? Serves him right."

"Yeah. Byeon, how can you show your face here? If you had any conscience, you wouldn't come here."

Surprised by the villagers' cold reactions, Byeon Gil-nam was momentarily taken aback.

He didn't expect this level of rejection.

But Byeon Gil-nam remained true to himself.

Angrily, Byeon Gil-nam shouted.

"You cheapskates... Do you think I'll sell my land now? Never!"

At Byeon Gil-nam's threat, Uncle Dong-sik responded incredulously.

"Listen to him talk. Look at those eyes. I should twist your mouth."

"Shut up. Don’t run your mouth before I beat you."

"What did you say? You dare talk to me like that, Gil-nam? Where's your respect?"

"Yeah! Don't just talk, let’s fight. Uncle Dong-sik, let's settle this without any ranks. Come on!"

"What? You think I'll back down? Fine, let's fight!"

Furious at the brazen challenge, Uncle Dong-sik raised his fist.

The village men, equally enraged, threw down their shovels and took off their shirts.

In the tense moment, a thunderous voice rang out from somewhere.

"You rascals. What’s this behavior? Stop it right now!"

Everyone turned around to see an old woman leaning on a cane, glaring at them.
