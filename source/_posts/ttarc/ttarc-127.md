## Episode 127: Business on the Yacht

Lee Chang-jin surveyed the yacht and exclaimed in admiration.

"Wow, this is impressive. When did you acquire something like this?"

"Oh, this? It was built by a craftsman named Holloway in Fort Lauderdale. He's a renowned yacht builder in that industry. Actually, I didn't order it myself. A guy who used to play pachinko in Japan gave it to me as a gift. It was supposed to go to auction, but I received it as a substitute."

Using such a luxurious yacht as collateral was indeed a class apart.

As they approached, several people who appeared to be sailors were untying the ropes attached to the dock.

The captain, who had a striking head of gray hair, recognized Jin Tae-chun and bowed respectfully.

"Chairman, you're here?"

Jin Tae-chun, who seemed friendly with the captain, patted him on the shoulder and spoke.

"Hey, Dong-chil. Long time no see. Is the boat ready?"

"Yes, it's been fully rebuilt."

"Good job. You must have had a lot of work. Didn't Chairman Nam's stingy son bother you? He borrows it too often even though he could buy one himself."

"Haha, what are you saying? It's an honor for us when the chairmen visit. We owe our livelihood to you gentlemen."

"Haha, you speak well. So, how's the water today?"

"Calm. Luckily, the weather is perfect today."

"It's a great time to set sail."

"Indeed. By the way, who is the person next to you?"

Jin Tae-chun laughed heartily at the captain's inquisitive look at Lee Chang-jin.

"This is my future son-in-law. He’s been in the news a few times. You know the trendy beer these days? He’s the owner."

The captain, finally recognizing him, extended his hand for a handshake.

"Oh, the pub? Of course, I know. We had our year-end party there. You're impressive, young man."

"Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Chang-jin."

"And likewise."

Feeling proud of the captain's attitude, Jin Tae-chun put his arm around Lee Chang-jin and pulled him along.

"Since we have company today, please take good care of us. How about a tour of the inside of the yacht, son-in-law? Show him around."

"Yes, of course. Please, come inside."

The interior of the yacht was pure 'luxury.' It was equipped with a bathroom where one could bathe, a kitchen, a refrigerator, a TV, and more. The bedroom's bed was designed to rotate, allowing a view of the sea through the window.

Despite weighing over 90 tons, the yacht's refined details, even in the smallest hatches, spoke volumes about the owner's level of sophistication.

After finishing the tour, Lee Chang-jin returned to the deck and noticed expensive graphite fishing rods neatly lined up in one corner.

The captain, who had brought the gear with some effort, placed an icebox next to the fishing rods.

"Is everything ready?"

"Yes!"

"Then, let's set off!"

As the captain raised the anchor, the boat sounded its horn and set sail. Three large fishing boats surrounded the yacht in a triangular formation, creating a magnificent sight.

The yacht, slicing through the sea at the tip of the triangle formation, looked truly majestic.

Lee Chang-jin, standing on the deck, deeply inhaled the sea breeze coming from the opposite direction.

The refreshing sea breeze tickled his nose.

With the clear weather and not a cloud in the sky, Lee Chang-jin felt a sense of liberation.

Jin Tae-chun, wearing sunglasses, also appeared relaxed for the first time in a while.

The yacht, heading towards the horizon, eventually stopped at a point where rocky reefs were visible.

The captain checked the compass and reported to Jin Tae-chun.

"We're here, Chairman."

The group had arrived at Sobyeonghaedo, commonly known as 'Sonda.'

This place, famous in the region, was not only a scenic spot but also a well-known fishing area for black porgy, sea bass, and rockfish, known for its abundant catches all year round.

After dropping the anchor, the sailors who had boarded the yacht took out the gear from the icebox they had prepared.

The box contained reels, pre-tied rigs, and sinkers, among other items.

Jin Tae-chun, holding a fishing rod, expertly attached the bait to the hook.

Lee Chang-jin, without hesitation, also attached the bait to his hook. Jin Tae-chun's eyes gleamed as he watched.

"You seem quite experienced. Do you know how to fish?"

"A little."

"A little? What do you mean by that?"

"I did some freshwater fishing in streams when I was young. I also fished for mountain trout occasionally in college. But this is my first time sea fishing."

In his previous life, he had been too busy with business to enjoy fishing.

Pleased by this, Jin Tae-chun smiled and said,

"Then this must be your first time casting long-distance. Shall I teach you?"

"I would appreciate that. I'll listen carefully."

Lee Chang-jin saw no reason to refuse. Jin Tae-chun, holding the fishing line, kindly explained.

"In long-distance casting, the success depends on the casting distance. The farther you cast, the better. But don't be too greedy. If you strain too much, the rod might break, or the main line could snap. Even though it's made of graphite, it's more fragile than you think. Now, watch how I do it."

After checking the fishing line, Jin Tae-chun cast the line into the sea as a demonstration. The line flew like a whip and disappeared into the water with a gurgling sound.

Watching closely, Lee Chang-jin prepared to cast his own line.

Confirming that the rig was aligned, Lee Chang-jin used the rod's elasticity to cast the line into the water.

Whoosh~!

The rig flew at a 45-degree angle and hit the water with force.

The line, flying with a splash, took a few seconds to sink. As the line slackened on the surface, Jin Tae-chun, gauging the distance, clapped in approval.

"I must stay alert. Most men can cast around 70 meters at most, but you nearly reached 100 meters. You have quite the strength."

"Thank you. I was a pitcher on the university baseball team. My shoulder is quite reliable."

Skillfully reeling in, Lee Chang-jin fixed the line to one side and evenly spread ground bait mixed with fresh worms. This was to attract fish by scattering food.

With preparations done, it was now a waiting game.

Watching the rod tip for a while, Jin Tae-chun, seemingly bored, initiated a conversation.

"By the way, how are things in the Middle East these days? You seem to be well-informed, having been there yourself."

Lee Chang-jin, focused on his line, responded.

"It's quite chaotic. The Pahlavi dynasty in Iran won't last much longer. It could collapse by the end of this month."

"Is it that serious?"

"Yes. The Shah is in poor health and unable to govern. A revolution will likely happen soon. Since the majority of the population is Shia, it's probable that the Shia religious leader, Khomeini, will take power."

The current situation in Iran was utter chaos. Diagnosed with cancer four years ago, Shah Pahlavi II's condition worsened earlier this year, leading to the cancellation of all overseas trips.

Cancer treatment caused the Shah depression and impaired his thinking, escalating the already tumultuous political situation to uncontrollable levels.

Anti-monarchy protests, frequent since early '78, worsened following the Rex Cinema arson in Abadan in August.

"But wouldn't the U.S. intervene if it gets that bad? Isn't Khomeini an Islamic fundamentalist? The U.S. has a phobia of anything Islamic and wouldn't just stand by as a pro-American regime collapses."

Khomeini, the current Shia religious leader, was in exile in Paris.

"Well, the Carter administration seems overly optimistic about the situation. Or they might think it's too late to intervene. The problem is Khomeini. He's an anti-American who isn't afraid of the U.S. If the U.S. tries to intervene politically, Khomeini might sever diplomatic ties to maintain his revolutionary regime, even going as far as halting all oil exports."

"Would Khomeini, as fanatical as he is, really do something that foolish?"

"It's not just anti-American sentiment. A new regime needs to assert itself to gain recognition from neighboring countries. Striking at the West while making money would be ideal. If Khomeini bans oil exports, OPEC would likely follow suit with collective action."

Indeed, despite the Camp David Accords signed by Sadat of Egypt and Begin of Israel under President Carter's leadership, the agreement was merely a reconciliation between Egypt and Israel.

Egypt received $2 billion annually in return for ceasing involvement in the Gaza Strip after reclaiming the Sinai Peninsula, but other Arab nations did not recognize the agreement.

"Weaponizing oil, huh? Even if not, continued political instability in Iran would hinder oil exports, potentially leading to a second oil shock. This will certainly stir up the political scene. Given your insights, have you already made preparations?"

"Roughly. I've stockpiled petroleum products and made some futures investments. I also bought gold."

"Gold, huh? Haha, I should do the same. Thanks for the valuable information. I'll take it into account."

"How's the establishment of the financial company coming along?"

Watching the rod tip, Jin Tae-chun replied,

"I've greased some palms in the political sphere, but timing is crucial. The bill's passage is still far off. Big corporations seem to be obstructing it, making slow progress. Moreover, there's no trustworthy candidate to run it."

"Aren't you considering taking the lead yourself? If you take charge, any minor issues would quickly be resolved."

"Haha, why would I bother with such unnecessary exposure? Besides, for whom? If I become well-known, I won't be able to lend money and act tough. I don't want to beg politicians at my age."

"Then who do you plan to put in charge?"

"How about you taking the position? You'd be perfect as the CEO of a financial company."

"Me? What about Seon-ah?"

"Seon-ah, being a woman, faces many limitations. She might have handled smaller sums, but never something this large. Plus, societal perceptions in Korea are still quite backward."

Lee Chang-jin shook his head in disagreement.

"That can be overcome by proving her capabilities. Isn't Seon-ah more competent than most men? There might be initial controversy, but it will subside once she demonstrates her skills."

"True, but we can't take such risks from the start. Investors are more conservative than you think. Moreover, being a CEO isn't for everyone. One needs experience, like you, who has faced various challenges. Who would entrust money otherwise?"

"Thank you for the compliment. However, I believe Seon-ah should be given the opportunity. Blood doesn't lie, and she'll surely excel."

"Hey, son-in-law, don't keep dodging. You're also my son. Do you think I'd ask you to be a puppet CEO? Don't worry. I've allocated a generous share for you."

"Oh, please don't. It makes me uncomfortable."

"I'm not joking, son-in-law. Even within the family, I handle calculations meticulously. To attract a competent executive, stock options are a must. I'm serious."

"Understood, Father. Please discuss it when things move forward. It's too early to bring it up now."

"Haha, I've already made up my mind. Just know that."

In the midst of their conversation, a signal came from the fishing line. The rod, which had been swaying sideways, now bobbed up and down. It was time to strike.

"It's here!"

Patience was needed to ensure the bait hooked properly. Lee Chang-jin pulled the rod back and then forward, lifting it. He felt resistance from the fish.

The Japanese carbon reel rod dipped vertically before stiffening with tension. Lee Chang-jin engaged in a tug-of-war with the fish.

He alternated between loosening and tightening the taut line, reeling it in. Shortly after, a large fish splashed to the surface.

"A big catch!"

The first fish caught was a hefty black porgy.

The black porgy, flapping vigorously, measured a whopping 50 cm from head to tail.

True to its winter prime, the black porgy had a high body and broad frame, making the catch exhilarating.

As the net grew heavier, the day gradually waned, and it was time for the ebb tide.

"It looks like it's time to head back."

"Great. Let's head to a nearby villa. I have a place I'd like to show you."

The boat sliced through the water once more, heading towards the open sea.

As the sun began to set, the group arrived at an island resembling a turtle.
