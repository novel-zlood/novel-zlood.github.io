## Episode 8: Oil Shock

Lee Chang-jin, surprised to see Jin Seon-ah waiting, asked in amazement.

"Hey, Assistant Jin, when did you follow me all the way here?"

"What do you mean? I took a taxi and followed you. More importantly, how's the patient? Was everything resolved without any issues?"

"Yes, fortunately, there's no threat to his life. The guardian has arrived as well, so there shouldn't be any more problems."

Only then did Jin Seon-ah sigh in relief, clutching her chest.

"That's a relief. Having someone collapse right in front of me was shocking. But more importantly, where did you learn CPR?"

Lee Chang-jin chuckled and replied evasively.

"At the Rotary Flipper Fry Center."

"Pardon?"

Seeing her puzzled expression, Lee Chang-jin clarified.

"I learned it in the military. I served as an ROTC."

"Oh, I see. Anyway, that's really impressive. I've never seen anything like that before."

Jin Seon-ah's tone was full of admiration.

Perhaps the earlier incident left an impression on her. Her voice seemed oddly softer now.

"By the way, the time right now..."

Lee Chang-jin hastily checked his wristwatch.

It hadn't taken as long as he thought; they had about an hour to spare.

"Good. Shall we go get some dessert? I feel like something sweet after a bit of exercise."

"Sounds good. Just follow me. It's actually near this hospital."

The place Jin Seon-ah led Lee Chang-jin to was a small bakery.

The Western-style interior clashed with the 1970s atmosphere.

A sign written in elegant cursive caught their eyes: Montmartre.

As they opened the front door, the sweet aroma of freshly baked bread filled their senses.

The smell was so appetizing that Lee Chang-jin took a deep breath.

"Pick whatever you want to eat first. I'll be chatting for a bit."

"Alright."

With tongs in hand, Lee Chang-jin went to choose some desserts.

A woman wearing a baker's hat was waiting at the counter.

She greeted Jin Seon-ah warmly.

"Oh, Seon-ah, you're here again?"

"Yeah, I've been doing well as always. How's the business, Young-mi?"

"Of course, it's doing great. Didn't you know? I just opened a second branch near Jongno."

"Oh, congratulations! It seems like you're really getting on track now."

"This is just the beginning. By the way, you've gotten prettier. What are you using on your skin?"

"It's natural. No cream can make it like this."

"Hmph, you're something else. But who’s that you're with? A boyfriend?"

"No, he's my client."

To avoid the women's chatter, Lee Chang-jin moved towards the back.

The woman, after sneaking a glance at Lee Chang-jin's face, whispered softly.

"Hoo, he looks decent. Why is he involved with private loans? But he's kind of handsome. What's his job?"

"Ah, he's an engineer. He works at Mannheim."

Her eyes sparkled with interest at those words.

"Oh, an intellectual guy, totally my type. If he ever becomes a debtor, will you hand him over to me? I'll give you free desserts for life."

Jin Seon-ah's expression turned serious as she responded.

"Hey, cut the nonsense. Just go and do your work."

"Hmph, stingy. Can't even introduce a guy to a friend. You’re so popular anyway. I hope you get hemorrhoids or something. Constipated girl."

"What? You, stop right there!"

"Hmph, meh. Frustrated, aren't you?"

Sticking her tongue out at the glaring Jin Seon-ah, the woman quickly fled to the back of the store.

Meanwhile, Lee Chang-jin, who had finished picking out desserts, approached Jin Seon-ah.

Smiling broadly, Lee Chang-jin said.

"Is your conversation over?"

"Hmph, you heard everything, didn't you? Pretending not to know..."

"Haha, I couldn't find a chance to butt in. By the way, you seem pretty close to that friend of yours."

"Oh, she's the owner here. We've known each other since middle school. She studied pastry in France. Her desserts are top-notch, although her personality is a bit off..."

"True, the decorations are so impressive that it's almost a shame to eat them. I've picked mine."

Jin Seon-ah sighed at the sight of the modestly filled plate.

"Is this all you picked? How is this enough for anyone?"

"Haha, sorry. Did I pick too little?"

"Of course. Give me the tongs."

With tongs in hand, she surveyed the store.

She filled the plate with soft strawberry pudding, eclairs topped with chocolate, layered mille-feuille, soft-looking cheesecake, and colorful macarons.

By the time she finished picking, the plate was piled high.

Seeing the huge amount, Lee Chang-jin mumbled, overwhelmed.

"Can we really eat all this?"

"Of course. Do you only have a stomach for meals? There's always room for dessert."

As Lee Chang-jin sat down and took a bite of caramel-topped pudding, the woman from earlier brought over a warm cup of coffee.

"This is on the house, handsome man."

"Oh. Thank you, ma'am."

At her wink, Jin Seon-ah sulked and asked.

"Hey, what about mine?"

"Here, you have grape juice instead of caffeine. It's freshly squeezed and healthy."

"Hmph, brat. At least you know the basics."

Lee Chang-jin smiled faintly at her slightly softened tone.

He took a spoonful of the fluffy pudding with the coffee.

The creamy and rich coffee aroma combined with the soft pudding made him exclaim in delight.

"Wow, this is amazing! It melts in your mouth."

"Right? Try this too. It has strawberry jam inside, and the texture is perfect."

Jin Seon-ah's face lit up with happiness as she stuffed her mouth with something sweet.

Seeing her like a hamster made Lee Chang-jin feel good as well.

The massive amount of dessert was more than half gone in the blink of an eye.

Lee Chang-jin, enjoying a brief moment of relaxation, finally spoke.

"Now that we're full, let's get to the point. You said you came to check earlier. What's the real reason?"

Drinking grape juice through a straw, Jin Seon-ah replied softly.

"Don't be nervous. I just came for debtor management. I heard you bought kerosene in bulk, but I haven't heard that you've started selling it yet. When do you plan to start the business?"

"I'm still waiting for the right time. Winter is still far off."

"Hmm, will you be able to pay the interest on time, Chang-jin? I heard you invested everything in kerosene."

Worry was evident in Jin Seon-ah's eyes. Lee Chang-jin smiled confidently.

"Haha, don't worry. Are you concerned about me?"

"Yes. Honestly, many of our uncles are quite rough..."

Her honest words made Lee Chang-jin smile subtly.

"Thank you for your concern. But it feels strange, like a cat worrying about a mouse."

Jin Seon-ah laughed along with Lee Chang-jin's jest.

"I won't deny that. Anyway, you seem confident, so you must have a way to make a profit, right?"

"Don't worry. You'll see soon enough."

Why does she feel strangely reassured despite having no solid evidence?

With her chin resting on her hand, Jin Seon-ah looked at Lee Chang-jin.

"You're really unique, Chang-jin."

"What do you mean? I may not seem like it, but I'm a very ordinary man."

"It's just that, when a young woman like me says she's in the private loan business, nine out of ten people look at me with prejudice. They either secretly despise or feel burdened by it. But you're neither."

"Haha. Is there any particular reason for that? Let's just say there's no bias."

Not displeased by Lee Chang-jin's words, Jin Seon-ah snickered.

"Huh, are you trying to flirt with me? I admit you're attractive, but I'll have to decline respectfully. It's my principle not to get personally involved with debtors..."

"Huh, so there's a chance? That's an honor. I guess I'll have to pay off my debt first."

At Lee Chang-jin's subtle response, she avoided a direct answer.

"We'll talk about that when the time comes. You seem to have lost quite a bit of weight since the last time I saw you... Is that right?"

"Yes, a bit. But how did you notice?"

In fact, Lee Chang-jin had been taking on private tutoring jobs in addition to preparing for exams to gather startup funds.

It was a precaution in case of any unexpected situation.

Working non-stop naturally took a toll on his body.

Noticing his complexion, she responded with concern.

"I thought so. Don't overdo it."

"Haha, it's fine. It's just regular overwork. I'll get used to it soon."

Even with Lee Chang-jin's joke, she couldn't hide her concern.

"It's not just a bit. Come here, let me check your forehead."

"Pardon?"

"Let me check if you have a fever. Come closer."

She suddenly extended her small hand forward.

The soft touch made Lee Chang-jin flinch for a moment.

"Hmm, no fever... What's the problem then?"

As she tilted her head, her neckline was exposed.

Not knowing where to look, Lee Chang-jin awkwardly cleared his throat.

"Ahem, uh, Assistant Jin."

"Yes?"

"While I appreciate your concern, it's a bit embarrassing for me."

"Oh, oh my! I'm sorry."

Realizing she had gotten too close to Lee Chang-jin, Jin Seon-ah quickly backed away, startled.

"I'm sorry, Chang-jin..."

"It's fine. But for a creditor to worry about a debtor's health... Do you treat all your debtors like this?"

Jin Seon-ah's ears turned red, and her cheeks blushed.

"Lee Chang-jin, you're an important client. Fifteen hundred is not a trivial amount. And as you said, your body is collateral. So you can't get sick without my permission."

Fanning herself in embarrassment, Jin Seon-ah looked cute, making Lee Chang-jin smile.

"Don't worry. I'm very healthy. Even my kidney function is perfectly fine."

"Hmm. Even as a joke, don't say things like that. People might think I'm out to harvest organs."

Jin Seon-ah muttered in a barely audible voice.

After poking at the whipped cream with her fork, she checked her watch and grabbed her bag.

"What, are you leaving already?"

"Yes. I have another appointment. You should get back to the company as well."

The dessert plates were already empty.

As Lee Chang-jin cleared the plates, he noticed something written in whipped cream.

It said "idiot" carved with a fork.

'Was she doing this earlier?'

He couldn't help but smile at the cute gesture.

As he left the bakery, Lee Chang-jin waved and raised his voice.

"Seon-ah, see you next time!"

At the sudden familiarity, Jin Seon-ah paused for a moment.

Hiding her expression, she continued walking.

Not far away, a sleek Cadillac waited.

As Jin Seon-ah approached the car, the chauffeur quickly opened the back door.

"Shall we depart?"

"No, not yet. Just a moment."

Inside the tinted car, Jin Seon-ah observed outside.

Seeing Lee Chang-jin disappear behind a building with his coffee, she leaned back in her seat.

"Now we can go, Driver Kim."

"Yes, ma'am."

Nothing obstructed the vehicle's path.

In the 1970s, imported cars were symbols of power and wealth.

Foreign cars in the 1970s cost several times more than an average house in Seoul, with a 255% tax, making them inaccessible to the average person.

The car smoothly passed through the streets, arriving in front of Jangchung Gymnasium.

The grand scenery between the glittering sunlight and the mountain was imposing.

Jangchung-dong was known for its affluent residents in the 1970s.

The vehicle stopped in front of a three-story Western-style house.

Jin Seon-ah gracefully exited and entered the mansion.

Inside, bodyguards were meticulously tending to the garden.

The sight of burly men wielding scissors as gardeners was quite amusing.

Upon noticing Jin Seon-ah, the bodyguards stood at attention and greeted her in unison.

"Have you returned, miss?"

"Did you have a good trip?"

"Yes, thank you. Keep up the good work."

After a perfunctory greeting, Jin Seon-ah leisurely entered the house.

A plump housekeeper in her early thirties greeted her warmly.

"You're home, miss? You're a bit later than usual today."

"Yes, I met with a debtor today."

"A debtor? What kind of person could it be..."

The housekeeper asked, surprised. This was a rare occurrence.

"He's a bit unique. Has manners too."

"A man? If you took interest, he must be a good person..."

Jin Seon-ah muttered, not displeased, at the housekeeper's curious question.

"Hmph, I don't know. His face is decent, but we'll see."

The memories from earlier lingered in her mind, feeling oddly strange.

Shaking her head as if to erase the residual images, she spoke.

"I'm tired today. I need to rest early. Prepare some warm water for a bath."

"Yes, miss. Go ahead. I'll get the water ready."

After a refreshing bath, Jin Seon-ah, wearing a bathrobe, sat on the sofa.

A cold yogurt was prepared on the table beside her.

Sipping the yogurt from a glass, she hummed a tune and turned on the TV.

The news was on, covering political issues. After a while, bored, Jin Seon-ah yawned.

"Wow, boring. Same old stories. Is there nothing fresh?"

Muttering to herself, she changed the channel to a popular daily drama.

Engrossed in the drama, the screen suddenly changed, and a news anchor appeared abruptly.

"Breaking news! A war has just erupted in the Middle East. Early yesterday morning, Egypt and Syria joined forces to invade Israel. The armies are reportedly advancing towards the capital!"

War? No way?

The TV showed tanks and soldiers with guns rushing out.

The location was the Sinai Peninsula.

So that means?

Jin Seon-ah's eyes widened.
