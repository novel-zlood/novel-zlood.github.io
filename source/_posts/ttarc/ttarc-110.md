## Episode 110: The Green Revolution

In June 1978, Lee Chang-jin opened the second farm. The first farm was about 40 km northwest of Damam City, while the second farm was located about 38 km toward Riyadh.

As they turned off the highway onto the entrance of the second farm, the entire desert, which was tinged with red, transformed into a vivid green color. The lands partitioned in rectangular shapes over the endless countryside. The eyes, tired from the desert sand, felt refreshed.

Today was the day when Chief Won from Korea was visiting. Along with him were the practical investigation team from each department, Ambassador Kim Ye-hoon, and Choi Kyung-tae, the Minister of Energy Resources, officially visiting the farm.

"Have you arrived, Chief?"

"It's been a while. President Lee, has it been two years?"

"Has it already been that long? It feels like just yesterday to me, but you haven't changed at all, Chief."

"People are like that. No need for such flattery. But your face has become so tanned and thin. It seems you've had a tough time abroad."

"It was a voluntary endeavor. I'm just grateful for the opportunity."

"Look at this guy. What help did I give you? Don't say things that might cause misunderstandings. But the farm is much larger than I initially heard. How big is it?"

"Yes, it's a total of 400,000 pyeong (approximately 1.32 million square meters). The recently expanded part accounts for about half of it."

In just six months, Lee Chang-jin's plantation farm had grown enormously. The circular fields centered around central sprinklers were so densely arranged that they could be distinguished from the air by airplanes.

One notable feature was the greenhouse farm, where the entire pipe system moved automatically, spraying water. The sight of dozens of straight pipes and numerous nozzles attached to large sprinklers moving and spraying water was impressive. The Minister of Agriculture, seeing this, showed a pleased expression.

"Isn't this a center pivot system?"

"Yes, that's correct. We draw water from the aquifer through pipes and supply it here."

In the greenhouse, popular vegetables among the Saudi people were growing abundantly.

Chief Won, out of curiosity, touched the nozzle spraying water and tasted the water slightly.

"It's very cold and fresh. The water looks clean....... Did you process the limestone?"

"There was no need for that. The water from the aquifer is already filtered, so it's clean enough to drink directly."

Seeing various kinds of vegetables and plants, including cabbages and radishes, growing in the reclaimed farm, Chief Won couldn't hide his admiration. The Minister of Agriculture, also curious, asked questions repeatedly.

"Oh, you grow tomatoes too. The desert has acidic soil, making it hard for vegetables to grow. How did you solve the pH problem?"

"We spread lime and soil neutralizers airlifted from Korea at 10 kg per pyeong (approximately 32.4 kg per square meter) across the entire area. It took about two months to improve the soil."

"10 kg per pyeong, that's really impressive. The facility costs must not have been easy. What if it had failed?"

"Haha, without challenges, there are no gains. I had a strong feeling it would work out. You could call it a merchant's intuition."

Indeed, each well cost at least 200,000 riyals, and establishing the center pivot system cost 300,000 riyals each. However, the profits from selling vegetables more than covered these expenses.

Chief Won, after touring the farm, spoke sincerely.

"For a private Korean company to pioneer a large-scale plantation farm in the desert by integrating advanced agricultural technologies...... I never imagined I'd see something like this. I hope other Korean businessmen can learn from this. Isn't this true national prestige?"

"Absolutely. It's truly an admirable feat."

In response to the aides' echoing praises, Lee Chang-jin modestly redirected the credit.

"It's nothing special. We just integrated some recently introduced farming methods. Actually, Director Yang here has been the most hardworking."

At this, the Minister of Agriculture chimed in.

"Haha, I understand the operational staff's hard work, but your foresight is even more impressive. Investing so boldly in something so uncertain—how did you come up with such an idea? Even people who have lived on this land for hundreds of years couldn't think of it."

"Haha, there's a Korean proverb: 'It's dark under the lamp.' What seems obvious to locals might look different to outsiders."

"That's true. I heard you're from a farming background as well?"

"Yes, that's correct. I grew up in a rural area in Iksan, Jeollabuk-do."

"Indeed, what you see and learn as a child stays with you. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the future direction of Korean agriculture. Could you share a few words?"

Everyone's eyes sparkled with interest at Chief Won's question, all eager to hear what Lee Chang-jin had to say. Feeling a bit pressured, Lee Chang-jin politely declined.

"I'm not sure if I'm qualified to comment on policies."

"Haha, I think you've already proven your qualifications. After all, you're the one who brought about a green revolution in this desert. I'd appreciate even a small piece of your wisdom."

The government was also aware of the crisis concerning food security. They had been implementing policies to expand arable land and invest in facilities by providing subsidies and low-interest loans. However, seeing such a remarkable outcome after a period of stagnation was truly moving.

Reluctantly, Lee Chang-jin spoke.

"If you insist, I'll share a few words. First and foremost, rather than compensating farmers' income through subsidies and government assistance, we need to establish a proper competitive order to foster self-sufficiency among farmers.

Reducing the debt burden of rural residents is important, but the priority should be reducing labor costs through agricultural mechanization to solve the fundamental problem.

Moreover, improving the distribution structure of farms to minimize middlemen who exploit margins between consumers and suppliers is necessary. Simplifying the distribution process will naturally increase farmers' income."

"It's easier said than done. With limited budgets, do you think that's possible?"

"It depends on the government's determination. First, establishing an organization capable of implementing policies effectively is crucial. For example, setting up a Livestock Promotion Association to manage feed supply, livestock improvement, and promote livestock advancement would simplify the process of controlling supply and prices."

"What about other areas, like rice farming? As our diet becomes more Westernized, there's always an oversupply of rice. What are your thoughts on this?"

"We need to repeal the current high rice price policy and set a low limit on the purchase price of rice. Currently, most of the grain fund deficits are covered by long-term borrowing from the Bank of Korea, but this is all taxpayer money, isn't it?

Such policies inevitably lead to inflation and fiscal deficits. Moreover, we need to quickly shift policies to prepare for import liberalization. As the economy develops, we will face pressure to open up imports from developed countries sooner or later. Securing the self-sufficiency of farms before that happens is crucial."

"It sounds like you're asking us to run before we can walk. Changing the rice purchase policy—won't that cause a huge backlash from farmers?"

"There's no need to rush, but if it's an unsustainable policy, it's better to face it sooner rather than later. Food security is a long-term national strategy, isn't it? The government should allow market functions to operate as freely as possible while focusing its efforts on addressing market failures."

Knowing that the world was moving towards dismantling trade protectionism through the Uruguay Round following the graduation from the GATT system, Lee Chang-jin had a firm conviction about the direction of agriculture.

Ultimately, no policy could reverse the major trends, so it was the policy's role to adjust the pace and minimize the impact by considering the ripple effects.

Lee Chang-jin also discussed in detail the recent developments in desalination plant technology.

Finally, as it was time to part, Chief Won, who had been listening intently, extended his hand for a handshake.

"It was truly an enlightening time. I hope I haven't taken too much of a busy man's time."

"Not at all. Please feel free to visit anytime. The door is always open."

"Oh, I almost forgot before I go. Is there anything I can help you with?"

"Hmm, more than anything else, it would be helpful if the issuance of work visas for agricultural technicians with such experience and expertise could be simplified."

"Isn't that a given?"

"Yes, but our country's overseas employment regulations are too strict. We can only bring in skilled workers recruited by organizations like the Overseas Development Corporation or the International Skills Development Association, making it very difficult to find the right people for farming."

"Is that so? I'll take note of that. If you face any difficulties, feel free to contact me directly. I'll keep the line open."

After Chief Won left, Lee Chang-jin asked Goo Chang-dong.

"What are the additional tour plans?"

"This month ends with this visit. Next month, students from Riyadh National Agricultural University, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, and the Minister of Agriculture from Denmark are scheduled to visit."

"Then we can take a breather for now."

Lee Chang-jin felt exhausted from the hospitality. Sitting on the sofa to cool off, Goo Chang-dong brought in grilled shish kebabs.

"President, please have some food. You haven't eaten anything today."

"Oh, I was just getting hungry. Thank you, Manager Goo."

Goo Chang-dong also brought corn-made dishes with cheese, olives mixed with lemon, and hard-boiled eggs, which were common breakfast foods for the locals.

After finishing the meal, Goo Chang-dong brought a cold Americano to Lee Chang-jin.

"President, you are truly remarkable. To interact so casually with someone like Chief Won."

"Me too. My heart was pounding. It's my first time meeting such high-ranking individuals."

Yang Hyun-wook also admitted that his heart was racing. But seeing Lee Chang-jin skillfully host Chief Won earned him respect.

"Why are you all so surprised? Chief Won is just like us. Besides, Manager Goo, once you get promoted to an executive level, you'll be meeting such people frequently."

"Oh, don't say such things. I can't even imagine it. Just thinking about meeting such people makes my head spin and gives me hives."

The staff chuckled at Goo Chang-dong's joke. Then, Director Yang Hyun-wook, as if remembering something, spoke.

"By the way, President, many Saudi large landowners are eager to invest. How about establishing a separate corporation from Daese Farming and turning it into a joint venture? The Saudi Agricultural Office seems to think very positively about it."

Lee Chang-jin pondered for a moment at Director Yang Hyun-wook's suggestion.

"Hmm, a joint venture, it seems a bit early. Our main source of income is the dispatched laborers from Korea. We need to communicate with Koreans and handle the sales ourselves, so it's better for us to operate independently.

Moreover, partnering with unreliable individuals can lead to constant disputes and hinder business. Unless it's a condition of leasing the farm, joint ventures with locals carry significant risks. If we rapidly expand the farm through investments, we will inevitably have to outsource, and then the farming methods will be leaked in no time. There's no reason for us to create competitors."

"Ah, I was short-sighted."

"Haha, such enthusiasm is good. Always feel free to share any good ideas without hesitation."

Fortunately, the housing construction sector was on track, so there was some leeway.

After taking a brief rest, Lee Chang-jin contacted Manager Park Seung-hoon.
