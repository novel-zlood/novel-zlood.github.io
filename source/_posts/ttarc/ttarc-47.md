## Episode 47: Maljukgeori

Jin Seon-ah waved her hand upon spotting Lee Chang-jin.

“Over here! Changjin-ssi.”

“Wow, Jin Assistant Manager, why did you come so quickly?”

“I didn’t come quickly. I just finished work and had a cup of tea. Ah, that gentleman over there is Dong-geun, right?”

“Yes. Nice to meet you. I’m Lee Dong-geun.”

“I’m Jin Seon-ah. I work at Daese Group. Please have a seat. Changjin-ssi told me about you. First, Changjin-ssi, let's handle the urgent business. Shall we look at the prepared documents?”

As soon as Lee Chang-jin and Dong-geun sat down, Jin Seon-ah took out the documents and the land register.

Showing a few photos she had taken, Jin Seon-ah said, “This is the Maljukgeori flower complex we talked about last time. The total area is 12,200 pyeong, with about 6,200 pyeong available for use. The land is classified as forest and agricultural land and is designated as both an agricultural and conservation management area. Of the existing 6,000 pyeong, about 3,800 pyeong can be additionally designated for poultry farming, making around 10,000 pyeong usable in total. If we negotiate well with the existing flower farmers, there won’t be any issues with the renovation of the poultry farm.”

“How are the road conditions? Are there any sections that need new paving or construction?”

“You don’t need to worry about that. The area was originally used for the flower complex, so most of the access roads are already paved. Although some sections are unpaved, they are covered with gravel and are passable. No additional civil engineering work should be necessary.”

“So, we just need the residents’ agreement as discussed last time?”

“That’s right. Are you seriously considering purchasing?”

“Of course. How much do you think the land price should be?”

“The original market price is at least 400 million won, but since it has failed three public auctions, we’ll take just 30%. How about 120 million won?”

Lee Chang-jin, pretending to think it over, made a slightly doubtful expression.

“120 million won seems a bit expensive. I was thinking of around 100 million won at most… It's over the budget. Can you lower the price a bit?”

“Hmm. That’s difficult. Honestly, the land in Maljukgeori will only appreciate in value. It’s cheap now, but in 10 years, the price could increase tenfold.”

Indeed, over the past half-century, the land price in Maljukgeori has been rising rapidly. In the early 1960s, the price was around 300 won per pyeong. By 1968, with the construction of the southern end of the Hanam Bridge as the starting point of the Gyeongbu Expressway, the price skyrocketed to 6,000 won per pyeong. Although it briefly halted due to being designated a speculative restriction zone, it was a temporary phenomenon. By 1979, the price per pyeong in Gangnam had risen to 100,000 won. The myth of Gangnam Maljukgeori was not just a saying.

Knowing the circumstances well, Lee Chang-jin smiled and asked, “Then, I’m curious. Why don’t you keep the land for the long term?”

“Well, our side prefers cash business over land speculation. Assets with low liquidity may look good, but they’re useless in urgent times.”

In fact, from Jin Seon-ah’s perspective, Gangnam wasn’t an attractive investment destination. If she was going to invest in land, places like Tokyo or Shibuya would be much more advantageous.

Considering the domestic situation where development was used to raise political funds, a big player like Jin Tae-chun engaging in land speculation could be seen as a thorn in the side of the government.

Understanding her intentions, Lee Chang-jin nodded. “How about this, then? I’ll pay the price you want. Instead, would you take on the external auditor position for our newly established poultry cooperative?”

Surprised by the unexpected proposal, Jin Seon-ah asked, “An auditor?”

“Yes. To establish a cooperative, we need an external auditor. I think you’d be perfect for the role. What do you think?”

“Hmm... It’s a very sudden proposal...”

“With someone as capable and beautiful as you in the auditor position, it would be a great help for us. Don’t you think so, Dong-geun?”

Startled, Dong-geun quickly agreed. “Yes, absolutely! I also welcome it!”

Perhaps feeling moved, Jin Seon-ah, twirling her wavy hair, asked in a subtle tone, “Hmm... I can’t say no if you really want it. But it wouldn’t be for free, right? I’m quite expensive.”

“Haha, of course. Instead of a monthly salary, how about we compensate you with shares? The maximum share an auditor can receive is 3%, so we’ll give you 3% of the cooperative’s shares.”

Hearing this, Jin Seon-ah nodded. “Not bad. But I have conditions too.”

“What are they?”

“Hold regular board meetings at least twice a month. And I get to choose the location. Also, allow me unrestricted access to the company for work purposes. These are my conditions.”

Though her words were filled with personal interest, they weren’t unreasonable from Lee Chang-jin’s perspective.

Without hesitation, Lee Chang-jin readily agreed. “Alright, let’s do it. We’ll also provide you with an office in the company for your work.”

Just as the conversation was wrapping up, Yeong-mi, wearing a baker’s hat, brought out a large cake.

“Alright, let’s stop the complicated talk and start eating.”

The whipped cream cake, piled high with strawberries, had candles of various sizes on it. Seeing the cake with the words “Happy Birthday,” Dong-geun looked flustered.

“Whose birthday is it today? I didn’t bring any presents…”

“Haha, Dong-geun, it’s your birthday today. Did you forget your own birthday because you were so busy?”

As if it just dawned on him, Dong-geun counted the dates on his fingers and replied, “Oh, it really is… No wonder something felt different.”

“Clumsy as always. Everyone, let’s give a round of applause for today’s main character, Dong-geun.”

While Dong-geun, wearing a party hat, awkwardly smiled, Lee Chang-jin, holding a spoon instead of a microphone, sang in rhythm, “Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!”

As he blew out the candles, pop! Confetti burst out, and colorful paper gently floated down. Covered in glitter, Dong-geun laughed.

“Oh, you didn’t have to…”

“Is that all? This isn’t the end.”

Soon, a feast followed: oil-free roasted chicken, vongole pasta filled with clams, sizzling hamburg steak on a hot stone plate, freshly fried potato croquettes, and even a clear consommé soup that looked like something from a high-end hotel.

“Wow, what is all this?”

At Dong-geun’s astonished reaction, Yeong-mi proudly said, “I’m not good at Korean food, so I couldn’t make seaweed soup, but I tried my best. Enjoy.”

Dong-geun gazed at Yeong-mi, who gave a slight wink, with a dazed expression.

Seeing Dong-geun’s face filled with emotion, Lee Chang-jin nudged him in the side. “What are you doing? Aren’t you going to cut the cake as the main character?”

“Yes, yes, I will.”

A while later, after having eaten to his heart’s content, Dong-geun patted his belly and said, “This is the best birthday celebration I’ve ever had. Thank you all so much.”

“Yes. Yeong-mi, thank you so much. It must have been a lot of work.”

“It’s nothing. How could I refuse Seon-ah’s request? Besides, isn’t he going to be my brother-in-law someday? I need to earn some points now.”

At Yeong-mi’s words, Seon-ah laughed and waved her hand, saying, “Brother-in-law? More like brother.”

“What’s with this girl? Don't say things you don’t mean to a maiden.”

“Girl, stop pretending and playing coy. Or should I just take him away?”

“If you can, go ahead and try.”

As the two bickered, Lee Chang-jin smiled gently.

“Haha, let’s stop. Isn’t it a good day? You two seem to get along very well.”

“Don’t be ridiculous. She’s nothing without me. Anyway, I’ll be heading out first. It’s getting late. I’ll contact you once I’ve spoken to the residents and scheduled a meeting.”

“I’ll drive you, Seon-ah.”

“No, I have company, so I’ll go in my car.”

“Okay, take care.”

As Seon-ah drove away in her waiting car, Yeong-mi pouted from behind.

“See? She always does that when things get tough. I only put up with it because I have a good personality.”

“Haha. Thank you so much for today. The food was fantastic.”

“Goodbye, Changjin-ssi. Ah, Dong-geun-ssi, come visit often. I’ll give you a lot of service.”

“Yes, thank you. You did a great job.”

On the way home, as Lee Chang-jin drove, he asked, “Did you like the food? It might have been a bit greasy since it was Western.”

“No, it was so delicious I felt honored. I haven’t eaten like that in a while. But how did you know today was my birthday?”

“Ah, your father called a few days ago. He asked me to take care of your birthday.”

At that, Dong-geun grumbled, “My dad, who never even made me seaweed soup when I was at home, suddenly doing this... What’s gotten into him?”

“That’s just how a father’s heart is. You should call him and check in. Did you tell him you passed the exam?”

“No, not yet.”

“Call him as soon as you get home. He’s probably waiting eagerly.”

Following Lee Chang-jin’s advice, Dong-geun nodded obediently. “Alright. I’ll do as you say, hyung. But are all Seoul women that pretty? Their skin is so fair, they’re exceptional.”

“Ah, you mean Seon-ah? She is quite a standout beauty.”

“Yes... But I meant that lady with the baker’s hat. Yeong-mi. She’s incredibly pretty too. Especially her smile. I caught a glimpse of her side profile, and my heart skipped a beat.”

Hearing the innocent comment, Lee Chang-jin teased, “Oh, so that’s your type. If you’re interested, why not go for it?”

“Oh, come on. Someone like me? That’s impossible.”

Waving his hands in denial, Dong-geun’s reaction made Lee Chang-jin serious. “Why not? You’re going to be the head of the cooperative, you look fine, you’re diligent, and you don’t drink or smoke. You’re an excellent catch. With a decent job, there’s nothing to be ashamed of.”

“Thanks for thinking highly of me. But with her looks, there’s no way she doesn’t have a boyfriend. She’s out of my league.”

“Yeong-mi is still single. It’s better to try when there’s no competition. Who knows? She seemed to like you earlier.”

“Oh my, don’t joke around. I might take it seriously.”

“I’m serious. She seemed to have a liking for you. Life is all about timing. There’s no tree that doesn’t fall after being hit ten times.”

“Alright, I’ll take care of it myself, so please stop teasing.”

“Okay, I’ll let you know when we go to see the land. It’s your land, so you should check it out yourself.”

“Understood. Let me know when the time comes.”

It didn’t take long. About a week after the birthday party, they received a call.

“Changjin-ssi, I’ve scheduled a meeting with the residents. Be there by 2 PM.”

Receiving the call, Lee Chang-jin headed to Maljukgeori with Dong-geun. Carrying a box of Bacchus, Lee Chang-jin got off in front of the flower complex. Greenhouses lined up around the market with a parking lot.
