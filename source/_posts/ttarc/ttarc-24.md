## Episode 24: Return in Glory

“Yes, come in.”

The boarding house ajumma peeked her head in.

“Chang-jin, are you busy right now?”

“No, I’ve packed all my stuff.”

“That was quick. So, today is your last day?”

“Yes, it seems so. Have you found a new tenant?”

With those words, the ajumma shook her head.

“Well, I contacted the real estate office, but no one has come to see the room yet. People will come gradually, I suppose. I’m a bit sorry to ask, but could you extend the refund date for the deposit? It’s difficult to return a large sum since no new tenant has arrived yet. It’s an embarrassing request, but...”

“Yes, don’t worry about that. Just return it when you find a new tenant.”

For Lee Chang-jin, this was not a difficult request.

The ajumma’s face brightened immediately at Lee Chang-jin’s generous consent.

“Thank you for your consideration. It’s a bit sad to see you leave like this. Where are you headed now?”

“I’ve found an apartment near Hongjecheon in Seodaemun-gu.”

“Oh, an apartment? Why would someone who’s made a lot of money buy an apartment instead of a proper house?”

At that time, people with money still preferred standalone houses.

“Well, since I’m alone, it's hard to manage a house. I’ll be away often, and if a thief breaks in, it would be a big problem, wouldn’t it? So, I decided on a place where I can live comfortably.”

The place Lee Chang-jin was moving to was the Yujin Shopping Center, built on the covered Hongjecheon. In the 1970s, it was a rare mixed residential-commercial apartment. It was close to the new factory he would be commuting to, had a spacious 30-pyeong area with three bedrooms and a large living room, and most of the residents were social leaders such as officials, generals, and businessmen, so there was no need to worry about safety.

The ajumma nodded with a face full of envy.

“Well, that makes sense. Since you’re moving up in the world, it’s something to celebrate. Chang-jin, don’t forget about us when you become a chairman later.”

“Haha, how could I? Thanks to your care and the good energy I received, things have turned out well. Thank you for everything.”

Just before parting, the ajumma’s daughter handed something over.

“It’s a talisman I made for your business to prosper. They say it brings good luck.”

It was a small pig statue carved from stone.

The pig was holding an apple in its mouth as if it were smiling, looking quite whimsical.

She aspired to be a sculptor, and her skill was indeed impressive.

Lee Chang-jin gratefully accepted it.

“Why did you make this? I’ll cherish it on my desk. Thank you.”

“Oh, it’s nothing. It’s nothing compared to what you taught me. I’ll be rooting for you.”

“Alright, you’re in your last year of high school, right? Do well on your preliminary exams and don’t cause your parents any trouble.”

Lee Chang-jin took out his wallet and gently handed over some pocket money.

“Here, use this when you need it.”

“Thank you, teacher.”

The girl’s face turned red with happiness. Lee Chang-jin bowed deeply one last time.

“Ajumma, thank you for everything. I’ll visit whenever I get the chance.”

“Sure. Come by anytime. I’ll always leave the door open for you.”

“Thank you for saying so.”

After moving his belongings to Yujin Shopping Center and preparing for the Chuseok return trip, Lee Chang-jin had almost finished everything he needed to do in Seoul.

Now, he set off for his hometown with a light heart.

The ride was exceptionally comfortable, perhaps because it was a new car.

As he drove down the country roads, feeling the cool autumn breeze, a mix of emotions surged within him.

“It’s been almost five years.”

Since he had moved to Seoul for his studies, he had only gone down to his hometown once or twice during vacations, and after joining Mannheim, he hadn’t gone down at all.

In truth, in his previous life, Lee Chang-jin disliked his hometown. He loathed the grinding poverty that forced him to dig in rocky fields until his hands and feet were worn out, feed livestock, and clean up their waste every day...

His childhood involved waking up at dawn every day to fetch water from a well over 2 kilometers away.

He detested the severe poverty.

The barley hump that came without fail every spring.

The times when they barely survived on wild plants and thin gruel.

Even the rice rations from the government were scarce.

These experiences were traumatic for Lee Chang-jin.

Perhaps his desire to become a chaebol was driven by these reasons.

Thus, when his business was thriving, he sent money regularly, citing busyness as the reason, and after his downfall, he avoided going down out of shame.

But those past memories had now faded like old paper, replaced by a sense of excitement.

“Everyone must have changed a lot, right? How are they living?”

As he got closer to his hometown, Lee Chang-jin’s heart began to beat like a drum.

The scattered autumn leaves followed the winding mountain scenery.

As he entered the village entrance, he saw the familiar sight of a crooked jangseung (village guardian statue) welcoming him back.

* * *

Iksan, Jeollabuk-do.

A rural village that reminds one of a clan village.

The original name was “Makgol” because the terrain was blocked on three sides and open on one side.

To the west flowed the Geum River, and to the east, ripe ears of grain swayed in the fields.

It was a clan village established by people displaced from the north around the time of the Korean War, with about 300 households of five surnames including Lee and Byun living together.

At the village hall made of gray concrete blocks, preparations for the holiday were in full swing.

On one side, village women and daughters-in-law were frying jeon (Korean pancakes),

While old women were making songpyeon (half-moon rice cakes) on top of pine needles laid out with newspaper.

They were preparing food for the Chuseok holiday.

Next to them, men were pounding rice cakes with a mallet and drinking makgeolli.

After a while, the village chief came in with something.

“Ta-da! Look at this.”

“What’s this? Isn’t that a transistor radio? When did you get it?”

People with wide eyes each made a comment.

Until the mid-1960s, a radio was a household appliance that only wealthy families could afford.

Although it became more common in the 70s, it was still considered a rare item in rural areas.

Seeing people’s interest, the village chief boasted.

“Look at this. My son sent it as a holiday gift.”

“Hey, it looks really nice. But isn’t it a smuggled item?”

“What are you talking about? It’s a legitimate purchase from Seoul, not some smuggled goods.”

The village chief shook his head, irritated by the jealous comments from the villagers gathered in the hall.

“Then how did you get it?”

“My son bought it at a high price from Sewoon Shopping Center in Seoul. It’s a Japanese Panax product.”

“Panax... Panax what? What’s that?”

“It’s a Japanese company. Don’t you know that, you ignorant fool? It’s a high-end export electronic product from Japan to the U.S.”

Panasonic had been producing radios since the Japanese colonial era.

An elder in the village chimed in, trying to show off his knowledge.

“If it’s an export product to the U.S., it’s not sold in Korea. How did Bong-man get such a high-end radio?”

“There’s always a way. As you know, my son works as a clerk at a general store in Bangsan Market in Seoul, right? He sent this to me after being promoted to store owner. He said he got it through the introduction of the shopping center owner.”

The village chief’s boastful words made the people envious.

“It looks nice, but let’s see how it functions. Turn it on.”

As he tuned the frequency, a crackling sound was followed by old trot music.

“Wow...! The sound is good. The speaker is excellent.”

“So how much did he pay for it?”

“Don’t be shocked. This cost 20,000 won. 20,000 won.”

“Oh my, 20,000 won? Wow, that’s a lot of money... Bong-man made a big decision.”

“Right? It looks like he’s finally becoming a responsible person.”

As the compliments continued, the village chief’s shoulders lifted with pride.

While everyone was preoccupied with admiring the radio, an annoyed woman suddenly spoke up.

“There he goes again... What’s with the son’s gift? A clerk’s salary is barely enough, and that kid who wastes money on drinking and gambling, where did he get the money? He must have bought it himself.”

“Just let it be. He wants to show off his son a bit. What can we do?”

“It’s always the same with him. Even last time, what’s the big deal about a radio? If you want to see real filial piety, look at the town’s true filial son.”

“The real filial son is actually Chang-jin. Compared to Chang-jin, who can stand up to him?”

“Exactly. Chang-jin is the best. Isn’t he the only one from here who went to Korea University? And on a full scholarship at that.”

“Right. It’s amazing that he got into the difficult Korea University without any private tutoring. There was even an interview about him. He graduated at the top of his class, didn’t he?”

“He’s a remarkable kid.”

“He’s always been special, hasn’t he? But he seems busy these days. He hasn’t come down at all.”

“If you think about it, it’s been about five years, right? Since he got a job in Seoul, he hasn’t come down once.”

Watching the surroundings warily, the woman who had been quietly working asked a cautious question.

“Hey, sister? Is Chang-jin coming this time?”

“I don’t know. There hasn’t been any talk. He might come, or he might not.”

The woman, who was focused on making jeon, answered with a hint of uncertainty.

“Does that company make people work even during holidays? Isn’t that Mannheim or whatever a foreign company?”

“He’s a manager. Important men are always busy. Why are you so concerned about someone else’s son? Just focus on picking those pepper stems.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

As Chang-jin’s mother, who had been concentrating on her work, stood up to stretch her aching back, she looked around and asked in wonder.

“By the way, where is my husband? Chang-sik, have you seen your father?”

Chang-sik, who was helping to make songpyeon, looked around and said.

“Huh? Father? I haven’t seen him for a while. Maybe he’s gone to see the cows again?”

“Does it take that long to see the cows? You’re so careless. Go out and find your father. He might be waiting for your brother at the hilltop.”

“Yes... I understand.”

Chang-sik dusted off his hands and went outside, where he indeed found his father, just as his mother had said.

Seeing his father in a navy jacket scanning the hilltop, Chang-sik sighed and muttered.

“Father, why are you out here again? It’s cold, come inside.”

“I was feeling a bit stuffy inside, so I came out for some fresh air.”

Guessing his father’s true intentions, Chang-sik clicked his tongue.

“Father, are you waiting for my brother again? Come inside, the food will be ready soon.”

“Just a bit longer... I'm not hungry yet.”

Despite Chang-sik’s attempts to strike up a conversation, his father’s gaze remained fixed on the distant hilltop.

Feeling frustrated, Chang-sik grumbled.

“Aigoo... Father, really. Why are you waiting for a son who doesn’t even show up? My brother’s not coming. Forget about that unfilial son and come inside.”

“What did you say? Unfilial son? Now? Is that something you should say about your brother?”

Realizing his slip of the tongue, Chang-sik stammered.

“No, that’s not what I meant... Father...”

“You brat, do you know how much your brother has done for us, and you still say that? Have you forgotten that he sent his holiday bonuses to pay off our debts and buy land? That’s why we’re barely able to survive now. How dare you say such nonsense? You ungrateful brat...”

“I’m sorry...”

Feeling overwhelmed by the scolding, Chang-sik was at a loss for words.

Just then, his uncle Dong-sik came out to save the day.

“Hey, old man, let’s cut the nagging. The jeon is all done, so let’s have some makgeolli and eat with the jeon.”

“Just a bit longer. I’ll watch for Chang-jin for five more minutes.”

“Alright, who says don’t wait? The mung bean and potato jeon are getting cold. Let’s eat first.”

As his uncle continued to urge him, the old man reluctantly turned his feet back towards the house.

At that moment, they heard the sound of an engine, and a sleek car approached the village hall.

“What’s that? It’s not a car from the town.”

“It’s not just one.”

Behind the car was a three-wheeled truck loaded with goods.

The simple country folks couldn’t take their eyes off the fancy car.

The car stopped smoothly in front of the old man, who stood on guard, wondering if something was wrong.

A young man in a neat suit got out of the car shortly after.

“Isn’t that Chang-jin? It’s Chang-jin, right?”

The old man’s face lit up with a smile upon seeing Lee Chang-jin.

Neatly dressed, Lee Chang-jin waved and apologized.

“I’m sorry, Father. I came as early as I could, but I was delayed by packing. I’m really late.”

“No, you’re not late. You’ve had a long journey. Have you eaten?”

“Not yet. How have you been, Father?”

“I’m always the same. What about this car? Is it from your company?”

Lee Chang-jin chuckled and replied.

“No, it’s my car. Excuse me, can you guys unload the stuff here?”

“Yes, boss.”

The workers from the truck began unloading the goods.

“What? This is your car? And you’re called boss?”

“Haha, I’ll explain everything one by one. Let’s move the stuff first.”

The workers began carrying the items into the village hall.

A crowd of people came out to welcome Lee Chang-jin’s return.

His mother, who came running out in her socks, was at a loss for words upon seeing him.

“Mother, I’m home.”

“Chang-jin... my eldest son...”

Her emotions overwhelmed her, and she almost began to cry.

Perhaps because it had been so long since they last met, she hugged her son tightly and affectionately stroked his face.

“Let me see. You’ve lost a lot of weight. You can’t skip meals, especially when you’re doing big work.”

“Don’t worry, Mother. I always eat the side dishes you send me.”

“Come on, let’s go inside and hear about how you’ve been.”

Once seated, Lee Chang-jin began to share his stories.

Listening with great interest, Chang-sik exclaimed.

“So, you’re running an industrial company in Seoul now?”

“Yes, but it’s just a small business. It’s only been a short time since I started.”

“A small business? That’s ridiculous. How can you drive such a nice car with a small business? How much have you made so far this year?”

“It’s still in the early stages, so it’s not much. So far, about 1 billion won, and by the end of the year, it should be around 1.5 to 1.6 billion won.”

“What? That much?”

The people, shocked by the mention of billions, had their eyes wide open.

For the simple rural folks, such an amount was unimaginable.

“Wow, you’ve made it, Chang-jin. I knew you were different.”

“See? My son is this capable.”

His father’s shoulders lifted with pride, and a smile appeared on Lee Chang-jin’s face.

If I had known they would be this happy, I should have come down more often.

“What’s all this stuff you brought?”

“Oh, these are thermal underwear and small gifts for the village elders. Please, everyone, take one.”

“Really?”

The delighted people at the village hall each took a gift.

The most impressive was a giant box that was about half the height of a person.

As they opened the box, a heavy item appeared.

Everyone’s eyes widened in unison.

“What’s this? Isn’t this a TV?”

It was an Osung TV, which would have cost around 150,000 won at that time.

Seeing the TV, the villagers couldn’t hide their envy.

Almost as if he intended for everyone to hear, Dong-sik’s uncle loudly exclaimed.

“Wow... Amazing. As expected of Chang-jin. It’s a stark contrast with someone else!”

The village chief’s face turned red, feeling embarrassed.

For the village chief, it was as if he wanted to crawl into a hole. Lee Chang-jin added,

“Oh, I specifically bought two. One for the house and one for the village hall. Also, here’s a bankbook in Father’s name. You must have had a hard time all this while. Use it to buy whatever you need.”

Lee Chang-jin took out a bankbook from his suit jacket and handed it to his father.

Seeing the amount in the account, his father’s eyes widened in shock.
