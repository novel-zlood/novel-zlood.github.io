## Episode 114: Adnan Khashoggi

"Just wait a moment, the minister will be here shortly."

A man wearing a turban guided Lee Chang-jin and his party to the reception room.

Having arranged a meeting, Lee Chang-jin, along with Jung Ho-sung, visited Minister Mubarak's residence.

"Wow, this room is magnificent. It's at least ten times bigger than ours, isn't it?"

The accompanying group looked around the spacious reception room in amazement. The house, reminiscent of a medieval palace, was very comfortable and well air-conditioned.

Amidst the room, a large golden bull's head statue stood out, and the gold-decorated walls featured illustrations of Bedouins in the desert.

Even the carpet laid out in the reception room was the epitome of luxury.

As they admired the room filled with artworks, the man in the turban brought out tea and refreshments.

"It seems the minister is delayed by another meeting. Please have some tea while you wait."

"Thank you for your hospitality."

In Saudi Arabia, unlike Westerners, punctuality is not a priority, so the group had anticipated this. The steaming tea was at an appropriate temperature for drinking and had a slightly sweet taste, perhaps due to the inclusion of dates.

How long had they waited?

Suddenly, music started playing from somewhere.

The clear and pure sound of the piano caught everyone's attention.

Koo Chang-dong, who was drinking tea, tilted his head in curiosity.

"This music sounds familiar. I often hear it on the radio at night these days."

"Oh, this? It's a piece called 'Ballade Pour Adeline.'"

When Lee Chang-jin recognized it, Bayezad showed a look of surprise.

"Oh, Mr. Lee, you seem quite knowledgeable about classical music."

"Not really. It's a piece I like, so I listen to it often. It somehow puts my mind at ease."

'Ballade Pour Adeline' is a piece composed by Paul de Senneville and has become one of the most globally successful albums. It was especially popular in Europe and Asia, selling over 7 million copies worldwide. Richard Clayderman, who made a mega-hit with his debut, became one of the most commercially successful pianists globally by the end of the 20th century.

As Lee Chang-jin enjoyed the flowing melody, he subtly asked Bayezad.

"By the way, who is playing this piece? The rhythm and sound are quite pleasant."

"It is probably the minister’s wife playing."

"Her skills are exceptional. She has a professional touch."

"Ah, the minister’s wife is originally a pianist."

"Oh, is that so?"

Bayezad, who was familiar with the local context, gave Lee Chang-jin a discreet tip.

"Mrs. Mubarak is originally from a prestigious French family. It was quite the gossip when she married into such a conservative place from a European noble family."

"Oh, that's quite romantic."

Thanks to the soothing music and Bayezad’s charming words, the wait didn’t feel too tiresome. After about two hours past the scheduled time, Minister Mubarak, dressed in traditional white Kandoura, appeared in the reception room with his entourage.

When Lee Chang-jin stood up, Koo Chang-dong, who was stuffing his mouth with refreshments, also hurriedly stood up.

"Nice to meet you. I am Lee Chang-jin."

Minister Mubarak, with a bushy beard, had a large and noble appearance. Though his once handsome face had grown plump over time, traces of his good looks remained.

"Apologies. The meeting ran late, hence my delay."

Slumping into a chair, Mubarak asked for some cold water, seemingly feeling hot.

True to his reputation for being free-spirited, he paid no heed to formalities.

Once he cooled down, Mubarak adjusted his posture, and Lee Chang-jin began his briefing.

"…Therefore, we believe our prices and quality are much more reasonable than those from the Sun Group. They are also well-suited to the desert climate, being highly breathable and more economical."

Minister Mubarak, leaning back in his chair, listened to the explanation.

Occasionally, he shifted uncomfortably and nodded perfunctorily but didn’t say much during the briefing.

Nevertheless, Lee Chang-jin completed the briefing steadfastly.

"Minister, is there any part of the estimate that you are dissatisfied with?"

The minister responded with a disinterested expression as if he hadn’t heard anything.

"Oh, it's not that. I’ve had a tiring day, so it was hard to concentrate on the explanation. Overall, it was a good briefing. I’ll have my staff review the details separately, so leave the offer documents here."

Lee Chang-jin, who had expected a definitive answer today, felt very disappointed.

After the meeting, Lee Chang-jin asked Bayezad what was going on.

"The minister only gave a general response. What’s happening, Bayezad? This is different from what was initially said."

"Honestly, I’m not sure what’s going on. I’ll find out immediately."

Bayezad was equally puzzled by Minister Mubarak’s lukewarm response.

The next day, Lee Chang-jin found out the reason. Bayezad delivered bad news with a distressed look.

"Mr. Lee, we have a problem. It seems Adnan Khashoggi has gotten involved in this matter."

"Khashoggi? That wasn’t mentioned before."

"It appears the Sun Group is determined. They moved very discreetly, and we were caught off guard. This is my oversight."

Sensing the tense situation, Koo Chang-dong cautiously asked.

"Who exactly is this Khashoggi? Is he some kind of king?"

Next to him, Jung Ho-sung chimed in.

"In some ways, he’s more than that. He’s the most successful arms dealer in the Middle East."

Adnan Khashoggi was a legendary figure among Middle Eastern arms dealers, involved in all aircraft and weapon transactions that Saudi Arabia acquired.

Khashoggi, whose father was the personal physician to the Saudi king, made a fortune as an arms broker between Saudi Arabia and the U.S., amassing an enormous wealth of approximately 4 billion dollars by the 1970s.

Koo Chang-dong groaned upon hearing the details.

"Wow, the Sun Group really brought in a heavyweight."

"If it’s Khashoggi, the commission won’t be small either... This is a bit troubling."

Jung Ho-sung’s expression was equally grim. While not underestimating Bayezad’s capabilities, the opponent’s stature was overwhelming. Bayezad, having composed himself, calmly spoke.

"If Khashoggi is our opponent, the chances of winning this bid are slim. Mr. Lee, if you wish to withdraw, let’s do so cleanly. I’ll cover the costs incurred so far."

"No, we cannot give up now. Besides, we are not in Saudi Arabia, are we? There’s no need to be intimidated by a name."

Bayezad’s offer, which involved personal losses, was promptly rejected by Lee Chang-jin.

Having come this far, giving up would mean all efforts were in vain. Lee Chang-jin had no intention of abandoning the project, especially with many people already involved.

"But Mr. Lee, Khashoggi is not an easy opponent."

"It's not over yet, is it? Don’t we have a card to turn the tables?"

After thinking for a moment, Bayezad responded.

"Well... In about two weeks, there will be a party hosted by the minister’s wife at their residence. It’s a birthday celebration for the wife. The minister is known to be very devoted to his wife, so if we can win her favor during the party, we might succeed."

In desert regions, there is a tradition of hospitality towards foreigners and travelers. Being a participant in the bidding, Lee Chang-jin was also entitled to receive an invitation as a guest.

However, when it came to choosing a gift, he was at a loss. Then, a vague idea came to him.

"Precious gems or expensive items might be counterproductive. We need a special gift, don’t we?"

"A special gift?"

"Mrs. Mubarak is a pianist, isn’t she? The piece she played last time was definitely by Clayderman. How about inviting him?"

"Are you suggesting we invite Clayderman?"

"Yes. Honestly, what could a royal wife possibly lack? She must have received countless jewels and gifts. What impact would money have? We need to appeal to her heart. For a classical music fan, what could be a better gift than meeting a star?"

Bayezad found the idea quite plausible.

If money couldn’t win, then appealing to the heart was the way to go.

Fortunately, there was a connection through Brandon.

"I know someone at the record label Clayderman is signed with. Although he’s gained popularity with this album, he’s not yet a big shot, so inviting him might be possible. However, bringing him to the UAE will require a significant amount of money."

"How much do you think it will cost?"

"I’m not sure, but I expect the performance fee alone will be at least $100,000."

Including round-trip airfare and accommodation, it would be more. But Lee Chang-jin didn’t hesitate.

"Pay whatever they ask. Please arrange the schedule to coincide with the party. Also, ensure the minister’s side is aware and can coordinate the schedule."

"Of course. I’ll inform Bayezad."

Having made the decision, Lee Chang-jin acted swiftly. He had to complete all preparations before attending the party in two weeks. Fortunately, with the help of a KOTRA resident officer connected to Park Seung-hoon, who was on a business trip in the UK, they were able to contact Clayderman.

Meanwhile, the invitation also arrived at the hotel where Lee Chang-jin was staying.

On the appointed day, Lee Chang-jin attended the party with a bouquet of flowers that Mrs. Mubarak liked the most. The palace-like house was decorated grandly like a ballroom, with a fountain flowing with wine and flowers brought in overflowing.

Despite arriving an hour early, the house was already bustling with invited guests.

"Wow, this is even more extravagant than during the day."

"Don’t act provincial. Be confident. We represent the company."

"Yes, I understand. But being in such a crowded place makes me feel queasy. I think I need some herbal medicine to calm down."

Koo Chang-dong kept adjusting his collar, feeling awkward in his first tuxedo. Abu Dhabi, the most open city in the Middle East, had a diverse and free dress code among the attendees.

"Ah, there’s Mrs. Mubarak."

Mrs. Mubarak, in a dress, was greeting the endless stream of guests.

With fair skin and petite stature, Mrs. Mubarak stood out with her beauty.

Although there were slight shadows under her eyes, it only seemed to enhance her charm.

Guests at the party handed her expensive gifts one by one.

Bayezad, surveying the surroundings, whispered, pointing at someone.

"That’s Esam Khashoggi. He’s Adnan’s younger brother. Seems like he’s attending in place of his brother."

Unlike his short and stout brother, Esam was tall and handsome.

Spotting Bayezad, Esam waved and approached them.
