## Episode 136: The Engagement

“They’re not lifting the suspension of operations?”

“No, sir. They won’t budge. It seems someone higher up is putting pressure on them.”

Nam Tae-gon, his face grim, rested his chin on his hand, deep in thought.

‘Someone higher up… Don’t tell me it’s the VIP himself? Did we give them too little in political contributions this time?’

The current administration, grappling with plummeting approval ratings due to economic instability, was searching for a scapegoat. Even if Lee Cheol-song was a stickler for rules, there was no way a single public official could stand against a behemoth like Taeyang Group.

Perhaps the 5 billion won fine wasn't just a warning to stay in line, but also a signal to cough up more funds.

His head swimming with possibilities, Nam Tae-gon questioned his secretary again.

“This is a headache. Fine, I understand. How much titanium dioxide do we have left in stock?”

“Sir, we only have about a month’s worth left.”

“What? How can that be? Don’t we usually have at least three months’ worth in reserve?”

“Well… you see, President Nam Tae-hoon recently sold off all the emergency reserves… so we’re running low on stock.”

“What? That idiot! He sold off all the reserves at once? What was he thinking?!”

Nam Tae-gon felt a surge of anger.

Barely suppressing his rage, he asked incredulously, “So, what’s the situation now?”

“We’ve secured enough for our white goods production, but we’re severely short on the paint-grade titanium dioxide we need for next month’s construction project.”

Titanium dioxide was used in a wide range of industries, but shortages were practically unheard of. Every company maintained at least a six-month supply in preparation for any unforeseen circumstances.

However, Taeyang Group, accustomed to self-producing this material, had been relatively lax about maintaining such reserves. 

They had always operated under the assumption that any shortage could be easily addressed by running their factories at full capacity.

But this time, their complacency had come back to bite them. With operations suspended, a significant number of Taeyang Group’s ongoing projects were now on the verge of grinding to a halt.

But there was no use crying over spilled milk. Nam Tae-gon asked urgently, “Have we looked into importing?”

“We’re in contact with TAYCA in Japan, but since they primarily operate on a pre-order system, their production is already backlogged. Even if they agree, it’ll take at least three to four months considering customs clearance.”

“Three to four months… You’re saying we won’t be able to operate normally for at least two to three months?”

“Yes, sir. I’m afraid that’s unavoidable.”

“Damn it…”

Nam Tae-gon cursed under his breath.

With the government breathing down their necks, looking for any excuse to squeeze the conglomerates, this was the last thing he needed.

“This won’t do. Set up a meeting with Daese Chemicals.”

“Sir? You mean with CEO Lee Chang-jin?”

“Things being what they are, what other choice do we have? We need to at least talk to him. And this will be a good opportunity to see what kind of man he is.”

Following the Chairman’s order, the secretary contacted Daese Chemicals in Seodaemun-gu. Lee Chang-jin, upon hearing the news, couldn't help but smirk.

“Taeyang wants to meet me?”

“Yes. They said they’d like to meet as soon as possible.”

Already aware of the suspension of operations at Taeyang Chemical, Lee Chang-jin found their eagerness amusing.

“Seems like they’re in a hurry. For the owner of a group like that to personally get involved…”

“What should we do?”

“Let them wait. Just tell them I’m unavailable due to personal reasons for now. Let the thirsty ones come to the well. If they’re desperate enough, they'll come crawling back.”

Besides, with his engagement ceremony approaching, Lee Chang-jin was genuinely busy.

As Daese Chemicals continued to postpone the meeting, Taeyang Group grew increasingly anxious.

“What’s with all this nonsense? Can’t even schedule a simple meeting because he’s ‘busy’?”

Frustrated by the constant rejections, Nam Tae-gon finally decided to send one of his executives in person.

“Someone from Taeyang Group is here.”

“Who is it?”

“Executive Director Shin Seon-ho, sir.”

Shin Seon-ho was one of Nam Tae-gon’s most trusted men. 

Yeo Jin-joo, after glancing at the business card, greeted the guest politely.

Leading him to the reception room, she offered him coffee.

“Welcome to Daese Chemicals. May I ask what brings you here today?”

“Chairman Nam Tae-gon wishes to meet with CEO Lee. Please inform him that he’d like to meet as soon as possible.”

Shin's arrogant tone caused Yeo Jin-joo's face to stiffen slightly. But she was a consummate professional. 

Composing herself, she replied with a courteous smile, “I apologize, but CEO Lee is currently out of the office on business. If you’d like to schedule a meeting, please make a formal request.”

“Look, we’ve been trying to set up a meeting, but you keep refusing. That's why I came here in person.”

As Yeo Jin-joo struggled to maintain her composure in the face of the executive’s rudeness, Secretary General Lee Chang-sik suddenly appeared.

“What’s going on here?”

“Sir, we have an executive from Taeyang Group here who wants to see the CEO. He’s asking for a meeting.”

“Oh, really? I’ll handle this. You can go back to work now, Manager Yeo.”

Lee Chang-sik calmly took a seat and gestured for the executive to do the same.

“I’m Secretary General Lee Chang-sik. I manage the CEO’s schedule, so please speak with me.”

“We've sent several meeting requests, but haven’t heard back, so I came here personally. Can we schedule a meeting with CEO Lee?”

“Well, the CEO has some personal matters to attend to and won’t be available for meetings for the time being.”

“What could he possibly be doing that’s more important than this? Is there a wedding or a funeral he needs to attend?”

“You guessed it. It’s his engagement ceremony. He won’t be able to confirm any appointments until after that.”

Shin Seon-ho scoffed, “Wow, that’s quite the elaborate engagement if it requires him to clear his schedule.”

Lee Chang-sik maintained his polite smile, “Marriage is an important life event. There might be a two to three-day window after the engagement ceremony. We might be able to fit in a meeting then. It would be best if you came in person, as the CEO is quite busy. That's the best we can offer Chairman Nam. After that, he has a series of overseas business trips, so please keep that in mind.”

Shin Seon-ho, baffled, retorted, “So you're saying your CEO is too important to meet with our Chairman unless he personally comes to see him?”

“Yes, we apologize for the inconvenience. However, we’ve conveyed our position. Please note that a meeting is only possible after the engagement ceremony, and contact us when you have a confirmed time. I have other urgent matters to attend to, so please excuse me.”

His words were polite, but the message was clear: get out. Just as Shin Seon-ho was about to retort, Goo Chang-dong and the other bodyguards entered the office. 

They were all large men, tall and muscular.

Goo Chang-dong, with a nonchalant air, casually placed his hand on Shin Seon-ho’s shoulder.

“Say, Mr. Executive Director, what’s with all the commotion in someone else’s company? If you have any complaints, why don’t you talk to me directly?”

Shin Seon-ho felt intimidated by Goo Chang-dong’s imposing figure. 

Swallowing nervously, he tried to regain his composure, not wanting to back down.

“You’ll regret this.”

“Duly noted. Now, if you’re done, please see yourself out.”

Forcibly ushered out, Shin Seon-ho fumed, but the firmly shut door remained closed.

Humiliated, he had no choice but to return to headquarters.

Back at Taeyang, Nam Tae-gon anxiously awaited Shin Seon-ho's return, eager to hear about the meeting.

“So, did you go to Daese Chemicals? Were you able to schedule a meeting?”

“Well… CEO Lee is busy and won’t be available for a while.”

“What? You went there personally, and he still refused?”

“Yes, sir. I didn't even get to see CEO Lee. I only met with some lowly secretary, and he was incredibly arrogant. A nobody with no manners whatsoever.”

Shin Seon-ho conveniently omitted the details of the actual conversation, painting himself in a favorable light and badmouthing Lee Chang-sik.

Nam Tae-gon’s anger flared at the description of the secretary’s disrespect.

‘That arrogant punk! How dare a mere secretary tell me to come to him!’

Having lived a life where he rarely encountered the word “no,” Nam Tae-gon felt deeply insulted.

However, he was a businessman at heart. In this situation, he was the one in need.

His face, initially flushed with anger, gradually regained its composure.

“So, where did you say this engagement ceremony is taking place?”

***

Three days later, at the Baekje Hotel engagement hall.

Spring had arrived, and the weather was beautiful. The sky was clear and bright.

Today was the day of Lee Chang-jin and Jin Seon-ah’s engagement ceremony.

The hall was adorned with flowers, and a magnificent ice sculpture of a dolphin graced the center of the dance floor.

Family members from both sides were busy making last-minute checks on the food and the ceremony proceedings.

As the guests began to arrive, the elders from both families stood at the entrance, welcoming them.

“Oh my, it’s been a while!”

“I believe the last time we saw each other was this time last year. I trust you’ve been well?”

Waiters bustled around, making final preparations for the two families as they made their rounds, greeting their guests.

Lee Chang-jin’s relatives, including Uncle Dong-sik, all dressed in their finest suits, had also arrived.

Uncle Dong-sik, looking around the lavish venue with wide eyes, was chastised by Dong-geun.

“Dad, come on, get a hold of yourself. Stop gawking like you’ve never seen anything like this before.”

“I know, I know. But this is something else. I thought it would be a simple affair since it’s just an engagement, but I guess it’s different when you’re marrying into a family like hers.”

“What’s the point of saying all this? I heard she's from the wealthiest family in Korea. They’re rolling in cash.”

“Really? Is that true?”

“Of course it’s true. Why would I lie about something like that? I heard they gifted hyung an island and a yacht as an engagement present. And they even bought him a brand new car a while back.”

Uncle Dong-sik, green with envy, smacked his lips.

“Wow, they sure do things big. They're on a whole other level. I’m so jealous. My brother struck gold with this one. He must be so proud of his son.”

“Proud? He didn’t do anything. Chang-jin made it on his own.”

Startled, Uncle Dong-sik turned around to see CEO Kim Cheol-ho standing there.

His face brightened at the sight of his old friend.

“Oh, hyung-nim! It’s been a while! When did you get here?”

“I've been here for a while. And Dong-sik, why do you always have to run your mouth off like that? Stop spreading baseless rumors. It’s bad luck to gossip, especially at a happy occasion like this.”

“I apologize, hyung-nim. I was just… impressed. I bet Chang-jin’s father must be walking on air right now, having such an accomplished son. Must be nice.”

“Having a son who’s too successful can be a problem too. It's a good thing Chang-jin’s mother lives a quiet life in the countryside. If she were here, it would be chaos. You have no idea how many people have been asking me for favors because of Chang-jin. I'm just glad I won't have to deal with those pesky matchmakers anymore.”

The truth was, Kim Cheol-ho had been through a lot. Since it was nearly impossible to get in touch with Lee Chang-jin directly, people had been hounding him relentlessly, hoping to use his connection to the family to their advantage.

As Uncle Dong-sik, oblivious to Kim Cheol-ho’s plight, continued to ramble on, Dong-geun’s wife, who had been listening quietly, suddenly interjected with a sharp glare.

“Are you telling me you’ve been playing the stock market again? You promised me you wouldn’t!”

“Honey, not here! You’re embarrassing me in front of everyone…”

“Then when are you going to pay me back? You have some nerve. It’s been ages since you borrowed that money!”

Just as Uncle Dong-sik was about to crumble under the pressure, the emcee’s voice boomed through the hall, offering him a much-needed escape.

“Presenting the groom!”

All eyes turned to Lee Chang-jin, dashing in his black tuxedo and white gloves, as he made his way down the aisle.
