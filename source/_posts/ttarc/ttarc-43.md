Episode 42: Samcheong Park

Deok-gu handed over a warm cup of tea and said, 

“It’s barley tea. Made from roasted barley.”

“Thank you. It has a nice, rich aroma.”

“Thank you so much for your help. Thanks to you, we saved a lot of time. By the way, have you done this kind of work often, sir? You seem very skilled.”

“Haha, this is my first time. But have you both had dinner yet?”

“Not yet. We spent the whole day catching Childeuk and cleaning the coop.”

“If you haven’t eaten, why don't you join me? Actually, I brought some snacks to share, but they’ve already gone cold… I was about to have a bite myself.”

Deok-gu politely declined, waving his hand.

“No, you’ve helped us so much already. I’m fine, really.”

“Why refuse when the boss is offering? Let’s just go.”

“Yes, let’s go together.”

Urged by Bok-soon, Deok-gu hesitated before agreeing.

“Then, if it’s not too much trouble… I feel it’s too forward since this is our first meeting.”

“Come on, hyung, don’t feel burdened. It’s just a meal, right? You can treat me next time.”

“Then, I’ll join you without any shame.”

“How about Uijeongbu Army Stew? There’s a pretty famous place nearby.”

“Why be picky when you’re getting a free meal? Uijeongbu Army Stew sounds great. Let’s go!”

The group, having changed out of their work clothes, got into the GM Record. Lee Chang-jin headed to a well-known Uijeongbu Army Stew restaurant in Seodaemun-gu.

Since it was dinner time, the place was bustling. Once seated, Lee Chang-jin ordered.

“Add ramen noodles and rice cakes, and give us five servings. Oh, and three orders of rolled omelette.”

Koreans began eating a dish named “Army Stew” in earnest starting in the 1970s. Before then, the dish existed but wasn’t specifically named.

The name “Army Stew” came into use in the '70s when domestic ham and sausages started being added to the stew. With the development of the meat processing industry, affordable and long-lasting canned ham became available, making the dish more familiar and common.

About ten minutes later, a large pot of Army Stew was brought out. It was filled with salami, spam, tofu, onions, seasoned ground meat, and canned beans, along with a generous amount of vegetables like green onions and crown daisies on one side of the pot. A slice of cheese was placed on top of the cooked ramen.

“Wow, this is a generous portion.”

Maybe it was because they hadn’t eaten since lunch, but the sight of the bubbling Army Stew made their mouths water.

The curly-haired lady who brought the pot winked at them.

“Young man, you’re handsome, so I added extra sausages for you.”

“Thank you, auntie. You look like a newlywed yourself.”

“Oh, you. Don’t just say sweet things, come by often, show your face.”

Though she said that, she didn’t seem to dislike it at all.

A little later, the server lady came and ladled out portions of the stew, saying,

“The rice cakes and ramen are cooked, give it a try.”

Dong-geun blew on his ramen and slurped it up. Deok-gu and Bok-soon, who seemed quite hungry, kept refilling their plates with stew.

“Ma’am, can we get more dongchimi broth here!”

“Yes, coming right up!”

After downing a bowl of broth, Bok-soon smacked his lips.

“Wow, this really hits the spot. The broth is so spicy and refreshing, it would be great for a hangover.”

“This place is quite famous. By the way, I noticed earlier that you two seem very adept at handling chickens. Did you both go to agricultural high schools?”

“Yes, I’m from Suwon. My hometown is in Chungbuk, though. My cousin runs a chicken farm, so I helped out there during vacations.”

“You have quite some experience. That’s impressive.”

Dong-geun chimed in.

“Haha, compared to Deok-gu hyung here, I’m nothing. This hyung even ran his own chicken farm. He raised up to 20,000 chickens!”

“Oh, that’s quite a serious operation.”

During a time when most farms were small-scale, such a large-scale farming operation was rare.

At Lee Chang-jin’s admiration, Deok-gu shyly scratched his head.

“It’s not that great. I started big without much planning and ended up failing. A sudden cold snap and strong wind blew away the coop’s tent, and to make matters worse, the oil shock hit. The chickens died en masse due to poor heating, and I lost everything. I didn’t even break even. After failing, I realized I had started the business too recklessly. Now, I’m learning the basics to avoid failing again.”

“Well, they say failure is the mother of success. Do you need anything for raising chickens? If I can help, I’d be happy to.”

Deok-gu shrugged at Lee Chang-jin’s offer.

“Discomfort is part of daily life. Who starts with everything perfectly in place? This place is well-ventilated and has a consistent humidity level, so it’s quite comfortable. The problem is after summer.”

“After summer, you mean from autumn onwards?”

“This warehouse isn’t insulated. It’s cool and nice in the summer, but winter is a different story. It would cost a lot to remodel the warehouse into a proper chicken coop, and the owner wouldn’t easily allow it.”

“Hmmm… that’s a significant issue.”

“Actually, the chickens we raise aren’t proper commercial chickens. The reason we breed them with Childeuk is that he’s the only pedigree rooster left. Even when everything else was lost, I didn’t sell him. But now he’s getting old, and I don’t know what will happen next.”

The broilers we buy in the market are produced through three stages: Grandparent Stock (GPS) → Parent Stock (PS) → Broilers. The grandparent stock is entirely imported, making it expensive.

A grandparent stock chick costs about a month's salary for a production worker, so it was understandable why Deok-gu cherished Childeuk so much. Dong-geun, however, nonchalantly commented,

“Hyungnim, you worry too much. How long has it been since we started, and you’re already worrying about the future? We’ll think about that when the time comes. For now, let’s focus on doing what we need to do.”

“Haha, you’re right.”

During the meal, Lee Chang-jin was given a brief overview of the poultry business. Excluding the laying hens, broilers are slaughtered once they reach the desired weight, and then sold either whole or in parts, used for animal feed, or further processed for the market.

“There’s more to the poultry business than just selling chickens. Chickens are animals with no waste. Chicken manure is processed into chemical fertilizer, and the feathers are collected and used to make winter jackets.”

“Hmmm, the uses are more diverse than I thought.”

“That’s why I’m asking, Mr. Lee, do you have any interest in the poultry industry?”

“Poultry? Haha, well, I’m an engineer at heart, so I haven’t thought deeply about it…”

“Then how about considering it now? Actually, now is a good time to start a poultry business. The income tax law has been revised, so if you start livestock farming, you get a seven-year income tax exemption. Since last year, several associations have merged, making conditions much better.”

Lee Chang-jin cautiously countered,

“Hmmm, that contradicts what I’ve been reading in the papers. They say feed prices have doubled since the oil shock of the latter half of '73.”

“While the number of chickens has temporarily decreased, it’s a short-term phenomenon. Supply is still far below demand. Egg and chicken prices have been steadily rising. Statistics show that compared to 1961, domestic chicken consumption has more than doubled, and egg consumption has increased by 2.5 times.”

Lee Chang-jin questioned again,

“There are substitutes like pork and beef, aren’t there? Why are you so sure this will be successful?”

“Pigs and cows cost much more to raise and have a lower turnover rate. Chickens can be shipped after about 70 days, whereas pigs take about six months, and cows take 27-29 months. It’s clear which one is more productive.”

Listening to Deok-gu’s passionate explanation, Lee Chang-jin recalled the contents of the notebook he had seen earlier.

Thanks to the selective breeding program that started in the U.S. in the 1940s, poultry productivity increased significantly.

As a result, improved breeds of chickens emerged, leading to the current broiler chickens. With increased productivity in laying hens, both egg and chicken production and consumption have been on the rise. The number of chickens raised in Korea surged from 720,000 right after liberation to 23 million by 1973.

“Chicken production varies by country. In the U.S. and Europe, people prefer breast meat, while in Asia, leg and thigh meat is more popular. Because preferences vary by region, the prices for different parts can vary, which is advantageous for exports.”

“Haha, I understand. Thank you for the insightful information. It’s still too early for a serious discussion, but I’ll consider it positively when the time comes.”

As they were parting ways after the meal, Deok-gu bowed his head and said,

“Thanks for the meal, Mr. Lee. I know you’re busy, so thank you for taking the time.”

“No, it was a beneficial time for me as well.”

On the way back, Dong-geun spoke hesitantly.

“I’m sorry, hyungnim. Deok-gu hyung talks a lot about business when he drinks… He’s not a bad person, so I hope you weren’t too offended.”

“No, I liked that he has clear dreams. Actually, Dong-geun, don’t you have similar thoughts?”

“Well, yes, but it’s still far off. I need to save up capital first. I can’t just dive in without any preparation.”

“I noticed you’ve been preparing quite diligently. I didn’t realize you were working so hard behind the scenes.”

“No way… I still have a long way to go. Compared to you, I’m just a firefly next to the moon.”

“No, you’re doing great. By the way, when are the results of the chick sexing exam coming out?”

“About two weeks from now.”

“That’s perfect then. It might be tight, but how about drafting a business plan by then? If it’s viable, I might consider investing.”

Dong-geun’s eyes widened in surprise.

“Really, hyungnim? Are you serious?”

“Haha, have you ever seen me make empty promises? But let’s discuss it after you pass the sexing exam. Prepare thoroughly as if you’re briefing an investor. If the plan is sloppy, I’ll reject it immediately, so don’t slack off.”

“Of course, hyungnim. I’ll give it my best.”

As soon as he got out of the car, Dong-geun hurried to his room, causing Lee Chang-jin to chuckle.

“When did he grow up so much?”

After changing clothes, he saw that it was 7:30. He suddenly remembered someone he had forgotten about.

“Oh no, I forgot to call…”

Lee Chang-jin dialed Jin Seon-ah’s number.

After a few rings, a familiar voice answered.

“You finally called, Mr. Lee Chang-jin. How was your trip to Germany?”

Her slightly prickly tone made Lee Chang-jin smile as he replied,

“Yes, it went well, thanks to you. Seon-ah, it’s a bit late, but can you come out for a bit?”

“Now? Where to?”

“Hmm, how about the park behind the Board of Audit and Inspection in Samcheong-dong? How about in an hour?”

“Samcheong Park? Hmm… it’s a bit late…”

“Oh, I see… Shall we meet some other time then?”

“No, no, it’s fine. I’ll see you then.”

“Alright, let’s meet at 8:30 at the entrance to Samcheong Park.”

After hanging up, Lee Chang-jin took a shower and prepared his clothes, while Jin Seon-ah was bustling around.

“Oh my, what should I do… He finally called.”

“Who?”

“Chang-jin. Oh my, I haven’t even showered yet…”

“Chang-jin? The one who lent you money?”

“Yes, that’s right. Auntie, I have an appointment at 8:30. What should I wear?”

Jin Seon-ah, standing in front of her full-length mirror, held up different outfits for comparison, making the housekeeper laugh.

Her usual cool demeanor was gone, replaced by excitement. The housekeeper quickly calmed her down.

“Alright, miss, don’t get too excited. You still have plenty of time. First, wash your face. We need to do your makeup.”

“Oh, right, makeup. And my hair, it’s all flat.”

“Don’t worry. You’re naturally beautiful. Men like straight hair too. I’ll pick out your outfit, so go wash up.”

“Okay. I’ll leave it to you.”

After a quick shower, Jin Seon-ah sat down, and the housekeeper carefully did her makeup. Jin Seon-ah chatted non-stop during the process.

“It’s been a while since I’ve seen him. What should I say? I have no idea.”

“Don’t be too anxious. Just be yourself. Ask him about his trip to Germany. But don’t bombard him with too many questions; he might be tired.”

“Got it. I’ll remember that. Anything else I should be careful about?”

The housekeeper, while working on her makeup, playfully pinched her cheek.

“There’s a lot to be careful about. Don’t be too obvious with your excitement. Men don’t feed caught fish. There, it’s done. I gave your eyes a highlight since it’s evening.”

Her eyes, highlighted with pigment, looked even more captivating. Jin Seon-ah checked herself in a hand mirror and nodded in satisfaction.

“Thank you. Your skills are the best, as always.”

Wearing a purple tank dress and a gold bracelet, she looked radiant. The housekeeper, after giving her a light kiss on the cheek, reminded her again.

“Have a great time, miss. Don’t follow him anywhere strange. Remember, all men are wolves. Be cautious.”

“Got it, auntie. I’ll be careful.”

With her preparations complete, Jin Seon-ah headed to Samcheong-dong.

Driving past Gyeongbokgung and up a mountain road for about 2 kilometers brought her to a park nestled under a dense forest. Known among couples as a dating spot, it was a well-kept secret.

Arriving just in time, Jin Seon-ah stepped out of her car and saw Lee Chang-jin waiting under a dim streetlight, dressed in jeans and a light blue linen shirt.
