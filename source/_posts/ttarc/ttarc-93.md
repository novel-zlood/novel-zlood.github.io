## Episode 93: VIP's Interests

Nam Tae-hoon, who entered the headquarters of Taeyang Construction, encountered an unexpected obstacle.

"What? Too busy to meet me?"

"Yes. Due to work commitments, he has a meeting scheduled today and can't see you."

"That's nonsense. Busy with what? Didn't you hear me say it's urgent?"

"It would be best to arrange another time..."

"Ha! Ridiculous. Move aside!"

Security personnel who were dispatched due to Nam Tae-hoon's commotion blocked his way.

"Mr. Nam, you can't just go in there."

"Let go, you punk. Touch me, and you're dead."

Nam Tae-hoon, who forcefully pushed his way in, opened the door to the president's office without knocking.

Nam Tae-kyung, engrossed in documents, didn't even look up at Nam Tae-hoon who barged in and sat down on the sofa as if it were his own house.

"Hyung! I'm here! You could at least show your face. What could be so busy?"

Nam Tae-kyung responded without even lifting his head.

"Didn't you hear I have a prior engagement today?"

"Oh, I heard. But I have urgent business too. Isn't it customary to at least offer tea when a younger brother visits? Hey, Secretary Kim. Bring some coffee."

The secretary, flustered by Nam Tae-hoon's audacious command, looked troubled as she spoke.

"Mr. Nam, you can't do this. The president is still in the middle of work..."

"Shut up and get the coffee. Hey, lady, are your ears blocked?"

The secretary, not knowing what to do, looked to Nam Tae-kyung for help.

Nam Tae-kyung, annoyed by the rude behavior, raised an eyebrow.

"What kind of nonsense is this?"

"Hyung acts like he doesn't want to see me, so I have to force my way in. I won't leave until we finish our conversation."

"Stop this nonsense. If you don't leave on your own, I can have you forcibly removed."

Nam Tae-kyung, irritated, was about to call security.

Then Nam Tae-hoon warned him.

"Hyung, this isn't fun. Did you forget I own shares in Taeyang Group too? If you disregard me like this, I'll go to Nam Joo-hee."

"What?"

"I mean I'll switch sides. Or I could go to Tae-hee. He'd welcome me with open arms."

Nam Tae-hee, the second son of Chairman Nam Tae-gon of Taeyang Group, was currently studying M&A at Harvard Business School in the U.S. He was the most academically inclined among the Nam family, and Chairman Nam Tae-gon had high expectations for him.

From Nam Tae-kyung's perspective, he was a thorn in his side and his biggest competitor.

It was natural for Nam Tae-kyung's expression to darken upon hearing this.

"Are you threatening me?"

"Oh, what ability do I have to threaten you, hyung? Even if I'm far from being a successor, I can still throw a wrench in the works. Until you take the throne, you're just a prince like me, not a king."

Nam Tae-kyung glared at him. Though Nam Tae-hoon had been shunned for his reckless behavior, he was still a legitimate member of the Nam family and had shares to inherit, making him not easily dismissible. Nam Tae-kyung asked, still displeased.

"So, what do you want?"

"Hyung, lend me some land for the construction company's factory. The site planned for the Juan Industrial Complex."

"What do you need that for?"

"There's a guy who invaded my turf. I can't let him go unchecked, can I? I heard he's had some issues with you too. It's Lee Chang-jin of Daese Industries."

Nam Tae-kyung's face stiffened momentarily.

Lee Chang-jin was the one who had made him lie low for a while after he lost Taeyang Trading to Nam Joo-hee. Because of him, Nam Tae-kyung had to live quietly for some time.

Nam Tae-kyung, whose interest was piqued, subtly probed Nam Tae-hoon.

"If I lend you the land, can you beat him?"

"Hyung, don't you know me? I'm Nam Tae-hoon, the mad dog. I don't let anyone mess with my bowl."

Nam Tae-kyung, showing interest, and Nam Tae-hoon, not avoiding his gaze.

During the tense silence, Nam Tae-kyung's face remained expressionless.

However, his mind was racing.

'Who knows? This guy might actually hit him hard. If that happens, I can achieve my goal without lifting a finger.'

Even if Nam Tae-hoon failed, he could still cause enough trouble.

Nam Tae-kyung hated seeing Lee Chang-jin get anything easily.

Nam Tae-kyung, his voice softened, spoke as if doing a favor.

"Just this once. Mention Tae-hee or Joo-hee again, and you're really out."

Turning his chair back around, Nam Tae-kyung dismissed him.

Nam Tae-hoon, smiling broadly, finally showed respect and bowed 90 degrees.

"Hyung! I'm deeply grateful. I won't forget this favor."

A few days later, a prominent column appeared in the morning edition of the Hansung Daily.

"Is the Invasion of Harmful Polluting Industries into Korea Justified?"

"Recently, there's been talk of a titanium dioxide plant being built in the Bupyeong area, abandoned by the U.S. military. This has sparked controversy. Seo In-chul, who has lived in Bupyeong for nearly half a century, said:

'While some people liked having a U.S. military base nearby, it had many downsides. During training, it was chaos, with constant gunfire day and night. We could barely live. Now that the Americans have left, we can finally live peacefully, but now they're bringing in a chemical plant? Over my dead body.'

There are reasons for opposing the titanium dioxide plant in Bupyeong. Titanium dioxide is commonly used in food and paint as a white pigment. However, titanium tetrachloride, used in its initial processing, is a Class 1 carcinogen that causes lung disease.

As a result, the DuPont Edgemoor plant in England had a major leak earlier this year, requiring emergency treatment for 22 residents, with frequent leak-related incidents worldwide.

The increased burden of polluting industries on residents' survival rights is our current reality.

- Reporter Seo Chang-ho"

Reading the column that seemed to target Lee Chang-jin, Gu Chang-dong crumpled the newspaper in anger.

"What kind of scummy people are these? Using hired goons to stir things up."

"For Hansung Daily to get involved, it's clear Taeyang Group pulled some strings."

But the real problem came next. Yeo Jin-joo rushed in with shocking news.

"Big trouble. Taeyang Chemical has submitted an application to expand their factory at the Juan Industrial Complex!"

The employees were shocked and murmured among themselves.

"Is that true?"

Manager Seo sighed in frustration.

"How dirty. I thought this would be easy... This is tough."

The atmosphere in the office sank instantly.

Gu Chang-dong, not grasping the situation, cautiously asked Manager Seo, who was smoking a cigarette.

"What does Taeyang's application have to do with us?"

"You idiot, don't you get it? According to the government's industrial rationalization policy, only one chemical plant like a titanium dioxide plant can be established in a given area. If Taeyang Chemical's application is approved, our factory plan is dead."

Finally understanding, Manager Gu Chang-dong looked panicked.

"What? Then what do we do?"

"We have to block it at all costs. If it passes, we're screwed."

Lee Chang-jin and his team entered an emergency meeting.

After reviewing the report, Manager Seo spoke knowingly.

"These guys are bluffing 100%. It's a joke. They must have submitted a plan in a hurry."

"Well, once the establishment permit is passed, whether they build the factory or not is a later matter. They just need to block our factory. It's their scheme."

Consultant Hong In-young was also outraged by Taeyang's tactics.

But the problem was proving it.

Lee Chang-jin calmed the agitated staff.

"Everyone, cool down. We anticipated some obstacles from the start. Since they used the media, we should retaliate. Contact reporter Joo Young-mi."

With the opponent opening fire first, it was time for a counterattack.

Lee Chang-jin conducted an exclusive interview with Joo Young-mi from Kyungwoon Daily.

"This is clearly a move by Taeyang Chemical to block us. A large corporation with monopoly power is trying to nip its competition in the bud."

Kyungwoon Daily focused on the connections between Nam Tae-hoon and Taeyang Group.

Lee Chang-jin also commissioned cartoonist Choo Sung-woon to draw a cartoon depicting a big kid, representing Taeyang Group, bullying a smaller kid with a Daese Industries name tag and stealing his candy.

With Kyungwoon Daily's focused coverage, the issue shifted from the harmfulness of the titanium dioxide process to a battle between a small company and a large corporation.

As the issue grew, it reached the Blue House. The President, reading the morning paper, called Chief Secretary Won to inquire.

"Why is the economic section so noisy these days? The same articles have been coming out for three days. Is a chemical plant such a big deal?"

"Two companies are competing to build a factory in the same area. Taeyang Groupâ€™s involvement has escalated the issue with the media stoking the fire."

"A large corporation like Taeyang Group is involved. Is titanium dioxide that important?"

"It's a highly valuable chemical pigment. I hear the byproducts from processing are also quite profitable. It's a growing market globally. The byproducts are also strategic materials used in special processing like ingots."

"Then why not approve both factories?"

"That would lead to oversupply and market disorder due to excessive competition. Both are in the Seoul metropolitan area, raising air pollution concerns."

"That's unfortunate. Handle it fairly to avoid controversy. In times like these, any talk of favoritism would be bad for public opinion."

"Understood. I will handle it as instructed."

Hearing that the President took an interest, the Ministry of Commerce was on edge.

Amid rising labor disputes, a directive from above had come.

For Nam Tae-hoon, who was hoping for a lucky break, this was bad news.

"What? They're changing the review committee now?"

"The VIP ordered it to be handled fairly to avoid any noise. Chief Secretary Won is personally overseeing it. It looks like there will be a major reshuffle of the existing committee members."

"Damn it. What were the guys I paid off doing? I spent a fortune to prevent this! Are they just going to take the money and run?"

Nam Tae-hoon, rolling up his sleeves and ready to rush out, was restrained by his secretaries.

"Sir, calm down. There's nothing we can do this time."

"Damn it!!!"

Chief Secretary Won was a man who wouldn't blink at pressure from a conglomerate like Taeyang Group.

Not only was his family formidable, but he also had supporters across various sectors, making him a tough target.

Moreover, as a trusted advisor managing economic policies, with the President's strong backing and a no-compromise attitude, any rash action could backfire.

While Nam Tae-hoon was frustrated, for Lee Chang-jin, it was a chance for a turnaround.
