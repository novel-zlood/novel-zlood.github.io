## Episode 128: The Master’s Gift

"Come this way."

Leaving the porters behind, Lee Chang-jin and Jin Tae-chun walked side by side along a trail. The ground was soft with humus, feeling pleasant underfoot. Fallen leaves from last autumn had been transformed by rain and frost.

Camellia and bamboo trees formed a tunnel with their unique harmony. After resting briefly on a flat area, they climbed a hill and arrived at a cactus garden. The garden was filled with various sizes of cacti, surrounded by banana and ash trees, as well as laurel trees, which were rarely seen.

"Amazing. It feels like we are in a different place."

"This used to be a branch of an elementary school that closed down due to a lack of students. It was used as a warehouse, but we tore it down and renovated it."

A few steps further, they were greeted by a century plant, known to bloom once in a hundred years. Though the climb was a bit steep, the fresh air seemed to energize them.

Following the path, they soon arrived at their destination.

"Here we are!"

The secluded villa had an outdoor garden and a swimming pool for parties. In the living room stood a lush palm tree, and lounge chairs made of rattan were visible. Beyond that, there was a luxury house with pastel-colored walls and a triangular roof with a chimney.

"It's the Hamptons style."

"Oh, you know it well. Have you spent some time in America?"

"I visited during an overseas training program."

The warm weather with the sea breeze, and the beautiful coastal scenery, perfectly captured the vibe of Long Island, a playground for the upper class.

In front of the two or three-story house stood life-sized lion statues, and the railings and multiple chimneys evoked a scene from a fairy tale.

The interior, blending gray and brown tones, was filled with antiques. The old stone walls and ochre-colored flooring added a country feel. The fireplace in the middle of the living room provided a warm ambiance, and the rustic wooden table added to the coziness.

Upon entering, an elderly butler greeted them politely.

"Welcome, Chairman."

"It's been a while, Butler Kim. Is everything ready?"

"Fortunately, you arrived just in time. The baby goat roast is almost done."

"That's great. I also brought some fish. I’m looking forward to your skills."

The man smiled knowingly as he inspected the fish in the net.

"The quality is excellent. I will start the preparations immediately."

"Thank you. I'll take a shower, so you should also wash up quickly. The bathroom is on the right."

After finishing his bath, Lee Chang-jin came out feeling refreshed.

Jin Tae-chun, also freshly showered, was looking around while holding a wine glass.

"The maintenance here is impeccable. Have you been here long?"

"He’s an old acquaintance who manages the villa. After being shipwrecked and stranded, he fell in love with this island and decided to settle here. He's a jack-of-all-trades, handling cooking, landscaping, carpentry, and house management."

In the middle of the living room hung a watercolor painting reminiscent of the seaside. It depicted a man in a sailor's outfit shucking a clam. On closer inspection, the man resembled Jin Tae-chun.

Jin Tae-chun spoke up.

"My wife painted this."

"She’s very talented."

"My wife used to visit here often. Seon-ah has been here a few times too, but she gets severe seasickness, so we couldn't bring her often. My wife stayed here for her health and learned painting out of boredom."

As they chatted, the butler announced politely that the meal was ready.

On the rustic wooden table was a Spanish-style baby goat roast seasoned with olive oil, oregano, and a bit of salt. It had been slow-roasted for four hours over a low flame.

Other dishes, including thinly sliced scallops and a savory soup, were prepared appetizingly.

Behind the villa was a cliffside, offering an open view of the sea. The untouched camellia forest on the rugged cliffs created a mysterious atmosphere.

As the spicy fish stew was brought out, Jin Tae-chun, watching the slowly setting sun, asked:

"Does it suit your taste?"

"It's excellent. Especially this goat roast. The lean rib meat practically melts in your mouth."

"I'm glad. Our Butler Kim still has his touch. I should give him a raise. By the way, how long have you been seeing each other?"

"It's been about five years."

"Already? You've been together a long time. You've had enough time for romance. When are you planning to marry our Seon-ah? Love is good, but don’t let the good times pass by."

"I was thinking of bringing it up to Seon-ah soon."

"Don't drag it out. Even if you two are fine, think about this old man. It's lonely in my old age; I want to at least enjoy the joy of having grandchildren. Are you going to let me die without seeing our Seon-ah get married?"

"I'm sorry about that."

"Set a wedding date soon. Seon-ah’s getting older and occasionally throws tantrums. Honestly, from a woman's perspective, it's not easy to bring up marriage. It's something the man should initiate. Get engaged early next year and get married quickly."

"Understood. I’ll follow your advice."

"Haha, I like your decisiveness in these matters. So, how do you like this place? Do you like it?"

"Of course. This place with such beautiful scenery feels like heaven. It’s too good to keep to oneself. It would be wonderful to develop it into a tourist resort."

"You want to develop this island?"

"Yes. As the economy grows, entertainment options are needed. Now is the perfect time to develop it, especially since overseas travel is restricted. With some landscaping and a bit of harbor expansion, we could attract over two million visitors annually."

"Haha, that’s quite an idea. A resort development, you do have an eye for things."

Lee Chang-jin briefly explained how he envisioned developing the island. He already had a detailed plan in his mind, knowing that the area would eventually turn into a tourist hotspot.

Listening attentively, Jin Tae-chun finally burst into laughter.

"Excellent! You’ve put a lot of thought into this. Then this island is yours."

"What?"

"In fact, the entire island is my property. I bought it from the residents a while back. Consider it an early engagement gift."

"Father, no matter how much, this is..."

"Hey, aren’t you going to be my son-in-law? You deserve at least this much."

"Father, I'm fine."

"No more words. Just accept it. I believe you can take better care of this island than I can. I never thought of developing the island until you mentioned it. It's only right for someone who sees its value to have it. Develop it as you see fit."

Lee Chang-jin repeatedly declined, but he couldn't resist Jin Tae-chun's insistence.

"Thank you, Father."

"If you are grateful, set the engagement date soon. I want to hear the sound of grandchildren playing. Nam Tae-gon keeps bragging about his, it's annoying."

"Yes, I will hurry."

Jin Tae-chun spoke to Lee Chang-jin with satisfaction.

"Oh, and take the yacht. You’ll need a boat to come and go from the island."

"Father, the island alone is too much, and now a yacht too?"

"Listen, when an elder gives you something, you take it. Besides, it’s not free. It’s on the condition that you manage the new financial company. I’ve ordered a new one, so I’ll use that. Nam Tae-gon keeps borrowing it, and I’m sick of it. If I give it to my son-in-law, he won’t ask to borrow it anymore."

Though Lee Chang-jin tried to decline several times, Jin Tae-chun was stubborn. Waving the yacht key, Jin Tae-chun insisted.

"Are you going to keep being stubborn? My arm hurts. This old man's arm is going to fall off."

Lee Chang-jin had no choice but to accept the key.

"Then I’ll gratefully accept it."

"Good. Take good care of the crew here. They are people I’ve known for a long time."

"Of course. I will do as you wish, Father."

"Hey, Butler Kim, our son-in-law is now your boss. Assist him well."

Starting the next day, Lee Chang-jin and Jin Tae-chun thoroughly explored the island, getting to know its geography and resources. It took just three days to tour the island, which had about 20 households. Returning to Seoul, Lee Chang-jin and Jin Seon-ah set their engagement date.

Jin Seon-ah, having waited quite a while, was delighted.

Not long after, Lee Chang-jin, back in his daily routine, was met with news of the collapse of the Pahlavi dynasty.

January 26, 1979, 『Gyung-Un Daily』.

"Iranian Shah Pahlavi Abdicates, New Government Formation Imminent"

[As anti-government protests in Iran intensified, Shah Pahlavi, succumbing to pressure, decided to abdicate and go into exile. This marks the end of the Pahlavi reign that had been plagued by violent protests throughout the past year.

A week later, on February 1, the religious leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, ended his 16 years of exile and returned home to a hero’s welcome. The Pahlavi dynasty, which began in 1925 following Reza Khan's coup in 1921, closed its doors after 74 years.

The Islamic Revolution emerged as a natural response to the Shah's lack of communication and the anti-American sentiment in the Islamic world. Iran's modernization policies, which began with the White Revolution in 1963, were dealt a severe blow, shaking the global economy once again.

The political instability in Iran led to a complete halt in oil exports, amounting to 5 million barrels per day. Additionally, as major advanced nations such as the U.S. and Japan increased their stockpiling in anticipation of a second oil shock, international oil prices began to surge.

- Reporter Joo Young-mi]

Reading the morning newspaper, Manager Gu Chang-dong clicked his tongue.

"The world is in turmoil. Vietnam has invaded Cambodia and surrounded the capital. It seems like the world has gone mad."

"In times when only good things should happen, chaos is everywhere."

In response to Seo Yohan's comment, Advisor Hong In-young, who had recently returned to Korea, chimed in.

"Luckily, we pre-purchased the necessary oil and construction materials. The shipping industry is in a state of emergency, and transportation costs for materials have nearly doubled. Our work in the Middle East is almost finished, with only the final stages left. It could have been a huge loss otherwise."

Meanwhile, even in Korea, which had experienced the oil shock, there was a sudden craze for hoarding due to skyrocketing kerosene prices. Electricity bills were also showing signs of a steep increase. In January, the spot price of international crude oil, based on Rotterdam, had soared from $13.34 to $18, a 1.5 times increase.

Lee Chang-jin did some quick calculations with his fingers.

"Let's see, after deducting taxes and other expenses, did we make about 10 billion won in pure profit?"

The oil payments, made with promissory notes due in three months, amounted to 5 billion won worth of oil. It had been a lucrative deal for Lee Chang-jin. Given the steep decline in the dollar, the foreign exchange gains were also substantial.
