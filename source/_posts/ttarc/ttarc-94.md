## Episode 94: Daese vs. Taeyang

Upon hearing the news from Manager Seong Gong-cheol, Lee Chang-jin knew that this was the moment to make a decisive move.

"Thank you for informing me about His Excellency’s remarks. When is the review scheduled?"

"It’s set for two weeks from now, President Lee. We need to prepare the presentation materials by then."

As the issue gained attention, the Incheon City Review Committee decided to treat this evaluation like a bidding process and notified both companies of the review criteria.

The evaluation criteria were divided into four main categories:

1. Economic feasibility review related to factory establishment approval (30 points)
2. Compliance with technical standards related to construction (25 points)
3. Safety review (25 points)
4. Environmental impact assessment and social contribution factors (20 points)

The total score would be determined based on these criteria.

After thoroughly reviewing the documents from the review committee, Consultant Hong In-young commented:

"Given the time constraints, Taeyang Chemicals likely submitted their existing business plan based on the sulfuric acid process. They probably didn’t have the time to create new blueprints."

Hearing this, Gu Chang-dong brightened up.

"Then we have an advantage, don’t we? Our process is more modern than theirs."

"Not necessarily. We are at a significant disadvantage in the economic feasibility part. Taeyang Chemicals has strong financial health. The same goes for technical standards. They have more professional technicians, and frankly, they are in a different league compared to us."

Taeyang Chemicals was a solid company with a capital of 30 billion won. Moreover, as a subsidiary of the Taeyang Group, they had an overwhelming financial advantage. This prompted Manager Lee Chang-sik to ask a question.

"We have an edge in environmental and safety aspects, don’t we? The chlorine process, which doesn’t emit sulfuric acid, is more environmentally friendly than the sulfuric acid process."

"That’s true, but the financial scoring is much higher, making it difficult to overturn."

Seeing the simulation results showing a narrow defeat, Lee Chang-jin and his team brainstormed for a winning strategy.

"We need a groundbreaking solution. We can’t guarantee victory with our current approach."

"Don’t worry. As long as the review is fair, we have plenty of ways to win. Let’s take a closer look at the process improvement plans."

Lee Chang-jin and the Daese Industries research team worked through several nights to prepare the presentation.

As the review date was set, the newly appointed review committee members gathered at Bupyeong District Office.

Considering the high level of interest in the matter, reporters were scattered around the entrance even before the arrival.

As Lee Chang-jin’s GM Record vehicle glided in, reporters quickly approached with their microphones.

"Mr. Lee Chang-jin, you’re competing with Taeyang Chemicals for the factory establishment approval. What are your thoughts on the overlapping approval situation?"

Lee Chang-jin, prepared with his responses, answered:

"I regret this situation, but as a business operator, I believe we can’t avoid competition. We have prepared diligently for the given circumstances."

"Does that mean you are confident in obtaining the factory establishment approval?"

"Of course. I believe the review committee will conduct the review process fairly. If it’s a fair review, I see no reason why our business plan should be rejected. We will do our best and accept whatever results come."

As Lee Chang-jin calmly answered the questions during the interview, a commotion arose from somewhere.

Click! Click!

On the opposite side of Lee Chang-jin, Nam Tae-hoon, the representative of Taeyang Chemicals, appeared.

As Nam Tae-hoon stepped out of his black Benz and raised his head, the cameras of the reporters all turned towards him.

Click! Click!

Like fish in water, the reporters rushed towards him.

Nam Tae-hoon, the fourth son of Taeyang Group and once notorious for various scandals, drew significant attention from the reporters.

Thirsty for exclusives, the reporters held out their microphones.

"Mr. Nam, could you say a few words? Was the application for the chemical plant expansion planned from the beginning?"

"There’s a lot of talk about killing small businesses. What do you think about announcing the expansion plan at this timing?"

Nam Tae-hoon answered with a relaxed smile to Reporter Joo Young-mi’s question:

"That’s a coincidence. The plant expansion has been seriously discussed for several years due to the increase in domestic demand."

"So, you’re saying it wasn’t intended to exert external pressure?"

"I don’t think it’s my place to answer that. I believe it’s better to let the results speak for themselves. I also plan to fully comply with the committee’s decision."

However, Joo Young-mi persisted.

"What will you do if the expansion application is rejected?"

"I haven’t thought that far. We at Taeyang have never considered the possibility of the approval being denied."

"So, Daese Chemicals is not a threat to Taeyang Chemicals?"

"Yes, considering our operational experience and performance, it’s only natural for us to obtain the approval. The results will prove everything, so let’s discuss further after the review."

Nam Tae-hoon ended his remarks and started walking away, while the reporters persistently followed him.

"Mr. Nam Tae-hoon!"

"Just one more comment, Mr. Nam Tae-hoon."

As Nam Tae-hoon entered the building, security guards blocked the reporters.

"From here on, it’s under the jurisdiction of the city council review. You can’t go any further."

With the security guards maintaining strong security, the door slammed shut.

As the reporters disappeared from sight, Nam Tae-hoon’s expression instantly changed, revealing a nervous demeanor.

He took out a handkerchief, wiped his hands, and muttered irritably.

"Leeches. They’re always looking for a scoop."

"Reporters are always like that. They’re obsessed with issues."

"By the way, what’s the name of that female reporter who was pestering me earlier? The pretty one."

"Reporter Joo Young-mi from Gyeongun Daily."

"Where’s she from?"

"She’s a graduate of Seonggwang University."

Nam Tae-hoon sneered.

"Seonggwang University? Where’s that even located?"

"It’s a national university in Busan. I heard she attended on a full scholarship."

"She’s rude. As expected, she has no background. Give a check to the other reporters. Ask them to take care of the articles."

"Yes, I’ll do as you say."

At that moment, Lee Chang-jin, who had just finished his interview, approached Nam Tae-hoon.

"What do you want?"

Despite Nam Tae-hoon’s hostile gaze, Lee Chang-jin greeted him politely.

"Hello, Mr. Nam Tae-hoon. I’m Lee Chang-jin from Daese Industries."

Nam Tae-hoon looked down at the hand extended for a handshake, but responded with sarcasm instead.

"So you’re Lee Chang-jin. Where did you learn to stick your spoon in someone else’s bowl?"

Manager Gu Chang-dong, accompanying Lee Chang-jin, was outraged by his rude behavior.

"Don’t you have any manners? How dare you..."

As the angry Gu Chang-dong stepped forward, security guards blocked him.

Lee Chang-jin stopped Manager Gu with his hand and replied.

"Haha, sticking a spoon in someone else’s bowl? Anyone would think you’re the one who put the food there. In business, there’s no such thing as yours or mine. The first one to sell wins."

"What? Well, those with no background are all the same. People from humble origins don’t know their place."

"Well, it seems you’re not much different, Mr. Nam Tae-hoon. You’re infamous for being a spoiled brat who’s already been eliminated from the succession race."

Nam Tae-hoon raised his eyebrows at this remark.

"What? Are you picking a fight with me? How dare a lowly person like you act up just because you’ve made some money?"

"Well, your family doesn’t seem that great either. Isn’t your family known for cleaning up after the Japanese during the colonial period? Boasting about your background doesn’t seem like something to be proud of. Don’t you think so, Minami-san?"

Nam Tae-hoon glared at him with murderous intent.

"You... How dare you say such nonsense...!"

Nam Tae-hoon’s great-grandfather, Nam Tae-hyung, was a prominent pro-Japanese figure who served as a councilor during the Japanese colonial period and even changed his name during World War II. Although his grandfather, Nam Tae-yang, managed to keep his name off the pro-Japanese list, it was a well-known dark history of the Taeyang Group for anyone with a bit of historical knowledge.

With his face flushed and fists clenched, Nam Tae-hoon’s bodyguard whispered worriedly.

"Please calm down. There are too many eyes watching."

Nam Tae-hoon’s lips twitched with anger.

"Watch your mouth. You’ll get seriously hurt because of it."

"Thanks for the warning. You should watch your lower half. Don’t end up in jail again for fooling around."

Nam Tae-hoon turned his head sharply.

Watching Nam Tae-hoon’s back, Manager Gu grumbled.

"He’s incredibly annoying. Are all chaebols that rude?"

"No, it’s just his family. Not all of them are like that."

For Lee Chang-jin, who had lost his company due to the Taeyang Group in a past life, it was strange not to hold a grudge. As he was composing himself, a female employee in a suit approached him.

"Mr. Lee Chang-jin, Mr. Nam Tae-hoon. Please come in."

Was the review finally starting?

Lee Chang-jin took a deep breath and entered the conference room.

The conference room was about 70 pyeong (approximately 231.4 square meters) in size, quite spacious.

Director Lee Chul-song, newly appointed for this review, was seated at the head of the table.

Director Lee Chul-song, a traditional bureaucrat who passed the 14th Administrative Examination, had worked in the Ministry of Commerce for nearly 28 years, starting in the import-export department.

From Lee Chang-jin’s memory, he would later serve as the Minister of Commerce and the Chairman of the Board of Audit and Inspection.

‘It seems Chief Won has put in quite an effort.’

Seeing the lineup, Lee Chang-jin felt grateful. Director Lee Chul-song was a renowned bureaucrat known for his integrity.

With the possibility of favoritism reduced, his tension eased, and he felt more relaxed.

As everyone took their seats, Director Lee Chul-song made an opening remark before the review.

"Despite your busy schedules, I sincerely thank the committee members for attending the meeting for the development of construction technology in Incheon. Today’s review will primarily focus on the establishment of a titanium dioxide plant. Daese Chemicals and Taeyang Chemicals will each have about 10 minutes to present their plans, and the total score will be determined based on these presentations. I ask for the active cooperation of the committee members to ensure a smooth and thorough review today. With that, I declare the start of the 192nd Incheon City Construction Technology Review of 1977."

Bang! Bang! Bang!

With the sound of the gavel, the review for the chemical plant began.
