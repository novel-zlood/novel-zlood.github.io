## Episode 90: The Fearsome Investor

"Look at this, look at this. It's a business plan. Why did you say there wasn't one? You should have reported this promptly. What's going on?"

"Oh, this is a draft plan for establishing a chemical plant made after returning from Mexico."

"You're making me feel betrayed. Why hide something like this? Were you planning to build it without me?"

"It's not finished yet, so I had no intention of hiding it. I planned to discuss it once the plan was complete, but I thought we could just chat lightly today."

"Then, stop talking and show me. Let me take a look."

Jin Seon-ah meticulously examined the documents and spoke seriously.

"Hmm, a titanium dioxide plant. Even without the blueprints, the market potential looks promising. Do you have buyers lined up for when it's completed?"

"The domestic market is chronically undersupplied, so finding clients shouldn't be difficult. Even just supplying food companies or paint companies should cover the costs."

"If you process the intermediate product, titanium tetrachloride, you'll get by-products in addition to titanium dioxide. What's the expected profit margin?"

"At least a profit of $0.7 per ton. Even after deducting royalties and taxes, the annual operating profit should be between 3 billion and 5 billion won. However, the initial investment is substantial. Firstly, around 1 billion won, with an additional 3 billion won needed for factory site contracts, equipment purchases, permits, and construction."

Jin Seon-ah's eyes glittered sharply as she focused on the documents.

"A total of 4 billion won, that's a significant amount. It's too large for personal capital. You'd need investors, wouldn't you?"

"I am planning to gather small investors. That's also why I'm creating this business plan."

"Then, Chang-jin, let me invest in this project too. Oh, don't misunderstand, it's not under Daese Industries' name, but as an individual."

"As an individual, Seon-ah?"

"What? Are you looking down on me? I have ample funds. Moreover, there are many wealthy women around me who are eager to find investment opportunities. With these conditions, they'd probably go crazy over it. I'll try to bring in about 3 billion won, with 1 billion of my own money. Just make sure I get a good share."

"In that case, I can guarantee a minimum of 10%. If you invest 2 billion won, I can offer up to 20%."

"That's too little."

At her words, Lee Chang-jin shrugged his shoulders.

"Well, it will become a cash cow that keeps generating money. From a medium- to long-term perspective, there isn't a more profitable business. Besides, I'm the one taking the operational risks, am I not? It's not like I have any regrets..."

Jin Seon-ah stuck out her tongue and shook her head.

"You're a real businessman at times like this. Well, that's part of your charm, Chang-jin."

"Haha. Thank you."

Jin Seon-ah, who had been looking at the documents again, asked a question.

"How about making this company a joint-stock company?"

"A joint-stock company?"

"Yes. It's better to plan for an initial public offering (IPO) from the start. Once the company is on track, you can aim for a backdoor listing. It should take roughly 3 to 5 years."

"A backdoor listing..."

"Yes. Daese Industries can play the role of a holding company."

"Hmm. I hadn't thought about it that far, but it seems like a good idea."

To grow a company, a lot of capital is needed. While there were no issues now, considering future expansions and mergers and acquisitions, it was wise to plan ahead.

Excited, Jin Seon-ah and Lee Chang-jin continued their business talk and secured an investment commitment on the spot.

Suddenly curious, Lee Chang-jin asked her.

"But, is it alright to make investment decisions so hastily? As you saw in the proposal, there are still many incomplete points."

"I'm not well-versed in the detailed aspects of investment projects. I just look at the outline. It's not because of the proposal; I'm investing because I trust you, Chang-jin."

"Seon-ah, I can't guarantee success every time. You need to think carefully."

"My father always said that private lenders invest in people, not items. I believe in you, Chang-jin. Sometimes it feels like you can see the future."

To Jin Seon-ah, Lee Chang-jin seemed like someone blessed with business luck.

He succeeded in everything he touched, so perhaps it was only natural.

Embarrassed by Jin Seon-ah's praise, Lee Chang-jin felt a tingling at the back of his head.

"I feel dizzy from all the flattery. It's a bit embarrassing to hear such words right in front of me."

"Hmm. What's wrong? Should I withdraw my offer?"

"Hey, I'm just joking."

"Then let's end the business talk here and go for a walk."

The two finished their conversation and stepped outside again. Dusk had fallen, and the clock pointed to 6 PM. As the sunset illuminated the tree-lined street, the autumn leaves glowed golden, like a scene from a movie transferred to a watercolor painting.

"Wow, it's so beautiful."

Looking at the sunset, Jin Seon-ah transformed into a sentimental girl.

Lee Chang-jin watched her with satisfaction as she gazed at the sunset for a long time.

After a while, she shivered, perhaps feeling the chill of the autumn breeze.

"It's suddenly cold."

"Indeed, the temperature difference is quite noticeable."

Jin Seon-ah huddled her shoulders, trying to avoid the strong wind.

Lee Chang-jin naturally opened his coat and wrapped something around her neck.

The warm and soft sensation made Jin Seon-ah's pupils dilate.

"What is this?"

"It's a gift. It's going to get colder, so wear this."

It was a purple rebozo (a type of scarf) he had brought separately from Mexico. Made of silk, it felt very soft and had a subtle fragrance, as if it had been dipped in perfume.

Blushing, Jin Seon-ah murmured softly.

"Thank you."

"It suits you well. I'm glad I chose carefully."

Unexpectedly receiving a gift, Jin Seon-ah's face turned red.

In fact, she had been slightly disappointed that he hadn't brought any gifts after his trip abroad.

But to think he had prepared such an event.

Feeling embarrassed, she hurriedly changed the subject.

"Oh, it's almost curfew."

"It's getting late, so I'll make sure you get home safely."

"It's okay. I'll go on my own from here. By the way, my father wants to meet you, Chang-jin. When will you come over?"

"Me? Really?"

"I haven't brought it up because you seemed busy, but let's schedule it when you have time. We've been dating for over two years, and it's about time to introduce you."

Though it was a pleasant offer, knowing her family, Lee Chang-jin felt a bit worried.

"Will your father like someone as ordinary as me?"

"Oh, my father doesn't care about such things. It's the ability that matters, not the background. You can support me, right? If not, I can support you."

"If you think that way, it would be an honor. I'll make time, so feel free to call me anytime."

"Then, let's end it here for today. Get home safely. My dad doesn't like it when I'm late."

Jin Seon-ah stood on her tiptoes and gave him a light kiss.

Though feeling a bit of regret, Lee Chang-jin knew when to step back.

"Take care."

Jin Seon-ah watched Lee Chang-jin's back with tender eyes for a long time.

When he disappeared, her expression suddenly turned cold.

If Lee Chang-jin had seen her, he would have been shocked by her icy face.

She murmured quietly into the seemingly empty space.

"Mr. Yeon, are you there? Come out immediately."

With a swish, shadows appeared.

Three bodyguards in black suits.

One of the large bodyguards kneeled before her.

"Stop the show and stand up. Did my father send you?"

"Yes, it was the chairman's order."

Annoyed, Jin Seon-ah waved her hand dismissively.

"My father, really. Following a grown adult around. It's overprotection. I told him I don't like this."

Mr. Yeon bowed deeper, as if in apology, making Jin Seon-ah look like a small child next to his large frame.

"I'm sorry, Miss. It was a special order from the chairman."

"Did you also investigate Chang-jin?"

"Absolutely not."

"Don't lie. I'm not going to punish you. So, did you find out why Chang-jin got hurt? Report the truth."

Mr. Yeon reported everything that had happened.

After hearing the report, Jin Seon-ah made an uncomfortable expression.

After the report, she crossed her arms and laughed incredulously.

"Wow, this is really interesting. That woman, she’s the wife of the CEO of Se-young Construction, right?"

"Yes, that's correct."

"Hmm, but isn't Se-young Construction the company we lent money to?"

"That's right, Miss."

"Bring me their financial statements right now."

Jin Seon-ah carefully examined the documents Mr. Yeon brought and clicked her tongue in disapproval.

"This is too obviously fabricated. The accountants worked hard. Do you have more internal documents?"

"Yes."

"Bring them all. I need to verify what’s going on."

Seated at her office desk, Jin Seon-ah began reading through each document.

As she meticulously compared the documents, she smiled, having discovered something.

"This is a complete mess. How much money did they siphon off while pretending to be in the black with accounting fraud? And yet, she went on a shopping spree at the department store as if she were a queen?"

"This is just the tip of the iceberg. Including unpaid wages, it's several billion won."

"We can't let this slide. How much do we hold in promissory notes and bonds from this company?"

"About 5 billion won."

Jin Seon-ah snapped her fingers.

"Bravo! This is perfect. I was wondering where to pull the investment from, and this is just right."

"What do you mean by that...?"

"Before it’s too late, cash the promissory notes and collect the bonds immediately tomorrow. Don't show any mercy even if they plead. Selling off their assets should prevent any losses."

Mr. Yeon looked troubled and hesitant.

"But Miss, this is a significant amount... Is it alright to proceed without the chairman's approval?"

"Who am I?"

"You are the chairman's daughter."

"And?"

"The executive director of Daese Industries, Miss."

"That's right. And who is your boss, including your security team’s payroll?"

"You, Director."

"Then that settles it. If I say to do it, you do it. Got it? If you don't like it, you can quit right now."

Mr. Yeon bit his lip, realizing he had no choice.

"Sorry. I spoke out of turn."

"Then leave. Report everything to my father as it is. Oh, and stop tailing Chang-jin from tomorrow. This is a warning. If you get caught doing it again, it won't be pleasant. So, act wisely."

"I will keep that in mind."

Mr. Yeon bowed briefly and left the room. Jin Seon-ah gently caressed her lips.

When she buried her nose in the scarf, a fragrant scent wafted up.

Maybe because it was a gift from Lee Chang-jin, she couldn't help but smile.

As she fondled the silk scarf, she murmured quietly to herself.

"Lady, you shouldn't mess with what's not yours."
