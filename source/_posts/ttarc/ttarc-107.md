## Episode 107: The Camel's Head

At first glance, it might seem reckless, but it wasn't a completely nonsensical idea. The Arabian Peninsula was once a tropical savanna before desertification.

"Gaddafi succeeded in a similar grand water project with that goal in mind."

Even though the land was barren due to the lack of water, it didn't mean the soil itself was infertile.

Given that Dammam boasts clear skies year-round, farming might actually be feasible if sufficient water could be supplied.

If they could manage to grow vegetables in the desert, it would be like striking gold. Many Korean construction workers dispatched to the region were fed up with Western diets. Simply supplying Chinese cabbage for kimchi could secure a consumer base of at least 100,000 people.

However, thoughts and actions are entirely different matters. Farming in the desert could only be attempted by those with extensive knowledge of the local soil and weather conditions. Hence, Lee Chang-jin spent his weekends scouring the areas around Dammam for wild plant habitats and oases.

During this time, a local partner named Salman, who was familiar with the situation, gave a tip.

"If you're looking for a farming expert, why don't you meet Yang Hyun-wook? He's quite a famous eccentric around here and might be able to help."

"Yang Hyun-wook? Who's that?"

"Oh, he's been running a food company here for two years. He came to Saudi Arabia a few years ago as a laborer for the U.S. company Bechtel and was promoted to General Foreman, the highest rank a Korean could achieve. They say he was an agricultural expert who used to work as a houseboy in the U.S., so he might be of help."

Curious, Lee Chang-jin inquired at Bechtel and received this reply.

"Oh, Foreman Yang? He's a very famous person."

"Do you know him well?"

"Of course. Any Korean who worked at Bechtel and doesn't know Foreman Yang must be a spy. He was diligent and good at his job, though he had some eccentricities."

"What do you mean by eccentricities?"

"Workers who have been employed for over a year get one or two annual leaves. He used to take soil and water samples in plastic bags during his leaves, saying he was sending them to the Agricultural Promotion Agency and the National Industrial Research Institute for soil testing. He often mentioned the unbelievable idea of farming in Saudi Arabia. As a result, he was once detained by customs on suspicion of smuggling drugs."

Hearing this made Lee Chang-jin's ears perk up. He vaguely recalled hearing about a Korean who had successfully farmed Chinese cabbage in Saudi Arabia.

Out of curiosity, Lee Chang-jin asked again.

"Really? Where is he now?"

"He's currently running a grocery store near the King Fahd Bridge. The store's name is 'Yang Food Market,' though the nominal owner is someone else. Foreigners can't legally run businesses in Saudi Arabia, so a local person has to be the titular owner. But Yang runs the actual operations, so he's essentially the real owner. He makes all the tofu used in Korean restaurants here."

"When are the store hours?"

"From 8 AM to 2 PM and 2 PM to 10 PM. The store is open 365 days a year, so you can meet him anytime."

The next day, Lee Chang-jin, along with Goo Chang-dong, made time to visit the food market run by Yang Hyun-wook. However, when they arrived, the store was firmly closed, and there was no sound coming from inside.

It was a disappointing moment for Lee Chang-jin, who had been full of expectations.

"What's going on? Didn't they say it was open year-round?"

"Yes... This is the first time this has happened. I've never seen it closed before; it's strange."

Lee Chang-jin peered inside through the closed blinds.

Suddenly, there was a clunking sound, and someone came out of the building.

The man who appeared was a burly figure with a menacing look.

Seeing the group, the man with a skull tattoo on his arm rudely asked, "What are you doing in front of someone else's business? Can't you see the 'Closed' sign?"

"Oh, we heard the market was open year-round, so we came to buy some groceries. Is Mr. Yang here?"

"The boss is away. We're closed for a few days due to some issues, so please leave."

"Can you tell us what the issue is? Has he left the country?"

"I don't know. Anyway, we're not open today."

"Can we schedule an appointment with him?"

"That's not my call. Come back another time."

Goo Chang-dong, offended by the man's rude response, stepped forward.

"What's with your attitude toward people who came from far away? Aren't you an employee? What kind of lousy service is this?"

"Are you the one paying my salary? Why are you picking a fight?"

As Goo Chang-dong was about to step forward, Lee Chang-jin stopped him and bowed his head.

"I'm sorry. Our employee is a bit hot-headed. Let's just leave."

"Hey, leave while I'm asking nicely. It's hot, so don't make me lose my temper."

The man scratched his head irritably and went back inside the grocery store.

Watching the firmly closed door, Goo Chang-dong muttered suspiciously.

"That guy seems shady. His outfit is strange for an employee, and he doesn't look like one. Plus, who hires someone with tattoos like that?"

Consultant Kim Hak-do also seemed to agree.

"We should keep an eye on this."

"It's a bit odd, but we need to find out what's going on first. If we press now, it will cause a commotion. Let's watch the situation for a while."

Feeling uneasy, Lee Chang-jin instructed Hassan to observe the surroundings. After a while, Hassan returned and explained that people were periodically entering and leaving the grocery store despite the 'Closed' sign.

"Suspicious. It definitely seemed like they were being watched. They are up to something inside."

According to Hassan, it seemed like someone was confined inside. He mentioned hearing small shouts and threats from inside, which made Lee Chang-jin's expression serious.

"Human voices? You heard human voices from inside?"

"Yes, I definitely heard them."

Consultant Hong In-young, who had gone to check Yang Hyun-wook's whereabouts, returned after a while.

"You're back. Did you find any records or traces of Yang's departure?"

"Yes, nothing special. He returned from Korea not long ago, but it's strange that the food market is closed."

Lee Chang-jin had a hunch about what might have happened. It was clear that something had gone wrong with Yang's personal situation. However, he couldn't act hastily based on a mere suspicion.

"Shouldn't we report this to the embassy and request support?"

"On what grounds? They won't accept a support request without any evidence. Besides, it's better to handle this quietly. If Yang is involved in illegal activities, getting caught could result in deportation."

Saudi Arabia, being an Islamic country, is strict about disputes and fights. Since they were conducting construction projects in the country, causing unnecessary disputes could lead to disadvantages in future contracts.

As the discussion dragged on, Hassan stepped forward.

"Why are you making it so complicated? Let me help."

"Oh, Hassan?"

"Yes, I'm a local here. If a crime is happening, we can't just stand by. Plus, it's more beneficial for me to act than you outsiders."

Consultant Seo muttered, not entirely convinced.

"Can you really handle it quietly? It'll be a hassle if it gets noisy."

"Don't worry. I'm a quiet person by nature. Don't you trust me? We just need to confirm if someone is really confined. That's very easy."

"Then quietly scout and come back out."

With Hassan's bold words, Lee Chang-jin gave him some instructions and sent him to gather information. Disguised as a postal worker, Hassan knocked on the door of the food market, carrying a box disguised as an international package.

When he knocked, two men with turbans and fierce expressions walked out.

"Who are you?"

"Package delivery. Is this Yang Hyun-wook's place?"

"The owner is out, so leave it here."

"I need a signature. I can't deliver without it."

"No, you can't."

Hassan replied brazenly.

"Then pay up. Who's going to cover the shipping fee if I don't get paid?"

"What is this guy saying...? What kind of nonsense is this?"

"Just pay him and send him off. How much is it?"

As the man took out his wallet to pay, Hassan responded nonchalantly.

"Total is $5,000."

"What?"

"I said $5,000."

"How can the shipping fee be so expensive? That's ridiculous."

"It's always expensive. Pay up for the COD package."

The men, baffled by Hassan's attitude, started to get angry.

"Is this guy crazy? What kind of idiot is this? Get lost!"

"Hey, don't push me. If I get angry, Hassan gets scary."

"What the hell. Is this guy serious? Get out!"

Unable to hold back any longer, Hassan began to shake with anger.

"Did you just hit me?"

"Yeah, I did. What are you going to do about it? You look like an idiot..."

"Did you hit me? The Quran says 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' From now on, it's self-defense."

Before the man could react, Hassan punched him squarely in the nose.

As Hassan beat the man like a dog, the commotion caused people inside the food market to rush out.

A fistfight broke out instantly.

Consultant Seo shouted and ran, and others, including Kim Hak-do, joined the brawl.

"Damn it. I knew this would happen."

Goo Chang-dong also muttered and ran inside. There was no other way now. Lee Chang-jin had no choice but to run inside the market as well.

"Waahhhh!!"

With laborers hardened by tough physical work joining in, Ali's men were caught off guard.

"You bastards!!"

Ali's men, surprised by the sudden attack, tried to fight back, but Lee Chang-jin's team was quicker. Goo Chang-dong, who subdued an attacker with a throw, roared. Consultant Kim Hak-do also fought well, belying his age.

Seeing the unfavorable situation, one of Ali's men charged at Consultant Kim Hak-do with a knife.

"Careful!!"

Blocking the way, Lee Chang-jin twisted the attacker's arm and struck his knee.

As the man collapsed with a groan, Lee Chang-jin struck his throat with a pocket knife.

Ali, who came out late due to the commotion, was knocked out cold by Hassan with a frying pan. Ali's gang, shocked by the sudden attack, couldn't respond properly.

"Let's find the captive before the police arrive."

As expected, Yang Hyun-wook was found bound and unconscious in the basement. He was severely beaten, with his face swollen and unconscious. Goo Chang-dong carried him to a nearby emergency hospital.
