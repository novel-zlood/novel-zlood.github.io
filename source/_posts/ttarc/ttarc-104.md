## Episode 104: Middle East Expansion

As events unfolded differently from his expectations, Park Man-jae couldn't hide his confusion.

"No, what on earth is going on? Why has the ruling party's approval rating gone up?"

"The situation is turning strange, sir. According to the latest poll, Kim Hak-ki's approval rating is over 50%. Rumor has it that he is the strong candidate for the next district representative. It might be wise to begin public support efforts immediately..."

Hearing rumors that higher-ups were considering alternatives to Park Man-jae, the congressman hurriedly called his secretarial staff.

"Secretary Kim, get me a jumper from outside!"

"Excuse me?"

"Get me a jumper right now. We need to do something!"

The aide ran to the department store and fetched a conspicuous shiny jumper.

Wearing the jumper, Park Man-jae rushed to the scene and actively participated in the recovery efforts.

The sight of former aides clumsily digging with shovels was indeed a spectacle. People chuckled as they struggled to remove the stuck shovels.

The disaster victims watching them criticized them from behind.

"How can a grown man not even know how to use a shovel properly? What a sight."

"Leave him be. That guy was exempt from military service. Look at him putting on a show. So shameless."

Desperately trying to get even a single shot on TV, Park Man-jae's efforts were pitiful.

However, the public sentiment, which had already turned cold, had long since abandoned him.

Completely alienated from media attention, Park Man-jae quietly faded from public memory.

In contrast, Daese Construction's public favor and recognition skyrocketed as their logo continuously appeared in the media.

* * *

"The Model Leader Who Takes Responsibility, Daewoong Group's Stock Rebounds. Recovering for the Third Day..."

Three days later, a newly released newspaper article featured a brief interview with Daese Construction.

Reading the newspaper, Chief Seo muttered sarcastically.

"Very impressive. Noblesse Oblige, a model owner who takes responsibility. Mr. Lee, I see you have quite a way with words. You're very good at saying cringeworthy things."

Goo Chang-dong agreed.

"Chairman Sung must be in a tough spot. Look at the media's stance change after that big donation. The Hanseong Daily seems ready to sing his praises."

"Well, that's what they do for a living. Chairman Sung probably pocketed a hundred grand from him."

Lee Chang-jin laughed at Chief Seo's blunt reaction.

"Haha, don't be so sarcastic. Imagine how bitter they must feel. They were on the verge of losing tens of billions, and all they have left is their pride. They have to protect that at least."

"True. Without Mr. Lee, the recovery cost would have been less than half, barely scraping by."

"Indeed, sir. You've done a great job."

"Haha, given the circumstances, they couldn't just brush it off. By the way, Director Lee Chang-sik, how's the transfer of business rights going?"

"We've requested Taehun Law Firm to check the detailed transfer conditions and contract terms. We're thoroughly examining if there are any harmful clauses and the compensation regulations in case of unforeseen events, so it might take some time."

"Good. Report back as soon as the review is done. After reviewing the contract conditions, we need to get final approval for the transfer of business rights from the Middle Eastern client. Senior Advisor Hong will handle procuring domestic materials, and Manager Goo Chang-dong, prepare the list of first-round applicants and secure their visas."

"Yes, understood."

After Hong and Goo left, Chief Seo asked,

"So, what should I do?"

"Chief Seo, please contact the technicians who have visited the Middle East separately and check the climate conditions during the construction period. After the transfer of business rights, on-site verification will be necessary, so separate preparations will be needed. You might have to travel back and forth a few times for vacations, but you should consider the Middle East as your main workplace for the next few years."

"Understood. I'm already prepared for that. I just hope it’s not too hot."

The government, considering Daewoong's circumstances of selling business rights to raise disaster recovery funds, swiftly processed the necessary measures for the overseas construction bond transfer.

After Senior Advisor Hong In-young's advance team departed first, the headquarters continued to draw up a list of temporary construction materials needed for the construction. Having handed over the remaining recovery work to Daewoong, Lee Chang-jin also prepared for a visit to the Middle Eastern client for on-site investigation and greetings.

On the day of the business trip, Jin Seon-ah personally came to see him off at Gimpo Airport.

"Have a safe trip. Don’t overwork yourself. The weather in the Middle East is hot, so take care of your health."

"Don't worry, Seon-ah. I'll keep in touch often."

"Make sure to eat properly. You always miss meals because of work... I can't even go with you..."

"Madam, don't worry. That's why we’re here. Besides, I'll take good care of the boss."

"Alright. Then I’ll trust Manager Goo."

Lee Chang-jin walked toward the plane with a determined stride.

His destination was the Middle East.

* * *

The plane arrived at Daran International Airport around 10 PM.

After passing through immigration, the local partner from EWI appeared outside the airport.

"Asalamu Alaykum. Welcome to the Middle East, Mr. Lee."

Lee Chang-jin greeted him back politely.

"Wa Salaykum Salam. Nice to meet you, Mr. Salman."

"I've spoken to you often over the phone, but it's a pleasure to meet you in person. I've confirmed the list of equipment to be imported via telex. It's quite a lot."

In Middle Eastern countries, machinery and equipment imported for construction purposes are generally subject to re-export conditions. If no similar project follows after the completion of a specific project, the contractor can re-export without customs duties.

Lee Chang-jin’s first destination after landing was the Aramco headquarters, the ordering party. Reviewing the contract terms for the transfer of business rights, Lee Chang-jin found the conditions surprisingly lenient.

"Construction cost of 2,500 Riyals per square meter. The terms are more generous than I expected."

Salman, seated next to him, chimed in.

"Whether it's a small or large project, the time it takes is similar. Including local staff, it's more profitable to take on a large project. Usually, projects of this ambiguous scale are hard to find a proper contractor for, so the ordering party often bundles them. But having such an experienced person like you directly overseeing it is genuinely appreciated."

Manager Goo was surprised and asked,

"You're saying that 30 million dollars is a small scale? Then what's the average?"

"Usually, it's over 100 million dollars. Projects over 300 to 400 million dollars aren't uncommon either."

After showing off, it turned out the sold business rights included a bundled project...

But Lee Chang-jin decided to think positively.

Successfully completing the first project would mean an abundance of business rights to secure.

Before starting the main construction, it was necessary to understand the local rules, so Lee Chang-jin's team opted to receive a brief orientation with the help of a local company.

After crossing the fountain commemorating the discovery of oil and the King Fahd Bridge, the EWI building surrounded by lush palm trees came into view.

Once the staff arrived and unpacked their belongings, they gathered in the auditorium, and the local employee in charge began the orientation.

"First of all, everyone must ensure they don't lose their Iqamah (residency permit) separate from their passport in Saudi Arabia. If you leave it at the office and get caught in a police check, you'll have to fill out English and Arabic documents, get the responsible person's signature, and submit them."

The first session covered liquidated damages, potential construction issues, and legal problems that could arise from conflicts with locals.

Manager Goo, diligently taking notes, raised his hand to ask a question.

"I have a question. This is an Islamic country. Are there any religious-related issues?"

"Good question. This is an Islamic country with severe discrimination against foreigners. Even if you go to the consulate with documents and find the person in charge, they will prioritize Muslims. Moreover, according to Islamic law, work stops during prayer times, so it's better for your mental health not to hold a grudge about it."

Chief Seo asked seriously,

"That's quite strict. So, do workers have to report every time they move or leave the country?"

"Yes, that's correct. For the construction payment to be fully settled, the movements of the workers who were involved in the project must be tracked."

Other warnings included not talking to Saudi women privately, not drinking alcohol, and the suspension of public institution operations during prayer times.

Listening to the briefing, Chief Seo grumbled.

"Huh, these guys are a real pain... They only operate for their convenience."

"When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Don't worry too much. They called us because they need us. If you stick to the rules, it’s easier than it seems."

Large signs outside the window passed by rapidly. Once they left the city, shacks crowded together on sand dunes with no trees appeared.

The team drove for over an hour from Dammam towards the outskirts of Al Khobar.

As they drove through the sandy hills, temporary barracks and two dormitories came into view in the distance.

"Here we are!"

When the car door opened, the desert sand stuck to the car poured inside.

Familiar faces awaited them there.

"Mr. Lee Chang-jin!"

"You've become quite the Middle Easterner, Senior Advisor Hong."

"Haha, just getting used to it."

Hong In-young, who had departed with the first advance team, was already tanned dark.

He was in the middle of setting up temporary construction at the project site before the additional workforce arrived.

Consultant Kim, who showed off his bronze torso, was also recruited for this project.

After brief greetings, Lee Chang-jin checked the progress on-site.

"Thank you for your hard work in this heat. Is the construction going smoothly?"

"More or less. We're currently building five dormitory buildings for workers and a large dining hall that can accommodate over 2,000 employees and skilled workers simultaneously."

The blocks scattered around the desert looked like Lego toys.

While looking around, he noticed a partially collapsed building.

"But things seem a bit chaotic. What happened?"

"Ah, there was a strong sandstorm... While setting up the on-site office, a sudden gust of wind blew, causing the office building to collapse. Fortunately, no one was around, so there were no casualties. Haha..."

Consultant Kim laughed it off, but it wasn't something to be taken lightly.

Lee Chang-jin felt sorry for the boldness of Consultant Kim, who laughed off what could have been a significant accident.

"Thank you for your hard work. Is there anything you need?"

"There’s no place to escape the midday heat, so if you could get us some sunshades or parasols, that would be great. We currently take breaks from 2 PM to 5 PM and conduct the rest as night work."

Just stepping outside for a moment, the scorching sun made his skin sting. Imagining the workers' hardships in such heat, Lee Chang-jin nodded.

"I'll place an order in Korea as soon as the review is done. Then, Consultant Kim, please proceed with the geological survey first. Report back directly on whether separate pile construction is necessary after completing the section-wise survey."

"Don't worry, boss."

A week later, after completing the geological survey, Consultant Kim reported back to Lee Chang-jin.

"The geological survey results are out. Fortunately, although it's a weak ground, there's no need to drive piles in detail. However, there's one problem. The soil is sulfate-rich."

While typical soil is alkaline, the area Lee Chang-jin was in charge of had eight times more sulfate than ordinary soil. With his extensive field experience, Lee Chang-jin immediately understood the implications.

"So, we need to remove the topsoil and start with ground improvement work."

"Yes. To begin the work, we need to start with the replacement of the soil."

Since contact between sulfate and concrete accelerates corrosion, this construction was crucial for the building's durability. However, when they tried to source the necessary aggregate, an unexpected obstacle emerged.
