## Episode 124: Strategic Partner

Lee Chang-jin shared his recently conceived idea with the intrigued Jin Seon-ah. After hearing the plan, Jin Seon-ah let out a deflated sound.

“Pff~ I thought it was something big. So, in simple terms, you want to use an agent to poach Cha Geun-beom?”

“Poach? That's a rather disrespectful way to put it. It's just that for the player's future and the development of Korean football, it's better for Cha Geun-beom to go abroad rather than stay domestically. Besides, for future ventures into sportswear, don't we need a walking advertisement?”

The sportswear market is one where massive capital flows. Companies with big names like Adidas and Nike have all grown into major corporations through sports. However, to enter the functional clothing sector, brand recognition is essential, and marketing through sports stars is the best method.

Given that Cha Geun-beom had proven success even in previous lives, securing an agent contract with him would make it easier for Lee Chang-jin to venture internationally.

“Well, I understand. I don't know much about football, but I've heard of Cha Geun-beom. If you're saying this, he must be a player capable of making it overseas. I also know that in Europe, where the sports industry is developed, being an agent is quite a popular business item.”

“Thank you for understanding.”

“But, openly clashing with Taeyang Group seems a bit much. Last time, there were no issues because Cheong-woo was involved, but openly going against a major corporation is risky. Taeyang Group will put all their effort into it. It's an act that would hurt their pride.”

Lee Chang-jin smiled as if he had anticipated Jin Seon-ah's concern.

“Don’t worry. When did we say we would set up a team directly?”

“Then?”

“We need to find a heavyweight to face off against Taeyang. The weight classes need to be similar for a fair fight, don't they?”

At those words, Jin Seon-ah put on a thoughtful expression.

“If we're talking about someone interested in sports with qualifications that won't be overshadowed by Taeyang Group, it has to be a second-generation chaebol from the top 10 groups, right?”

“Exactly. You've got it right.”

“Hmm. As far as I know, there's only one person.”

“Who?”

“Joo Moon-kwang. He's the fifth son of Chairman Joo Il-hwan and a well-known football enthusiast.”

“If it's Joo Moon-kwang, he’s my fellow alumnus from Korea University. I've heard of him. Could you arrange a meeting with him?”

At Lee Chang-jin's sparkling question, Jin Seon-ah squinted her eyes slightly.

“Hmm, just like that?”

“Oh, come on, have I ever taken advantage of you without giving anything in return? Of course, I'll offer a fee for your trouble.”

Jin Seon-ah chuckled lightly at those words.

“Well, I was joking. No need for a fee. Instead, have a meal with my father this year-end.”

“Chairman Jin?”

“Yes. You see, with my mother's memorial day approaching, my father is feeling very down. He seems quite lonely, so I’d like you to keep him company. He's been traveling abroad frequently these days, and if he suddenly brings home a stepmother, that would be a disaster.”

“Hmm. Chairman Jin still seems young enough to remarry. He probably has the stamina to father a late child too.”

At those words, Jin Seon-ah glared angrily.

“Don't say such things even as a joke. I will never allow my father to remarry before I die. Why should I serve a stepmother not much older than me? This is a matter bigger than business. It's about the fate of our family!”

Lee Chang-jin raised both hands in surrender to Jin Seon-ah's emphatic words.

“Alright, alright. My bad. So, what should I do?”

“Go fishing with us next time. They say sons-in-law are like sons, right? Try to earn some points by acting like a son. Who knows? Maybe my father will be in a good mood and fully support you?”

“Haha. Got it. I was planning to see him again anyway.”

“Really? You promise?”

“Of course.”

“Okay, I’ll check Manager Joo’s schedule and arrange the meeting.”

A few days later, as promised, Jin Seon-ah arranged a meeting with Joo Moon-kwang.

Joo Moon-kwang, who was working as a manager in the sales department of Mirae Construction, was based at the Seoul headquarters.

When Lee Chang-jin arrived at the office, Joo Moon-kwang, who had been informed in advance, greeted him with a friendly smile.

“I’m Lee Chang-jin from Daese Industries. Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule.”

“I’m Joo Moon-kwang. Please, have a seat.”

As Lee Chang-jin sat on the office sofa, Joo Moon-kwang spoke first.

“I’ve only heard about you, but seeing you in person, you seem familiar. I heard we were both at Korea University. Did you by any chance take the Introduction to Psychology class with Professor Lee Sang-hak in your freshman year?”

“Oh, I remember him. The professor who guaranteed a B grade just for attendance and an A for active participation. It was rumored that getting a C grade in his class was harder.”

“Haha, it's embarrassing, but I actually managed that difficult feat. I kept missing classes because of drinking, and the professor ended up making me his assistant as a punishment. To top it off, he sent a long letter to my father the day the grades came out. Thanks to that, I studied really hard. Talking about it brings back memories.”

“Wow, you had a fruitful school life.”

As fellow alumni, Lee Chang-jin and Joo Moon-kwang had plenty of shared topics. The initial awkwardness faded, and Joo Moon-kwang gradually brought up the main topic.

“But why did you come to see me? If it’s about a construction issue in the Middle East, you’ve come to the wrong person. Talking to me, a mere subordinate, won’t yield any results. I’m just a shuttle doing what my father tells me. Unlike you, I’m purely from the liberal arts, so I’m not familiar with technical matters.”

“Haha, don’t worry about that. It’s a business matter but more public-oriented, and it needs young blood. I thought it would make more sense to talk to an active and younger manager like you rather than Chairman Joo.”

“Really? I’m curious. What is it about?”

“It's about establishing a soccer team.”

“Are you talking about a semi-professional team?”

Lee Chang-jin methodically laid out his plan. Listening quietly, Joo Moon-kwang chuckled.

“So, you want to use me to give Taeyang a hard time? You’re quite something.”

“Haha. Please don’t misunderstand. I’m only discussing this from a business perspective.”

“If you want to establish a team, there are plenty of interested companies. Why propose this to Mirae Group? Isn’t it something Daese Industries could handle directly?”

“Thank you for your high regard, but Daese Industries is still a small company, so it's premature for us. For the development of Korean football, it would be more progressive for a top-tier group like Mirae to foster a semi-professional team.”

Joo Moon-kwang crossed his arms with a curious expression.

“Your words are eloquent, but I feel there’s another motive. Do you hold a grudge against Taeyang Group? From chemical plants to military uniforms, and now a soccer team, you seem to have quite a few overlapping areas.”

Lee Chang-jin lightly denied with a shake of his head.

“No way. It's a coincidence. I’m not foolish enough to deliberately make an enemy out of a major corporation like Taeyang. I’m just surprised you’re so interested in me.”

“Well, haven’t you acted in a way that sparks interest? Within just a few years, you’ve built a solid mid-sized group from scratch. Based on the current situation, it seems like you have quite a grudge.”

“Haha, please don’t misunderstand. I’m not that meticulous.”

“Alright. Since you deny it, I have no choice but to believe you. Though I have my suspicions, I’ll stop here. Let’s get back to the topic. To be direct, what’s in it for me if I establish a team?”

After clearing his throat slightly, Lee Chang-jin continued.

“I’ve heard you are an avid football fan. Isn’t it a pity to see a talent like Cha Geun-beom wasting away domestically? If Mirae Group establishes a semi-professional team, I promise to have Cha Geun-beom join as a home team when he returns to Korea. Additionally, Daese Industries can assist with the sales and promotion of uniforms. As you know, we also deal with textiles. If you establish a sports team, we will provide all necessary supplies such as player uniforms, football boots, and knee guards for free.”

It was indeed a bold proposal. However, from Lee Chang-jin’s perspective, it wasn’t a losing deal. While it might be a loss initially, the team’s future performance would undoubtedly serve as a great advertisement.

Lee Chang-jin emphasized the additional revenue that could be generated through sports, including fostering employee unity and tax benefits for the investment.

He mentioned the official sponsorship fees, broadcasting rights, gate receipts, and World Cup dividends.

He also noted that once the professional league starts, it would become a lucrative market.

Despite the impressive pitch, Joo Moon-kwang remained indifferent.

“Well, it sounds too vague. The present is more important than the future. Our company's motto may be about the future, but a business’s purpose is to pursue profit. I’m not sure how beneficial running a sports team would be to Mirae Group in the present. I may love football, but hobbies and business are entirely different. Moreover, my father dislikes wasting money, so there’s not enough justification for me to take the risk of establishing a semi-professional team.”

Anticipating such a question, Lee Chang-jin continued.

“Wouldn't it be better to approach this from a more medium to long-term perspective? Running a sports team can create a public-friendly image. Additionally, if you have political aspirations, it would be advantageous for image management.”

Joo Moon-kwang paused momentarily at those words.

“What do you mean by that?”

“There’s no sport as good at drawing crowds as football. While boxing and wrestling are popular now, they have limitations as indoor sports. Football, being a team sport, has a broad fan base. The support from regional fans is solid. Football is a national sport that anyone can enjoy with just a ball. Supporting a semi-professional football team can help shed the image of a distant chaebol and create a friendly image, much like the current president’s Saemaul Movement.”

The term "3S policy" wasn’t coined for nothing. There’s no better way to connect with the public than through sports. If the team achieves remarkable results, it will be easy to garner attention.

For the first time, Joo Moon-kwang showed genuine interest.

“Interesting. But where did you hear that I have political aspirations?”

“By observing your past actions. Why else would a chaebol’s son attend Korea University? Studying so hard means you either aim to be a successor or...”

Lee Chang-jin pointed upwards with his finger.

“Aiming for a higher realm?”

Joo Moon-kwang, a second-generation politician from Mirae Group, was a prodigy who graduated from Jeil High School and attended Korea University’s law school. Among the Mirae Group siblings, he was known for his outstanding intellect.

In his past life, his father Joo Il-hwan initially chose him as the successor, but he later transitioned to politics, eventually becoming a seven-term congressman and a presidential candidate.

Laughing heartily, Joo Moon-kwang clapped his hands in admiration.

“Haha, you got me. Bravo! You’re right. Why else would I have gone to law school if I didn’t have political ambitions? But I’m still a businessman. Abstract concepts like image enhancement don’t hold much meaning in business.”

“Are you rejecting the idea?”

Seeing Lee Chang-jin’s disappointment, Joo Moon-kwang smiled broadly.

“Of course not. I’ll actively cooperate. But as a human, not as Mirae Group’s manager. Honestly, I’ve disliked Nam Tae-hee’s arrogance for a long time.”

“I completely agree with you.”

“But I have one condition. Or rather, a favor.”

“What is it?”

“Would you be my friend?”

“Friend?”

“I heard we’re the same age. I’ve also heard you’re known for your loyalty in the industry. I like people like that. Who knows? Maybe we can share some benefits if we become close?”

Lee Chang-jin found it amusing and raised the corner of his mouth.

“So, you’re saying we should be like a crocodile and a plover bird. Is that it?”

“Well, I’ll let you take the first move. If I ever enter politics, you could be a great help. From what I know, you have a good image in the Iksan area.”

A smile spread across Lee Chang-jin’s face.

“Haha, you’re looking far ahead.”

“You never know what might happen. I’m being honest because you’ve been straightforward. We can call it a strategic partnership if the term ‘friends’ feels awkward. It’s always good to have more allies for future big business ventures.”

“There’s no reason to refuse. Then let’s drop the formalities. Can I call you Moon-kwang from now on?”

“Of course. That’s what I was hoping for, Chang-jin.”

With their ambitions hidden within, the two men shook hands firmly.

For Lee Chang-jin, this was the moment he gained a lifelong friend.
