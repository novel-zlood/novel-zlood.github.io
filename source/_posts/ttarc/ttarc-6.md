## Episode 6: Corporate Life

One month later, at the Mannheim headquarters.

A design review meeting was in full swing at the Engineering Headquarters. As the Anyang Steel Mill project entered its final stages, senior staff, including Lee Chang-jin, were reporting on the revisions made so far.

"Manager Lee, how is the power supply equipment part progressing?"

Lee Chang-jin immediately responded to Manager Kim's question as he looked at the blueprints.

"Yes, the piping line in the cooling water system has been changed to a two-line system. Since we revised the line sizing, we also needed to change the design for the power part. We coordinated with the electrical control department to ensure that power from the MCC can be connected to the pump. We only need to finalize the control device part now."

Manager Kim nodded with satisfaction.

"Well handled. Who are we sending for on-site supervision?"

"We plan to dispatch Assistant Manager So Yeon-jin from the supervision department."

'Supervision' refers to the task of overseeing whether a plant or building is being constructed as designed.

Due to the unexpected design changes that caused confusion at Mannheim, the company changed its policy to send supervisors directly instead of outsourcing the work.

"Make sure to warn them clearly. If there are any changes without notice like last time, it will be a problem. If there's a mistake during the test run, our team will take the blame. Make sure to thoroughly check the equipment quality and inspect every anchor bolt."

"Yes, understood."

"Then, Manager Jung, it's your turn. Have you finished reviewing the auxiliary steam system?"

However, Manager Jung, half-asleep, did not respond.

Manager Kim banged on the table loudly to wake him up.

"Hey! Manager Jung!!"

"Yes! Private Jung Pil-joo! I was not sleeping!"

Jung Pil-joo sprang up like a spring and saluted, making the staff laugh out loud.

Realizing what he had done, he blushed, and Manager Kim gave him a scornful look.

"Manager Jung, do you want to go back to the army? If you want, you can have a simulated experience."

"S... sorry."

"Well, wipe the drool off your mouth first. Go wash your face."

Manager Jung returned after washing his face. He looked more refreshed but still pale.

Manager Kim, who had scolded him earlier, was now absent, perhaps having gone to make coffee. Deputy Manager Seo, guessing the situation, clicked his tongue and whispered.

"Looks like you took the certification exam this time. You're working hard..."

Deputy Manager Seo was seven years senior to Manager Jung.

Surprised by his accurate guess, Manager Jung asked, "How did you know?"

"It's obvious. The company's atmosphere has been like that lately. But why go through all that trouble?"

"Who studies because they want to? We do it because we get an allowance."

In 1974, Korea officially introduced the technical certification system. To promote it, the government allocated quotas to companies related to technical jobs and provided tax benefits to those with a certain number of certified employees.

Mannheim, an engineering company, also followed this trend. They decided to give a special allowance to employees who obtained technical certifications. Those who passed the certification exam received a reward of 30,000 won and an additional 3% of their monthly salary as an allowance.

For salaried workers, it was a considerable amount.

Thanks to this, a sudden wave of studying swept through the company.

Watching this, Deputy Manager Seo sighed.

"Ugh, it's been so long since I graduated from college, and now I'm studying again. Will I be studying until I die?"

"Haha, but it's not a bad thing to get certified, right? How about you, Deputy Manager? You have the experience, so the practical test shouldn't be a problem. You only need to study the theory intensively for a few months."

At Lee Chang-jin's supportive remark, Deputy Manager Seo shuddered as if horrified.

"Don't even joke about that. Are you trying to kill someone? It might be doable in my 30s, but at this age, studying is out of the question. I've given up. I'll live comfortably like this."

As they chatted, Manager Kim returned to his seat.

"Alright, let's start the meeting again if everyone's ready."

After the meeting, during a short break, Lee Chang-jin went up to the rooftop for some fresh air.

Holding a mug, he saw that Jung Pil-joo was already there, smoking a cigarette.

"Are you awake now?"

"Yeah, I was scared out of my wits. Falling asleep at that moment, my heart almost dropped."

"You're lucky. Be thankful that Manager Kim is your supervisor. If it were someone else, you'd have been in serious trouble."

"Yeah, life is really tough..."

"Hey, nothing comes easy in this world. Hang in there."

"I just want an easy life... Can't some fortune fall from the sky?"

"Dream on. Just hang in there. Someday, the sun will shine on you."

Despite being somewhat clumsy, Jung Pil-joo was well-suited to company life.

Even after Lee Chang-jin left the company, he steadily climbed up the ranks.

He eventually became a vice president at a major company, which is quite an accomplishment for a salaried worker.

Jung Pil-joo smiled faintly at Lee Chang-jin's encouragement.

"Do you want a cigarette?"

"Thanks. I won't refuse."

Lee Chang-jin appreciated the offer.

He was financially tight because he had spent all his money on fuel.

He couldn't cut down on meal or transportation costs, so he had to save on luxuries like cigarettes.

Soon, white smoke billowed from Lee Chang-jin's mouth.

"Wow... It's been a while since I smoked. It feels good."

Enjoying the taste slowly as if reminiscing about the past.

Watching him, Jung Pil-joo asked tentatively.

"Manager Lee, did you take the exam too?"

"Yeah, I took it."

"What do you think? Any chance of passing?"

Jung Pil-joo asked curiously, and Lee Chang-jin shook his head.

"No, I thought it would be easy since it was the first time, but the difficulty was no joke."

"Right? My mind went blank as soon as I saw the questions. I recently bought a car with great determination... I'm worried. I boasted to my wife too."

Jung Pil-joo sighed, and Lee Chang-jin patted his shoulder.

"Haha. Don't worry. Is this the only chance? If you fail, you can take it again."

"Man, how can I go through that again? You're cursing me."

Lee Chang-jin grinned and silently drank his coffee.

Although he planned to quit soon, he still took the exam.

To be recognized as an expert in the mechanical field, having a certification was essential.

Once he became independent, he wouldn't have time to study.

'Well, I took five exams, so I should pass at least one.'

He had stayed up late, pushing himself to prepare for the exams.

His neck still felt stiff, probably because of that.

Despite his best efforts, the outcome was uncertain.

But thinking about it wouldn't change anything.

Lee Chang-jin stubbed out his cigarette and stretched his clasped hands forward.

After getting some fresh air, he returned to his desk and resumed his work.

Time passed quickly as he focused on his tasks.

Soon, the bell signaling meal time rang.

Manager Kim clapped his hands to get everyone's attention.

"Alright, everyone, let's disperse and eat. See you in two hours."

People, who had been sluggish until a moment ago, brightened up at the mention of food.

They started gathering their jackets and getting ready to move.

"Are you having lunch?"

"Well, I have another appointment..."

Making an excuse, Lee Chang-jin quickly got into the elevator.

He preferred eating alone rather than mingling with others.

As he hurried through the lobby, he heard murmuring in the middle of the lobby.

"Who is she? Our company's promotional model?"

"Wow, she looks amazing... She has a celebrity vibe."

A rare tall and Western-style figure for this era.

A sleek office look.

She was a beauty who naturally drew attention.

Seeing her face again, Lee Chang-jin momentarily froze.

It was none other than Jin Seon-ah. Her makeup was carefully done, making her look very radiant.

Spotting Lee Chang-jin, she waved cheerfully.

"Chang-jin! Over here, over here."

Suddenly, all eyes were on her. Her wavy hair swayed.

Feeling embarrassed by the attention, Lee Chang-jin hurried over to her.

He led her to a corner and whispered.

"What brings you here, Assistant Manager Jin? This puts me in a difficult position."

"Humph, who broke the promise first? It's troublesome if the debtor suddenly disappears, so I came to check."

"What do you mean disappear... What are you talking about?"

Lee Chang-jin was flabbergasted. Jin Seon-ah reminded him of their agreed-upon arrangement.

"Oh my, did you forget already? I told you I might come looking if you didn't answer your phone on time. I called you three times yesterday."

"Ah... that..."

Lee Chang-jin suddenly remembered last night. He had fallen asleep exhausted after the exams, and he vaguely recalled his phone ringing in his sleep. Embarrassed, he apologized.

"Ah, I was really tired... I forgot. I'm sorry."

Jin Seon-ah nodded understandingly at his apology.

"That can happen. But you seem to have lost weight since the last time. Do you exercise at night?"

Jin Seon-ah approached him with concern. A faint scent of Chanel wafted from her swaying hair. It was the same perfume Marilyn Monroe was said to wear to bed.

As he caught a whiff of the scent, Lee Chang-jin's heart started pounding uncontrollably.

Why am I feeling like this all of a sudden?

As he backed away, Jin Seon-ah raised an eyebrow.

"Why are you avoiding me? Do you have something to hide?"

"It's not that, but..."

Lee Chang-jin was saved from his predicament by the arrival of his colleagues in the lobby.

Manager Kim, seeing him, called out.

"Hey, Manager Lee, you haven't left yet. Want to join us? We're going for some braised chicken..."

"Ah, Manager Kim?"

"But who is this lady?"

"Well... She's someone I'm doing business with."

"Business? What kind of business?"

"Actually..."

Before Lee Chang-jin could come up with an excuse, Jin Seon-ah spoke first.

"Hello, I'm Jin Seon-ah, Lee Chang-jin's fiancée."

Jin Seon-ah, linking arms with Lee Chang-jin, smiled brightly.

"Really?"

"Is that true, Manager?"

The employees' reactions were priceless.

Jin Seon-ah poked Lee Chang-jin in the side.

Everyone seemed quite shocked.

To be engaged to such a beautiful woman who looked like a celebrity.

Manager Jung whistled.

"Wow, it's not just business. It's a romantic business."

"How could you hide such a beauty from us?"

"I feel betrayed, Manager Lee. We thought you were single."

Faced with jealous and accusatory remarks, Lee Chang-jin scratched his head.

He had no words or excuses.

Jin Seon-ah, noticing his discomfort, acted coyly.

"Sorry. My family is quite strict... It's not Chang-jin's fault."

She naturally linked arms and asked for their understanding, making everyone sigh.

There were even admiring comments like 'I'm jealous.'

"Wow, Chang-jin hit the jackpot. He's really lucky."

"I respect you, Manager Lee. You're quite capable..."

Even the female employees swarmed around and started questioning her.

"So, where did you meet Chang-jin oppa?"

Answering the barrage of questions, Jin Seon-ah.

Watching the scene unfold, Lee Chang-jin was amazed.

Who taught her, he didn't know, but her acting was top-notch.

After a while, Jin Seon-ah, realizing the time, asked for their understanding.

"Sorry, but we're short on time. Is it okay if I borrow Chang-jin for a bit?"

At her request, everyone stepped aside willingly.

"Of course. You don't have to return him."

"Take care, sister-in-law."

Leaving the enthusiastic crowd behind, Lee Chang-jin and Jin Seon-ah safely exited the lobby.

Lee Chang-jin mischievously asked.

"But I don't remember us ever going on a trip to Busan?"

Jin Seon-ah shrugged as if she had no choice.

"Well, what can we do? There are white lies in the world too. Anyway, I'm hungry since I skipped breakfast. Is there a good restaurant nearby? It would be nice to eat and talk..."

"The weather is getting chilly, so how about some warm soup?"

"Do you have a place in mind?"

"Yes. There's a famous seolleongtang restaurant called Hanil-gwan nearby. It has a market atmosphere, but the food is good."

"That sounds nice. I like seolleongtang."

Hanil-gwan was about three blocks away from Mannheim's headquarters.

As they approached the restaurant, steam was billowing from a cauldron outside the door.
