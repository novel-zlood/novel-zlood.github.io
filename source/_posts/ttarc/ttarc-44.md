## Episode 44: Kim's Atelier

Kim Bong-su pleaded, "Since you're here, why don't you look at a few outfits?"

"Huh? But..."

Jin Seon-ah, looking uneasy, glanced at Lee Chang-jin, worried about what he might think.

Sensing the situation, Kim Bong-su spoke again, "Then how about you take a look around the atelier, Chang-jin? It's a rare opportunity."

"It sounds fun. To be honest, I've always been curious about how an atelier looks."

"Then, let's all go together."

Kim's Atelier, located in Samcheong-dong, was Kim Bong-su's studio. The exterior was entirely decorated in white. Reflecting the owner's taste, the entrance was lined with flashy chandeliers and cherry blossom decorations. Busts of angels and mannequins dressed in brightly colored wedding dresses were also on display.

Inside the atelier, filled with the subtle scent of the forest, the sensual tones of a mezzo-soprano and melancholic melodies filled the air. While listening to the music from a record, Lee Chang-jin absentmindedly muttered, "It's Carmen's Habanera."

"Oh, how did you know?"

"I had a friend who was really into classical music, so I've heard it once."

"You have a deep knowledge of music, Chang-jin. I love opera too. Verdi, Puccini, Mozart, those are my favorites. When I was young, I attended a rural school in Jeongseon, but I came to Seoul just to see an opera. With my first paycheck from working at an atelier, I had a suit made and visited the National Theater for the first time. The experience was unforgettable. Since then, music has become a part of my life."

As Kim Bong-su praised music, they looked around the atelier, which was dominated by white-themed creations.

"There are so many white clothes. And so many different kinds."

Kim Bong-su proudly said, "White symbolizes purity. I change my white outfits more than six times a season. Silk looks too flashy, so I usually use cotton. Come this way."

Kim Bong-su guided them to a room with an antique atmosphere. Nearby, a man in a gray checkered suit with a slightly tilted beret held hands with a woman in a tight-fitting hot pink dress with a bell-shaped cloche hat adorned with lace.

Women in white high-neck long dresses, lace gloves, and corsages were leisurely sipping tea.

The scene, reminiscent of 1930s Gyeongseong, looked like a scene from a movie.

"Oh my, what is all this?"

"I'm planning a fashion show early next year, and the theme is retro. I've been really into vintage styles lately. I'm researching how to give it a modern twist."

"Vintage? Is it from the 1930s? It looks modern."

"Ah, you got it right. Gyeongseong fashion is heavily decorated and colorful, making the figure look beautiful. I personally verified the interior decorations by visiting old Japanese-style houses in Gunsan."

True to the 1930s Gyeongseong style, there were feather-brushed hats, form-fitting velvet dresses, bold accessories, embroidered lace gloves, and mini handbags. Jin Seon-ah couldn't take her eyes off the cute items, and Kim Bong-su made a suggestion.

"Would you like to try on one of these outfits and stand over there? It's a new creation, and we want to see how it looks on you. You can accessorize as you like."

"Is that okay?"

"Of course."

After a while, Jin Seon-ah, slightly embarrassed, twirled a parasol and asked, "How do I look? Teacher, Chang-jin?"

"Oh, beautiful. Very elegant. Just as I imagined."

"You look like an aristocratic lady. It suits you very well."

With flowing sleeves, white gloves covering her wrists, a white dress with gold buttons, a tailored coat, and a white parasol, she looked like a modern woman from the enlightenment era.

"It would be boring for you to just watch. How about you try on something too, Chang-jin?"

"Me? No, I'm fine."

As Lee Chang-jin waved his hands dismissively, Kim Bong-su insisted, "Come on, give it a try. The harmony of fashion is complete with a pair. Beauty is harmony; a male and female pair creates true harmony. Isn't that the essence of life?"

"Yes, Chang-jin, you should try it. I think it would suit you perfectly."

"Alright then."

Pushed into it, Lee Chang-jin changed into a classic attire with a white shirt, tie, and a tailored vest. With suspenders, a monocle, and a pocket watch, he looked like a gentleman from Gyeongseong.

"Wow, Chang-jin, you look great. It really suits you."

"Fantastic! The suit fits perfectly. Now, stand together like a couple."

When the two stood together, it created a picture-perfect scene.

Every time they changed outfits, Kim Bong-su clapped enthusiastically and exclaimed exaggerated compliments.

"Bravo! Chang-jin, a bit more dandy... Seon-ah, give a more demure expression. Magnificent! That's it! How about changing the accessories to something more classic for a better touch?"

Though they started reluctantly, they soon found themselves enjoying posing.

It felt like traveling back to the Gyeongseong era.

The combined session of trying on clothes and the show lasted for over an hour and a half. From a sheer but luxurious object dress to a floor-length velvet dress, Seon-ah got immersed in trying on various outfits, and time flew by.

After a while, Kim Bong-su checked his wristwatch and exclaimed in surprise, "Oh my, it's already 11 o'clock. I'm really sorry. I kept you too long."

"No, it was fun. I got so immersed that I didn't notice the time passing."

"How about you, Chang-jin?"

"I enjoyed it too. I've never tried on so many clothes in one day."

"Do you like any of the outfits? Which one was your favorite among the ones you tried on?"

"I liked the second outfit the best. It seemed the most practical. I think I can wear it with a trench coat without needing much coordination."

"Then take it with you. It's a gift."

"Huh? But..."

"It's the least I can do for you modeling. I had a great time too. I noticed it fits you very wellâ€”broad shoulders, small head, perfect model physique. Have you ever thought about modeling?"

"Haha, thank you for the offer, but I'll have to decline. I'm already so busy with my current job that I could use two bodies."

"Ah, you're a businessman, right? That's a shame. But please take the outfit as a gift."

"Yes, Chang-jin. Accept the kindness."

"Alright, then. I'll accept it gratefully."

Lee Chang-jin quickly loaded the clothes into the trunk of his car.

Except for one outfit, all the clothes were ordered by Jin Seon-ah.

Fortunately, the parking spot wasn't far, so it didn't take long to load everything.

As they were about to part, Kim Bong-su came out to see them off.

"I had a great time today, Mr. Kim. Thank you."

"Please come by often. It gets lonely without you, Seon-ah. You're my muse, after all. Ah, Chang-jin, don't misunderstand. I pursue platonic relationships."

"Haha, don't worry. I won't misunderstand."

Jin Seon-ah warmly hugged him and said goodbye with a kiss on the cheek.

"Thank you always, Mr. Kim. I'll visit often when I have time."

"Ah, Chang-jin, if you change your mind, contact me anytime. You're always welcome..."

"Yes. Thank you very much today. Please take good care of Seon-ah."

Next to Kim Bong-su's business card, decorated with Cupid's arrow and small angel wings, Kim Bong-su bowed politely until Lee Chang-jin's car was out of sight. Looking at the rearview mirror, Lee Chang-jin muttered in admiration.

"He is such a humble person. It's not easy to act like that from his position..."

"Yes, he has a great personality. But some people misunderstand him because of his manner of speaking and behavior. It's really unfortunate."

"People tend to see only what they want to see. They don't understand that substance is more important than appearance."

As Lee Chang-jin's car passed Toegye-ro and arrived in front of Jangchung-dong, it was late at night. Jin Seon-ah, cautiously, asked for understanding.

"Since there are prying eyes around, it's better to part ways here."

"Got it. But can you carry all that stuff alone?"

"Of course. I'm stronger than I look. See, I even have muscles."

Seeing Jin Seon-ah jokingly flex her nonexistent muscles, Lee Chang-jin chuckled softly.

"Thank you for today. Oh, and bring your brother over if he passes the exam. I'd like to treat him to a meal."

"Alright. Get home safely."

After seeing her off, Lee Chang-jin drove away leisurely. Jin Seon-ah returned home with her hands full of clothes, carefully looking around at the dim lights.

"Are they already asleep?"

As she quietly climbed the stairs, she suddenly heard a coughing sound.

"Oh my, you scared me!"

"You're back now? That took a while."

Jin Tae-chun, looking displeased, stood with his arms crossed, gazing at Jin Seon-ah disdainfully.

Caught off guard, Jin Seon-ah awkwardly smiled.

"Ah, Dad! You're still up? You must be tired."

"I came out for a glass of water. Why do you stay out so late? You're a grown woman, why do you wander around at this hour?"

"Dad, come on~ I just went to Samcheong-dong to pick up the clothes I ordered."

Showing the clothes, Jin Seon-ah spoke nonchalantly.

"Samcheong-dong? You could have sent someone to get them. Why go yourself?"

"I wanted to get some fresh air. And I met Mr. Kim and did some fittings."

After a moment of silence, Jin Tae-chun softened his gaze and spoke gently.

"Don't stay out late. It's dangerous for a woman to be out at night."

"Don't worry. I'm a third-degree black belt in Hapkido. I even learned self-defense from a special forces soldier. See? Hi-yah! Yah!"

Her imitation of self-defense moves was adorable.

Jin Tae-chun snorted and chuckled.

"Stop showing off and go to bed. Oh, and wash your face before sleeping. You'll get pimples if you sleep with makeup on."

"Alright, Dad. I'm not a kid, you know? Good night."

After bowing, Jin Seon-ah went up to her room. Jin Tae-chun, watching his daughter fondly, quickly changed his expression once she was out of sight.

Sitting on the sofa, Jin Tae-chun tapped the armrest twice with his finger, and a bespectacled secretary appeared with a sliding sound.

"Yes, Chairman. Did you call?"

"What do you think, Secretary Kim? She must have found a man, right?"

"Most likely. Her daily movements are different, and her emotional fluctuations are more intense. She smiles a lot more too."

"Right? Find out who that guy is. Report to me as soon as you know. If he's not suitable, skip the report and handle it quietly. You understand what I mean?"

"Yes, Chairman. I understand."

After bowing, the secretary disappeared. Jin Tae-chun felt conflicted. He understood that beautiful flowers attract insects.

Sighing, Jin Tae-chun muttered to himself, "Again? I hope he's a decent guy this time."
