## Episode 36 - GMTN

As the steam inside escaped, it rose in a plume.

When the external and internal pressures equalized, there was a loud noise like steam escaping from a pressure cooker. Shortly after, the iron door opened, revealing the coiled wires inside.

As the sound of clanking metal filled the air, the people who had been observing eagerly rushed forward to inspect the wires that emerged from the rail. Everyone was curious about the performance of the electric dryer and couldn’t wait any longer.

The wires were bone dry without any trace of moisture.

An employee brought a loupe close to the wire, carefully inspecting it for any abnormalities.

Watching anxiously, Yoo Joon-tae asked cautiously, "How is it? Any issues with the drying?"

After closely examining the outer layer for a while, the employee put down the loupe and replied, "No, everything seems perfect. It appears to be completely dry."

"Really? Is that true?"

"Yes, it looks fine even under the loupe. It should be safe to use."

At that, Yoo Joon-tae’s tense expression relaxed.

"Haha, so it is. My judgment wasn't wrong after all. Well done, Mr. Lee!"

"Thank you. It's all thanks to your trust and support, Mr. Yoo."

"Nonsense. It's all your credit. And I heard you had help from someone?"

"Yes, it wouldn't have been possible without the help of Master Shin Dae-gil here."

Yoo Joon-tae approached Shin Dae-gil and clasped his hands warmly.

"On behalf of Anyang Steel, thank you, Master Shin Dae-gil. Thanks to you, we’ve significantly reduced production costs."

"No, I don't deserve such gratitude. Master? That’s too much."

"No, really. You've achieved something even the world's leading companies couldn't. You truly deserve the title of Master. You, sir, are a pride of Korea. Everyone, applause!"

At Yoo Joon-tae’s words, the executives, who had been waiting, began to clap enthusiastically. Overwhelmed by the applause, Master Shin seemed unsure of how to respond. Although he didn't show it, Master Shin had been quite nervous about the potential for failure. Despite his confident demeanor, he had been worried about the project going wrong.

After the storm of applause subsided, Master Shin finally let out a sigh of relief.

"Ah, I thought my heart was going to drop. I was terrified it might go wrong. You have a strong heart, Mr. Lee. How can you stay so calm?"

"Because it was your work, Master Shin. Congratulations. You really did it."

Master Shin looked proud of himself.

With a teasing tone, Yongpal added, "Master Shin, this might even be in textbooks. Isn’t this a world first?"

"Stop joking around and get out of here."

"Haha, you’re happy, aren’t you? Alright, alright."

Fortunately, the anticipated air leak problem did not occur. As expected, Anyang Steel had installed a vacuum pump with specs far exceeding the requirements, so there were no issues with the sealing.

The new vacuum dryer was especially efficient. By eliminating the need for crane operations and simplifying the work process, efficiency was doubled.

In the new process, the door was opened with a hydraulic device, the wires were pushed in on a cart, the case was closed, and the drying work was immediately started. This eliminated the need for a separate crane operator.

The exceptional performance of the new dryer created a celebratory atmosphere among the Daese Group employees.

After the performance test, Section Chief Eom called for a meeting.

Seated across from Lee Chang-jin in the meeting room, Section Chief Eom handed him a thick envelope.

"We’ve confirmed the quality. Here is the payment you requested."

"Thank you."

Peeking inside the envelope, Lee Chang-jin saw crisp checks and cash instead of a promissory note.

Section Chief Eom continued, "As you requested, the registration for utility model and technical patents will be assisted by our company’s patent attorney. The utility model patent must be something not currently used by other products. So, we’ve registered a paper on the technology structures related to the hydraulic device technology and metal precision processing associated with the sealing vacuum technology of the vacuum dryer. The review is handled by the Machinery Industry Promotion Association under the Ministry of Commerce, so it shouldn’t take long, as their president is one of our own."

"Thank you. It’s all thanks to your guidance, hyung."

"No need for thanks. It’s your hard work. We plan to order three more units from the company this week. And now, the real topic: at the end of May, an international metal exhibition will be held in Düsseldorf. We want to showcase the vacuum dryer there. Our company will also be participating."

Lee Chang-jin was surprised and asked, "The exhibition in Düsseldorf… do you mean GMTN?"

"Wow, you’re well-informed about the industry. Then I don’t need to explain further. Yes, the new industrial furnace and heat treatment technology exhibition (THERMPROCESS) will be part of it. A total of four exhibitions will be held. It’s one of the world's largest metal exhibitions, so showcasing there will draw attention from major international industries. Our company is also fully prepared for this."

GMTN is the world’s largest metal exhibition held every four years in Düsseldorf, Germany. It combines GIFA (foundry technology), METEC (metallurgical technology), THERMPROCESS (heat treatment technology), and NEWCAST (casting technology).

Held every four years, these four exhibitions cover a wide range of metal processing technologies including steel, steelmaking, rolling, non-ferrous metal production, foundry, related equipment, die-casting machines, melting processes, control and measurement technology, non-ferrous metal casting, distribution and logistics, environmental protection technology, and waste treatment.

Moreover, it attracts over 1,200 exhibitors and more than 38,000 visitors each year, making it a vibrant business venue with a significant portion of participants from overseas. 

Thinking for a moment, Lee Chang-jin replied, "Thank you very much, but can we participate right away? I believe the product registration for the exhibition is already closed. Also, the costs are quite substantial."

If it were a domestic or Japanese exhibition, it might be different.

But an exhibition in Germany would incur huge costs. Not only attending but also transporting equipment and technicians would be expensive.

For a small company like Daese Group, even securing a booth was a big deal.

Section Chief Eom, sensing his concern, reassured him, "Don’t worry about that. Anyang Steel is the host of the Korean pavilion, so adding one more participant won’t be a problem. The vacuum dryer we made this time is quite innovative globally. If you don’t mind, we’d like to officially invite those who contributed to the product as technical advisors. This exhibition is funded by the government and the business world to raise international awareness and gather information on advanced technologies and new products. There’s plenty of budget, so you don’t need to worry about the costs. Besides, Daese Group is our partner. Securing a booth for you should not be an issue."

Section Chief Eom’s support indicated that this exhibition was a government-led initiative to boost international recognition and easily access information on advanced technology and new products.

It was an unmissable opportunity to promote Daese Group.

Lee Chang-jin bowed his head gratefully.

"Thank you very much for this opportunity. However, the decision on the business trip cannot be made lightly, so I will discuss it with my employees and decide as soon as possible."

"Alright, it’s a great opportunity. Don’t miss it and make sure to attend."

Back at the Yeongcheon factory in Seodaemun-gu, Lee Chang-jin convened a staff meeting.

Upon hearing the news, the employees were visibly excited.

Seo Yohan stammered excitedly, "Are you saying our products will be showcased at an international metal exhibition in Germany?"

"Yes. Not on our own, but as a partner under Anyang Steel's name."

"That’s still amazing! The promotional effect of showcasing at such an international exhibition is no joke, right?"

"Haha, indeed it is. This exhibition is quite renowned worldwide. If we get a booth and showcase our products, we’ll be able to introduce them to international buyers. So, I’m looking for volunteers to accompany me to the exhibition. Anyone interested?"

As soon as he finished speaking, the employees all raised their hands.

The first to raise his hand was none other than Koo Chang-dong.

"Me! I’ll go. How can the boss’s right-hand man miss such an important event?"

"I believe I’ve contributed significantly as well, Boss. Please take me. I’ll even carry the luggage."

"Boss, I also want to go abroad. A person should experience the big world, right?"

Amused by their enthusiasm, Lee Chang-jin chuckled. They all seemed eager to go.

Looking at his eager employees, Lee Chang-jin said gently, "Then I’ll leave this matter to Manager Koo. Manager Koo, please select the employees who will accompany you."

"Yay! Did you all hear that? Line up behind me!"

It was a considerate gesture for Koo Chang-dong, who liked to take charge.

Given his age, it was better to give him a platform to assert his authority.

After entrusting the employee selection to Koo Chang-dong, Lee Chang-jin sought out Master Shin individually to invite him along.

However, Master Shin showed reluctance rather than acceptance.

"Sorry, but I can't go. I just can’t."

"Why? This is a chance to showcase your skills to the world. They’re giving us full support, and you refuse?"

"Such things are for youngsters like you. Not for me. I absolutely can’t go."

Seeing Master Shin grumbling and walking away, Lee Chang-jin looked puzzled.

"Why is he acting like this? Did something upset him today?"

Yongpal, munching on puffed rice nearby, casually responded, "Oh, you didn’t know? Master Shin has a severe fear of heights. He’s scared of tall buildings, so how can he take a plane? He must be terrified."

"Hmm… That’s a problem. Without him, setting up the equipment will be difficult."

From Lee Chang-jin’s perspective, an expert like Master Shin was essential, as unexpected issues might arise during the exhibition. Yongpal confidently replied, "Don’t worry, Boss. I'll persuade him to come. If push comes to shove, I’ll tie him up and bring him."

"Please do, but don’t actually tie him up."

Thankfully, thanks to Yongpal’s persuasion, Master Shin eventually agreed to join the flight to Germany. A few days later, Lee Chang-jin received an official letter instructing him to install the small vacuum dryer model, originally made for prototype purposes, at the exhibition hall in Germany.

Having prepared their passports, Lee Chang-jin and his team boarded a Boeing 747. The Boeing 747, known for its large and beautiful size, was the flagship model of Boeing at the time.

The employees were impressed by the spacious interior of the plane.

"Wow, this looks like a hotel room."

"Oh, come on. You’ve never been to a hotel. How would you know?"

"Have you ever been to a hotel?"

"Of course. I even worked as a bellboy there."

"Really?"

In the 70s, overseas travel wasn’t common, making the spacious cabins and excellent service even more impressive. The selected employees for this trip were very excited, busy looking around.

"Hey, look. Doesn’t it seem like the plane is smiling?"

"Yeah, really. That’s funny."

The sight of the plane’s nose slightly open, waiting to load cargo, made it look like it was smiling.

But while the employees were excited, Master Shin sat nervously in his seat, gripping his chair tightly, his eyes darting around.

"My heart is pounding so hard. What if we crash?"

"Come on, relax. We haven’t even taken off yet. You were in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Why are you so scared? Aren’t you a Marine who can even tackle ghosts?"

"Ghosts and people are on the ground. People should stay on the ground, not fly. This is against nature."

Yongpal, sitting beside him, muttered, "Master, stop saying nonsense and relax. I’m an airborne troop. If anything happens, I’ll jump with you. Don’t worry."

"That’s even more worrying. With your size, would the parachute even open? It’d probably snap."

"Master, that’s an insult. If you say that abroad, you’ll get arrested."

"Stop talking nonsense. Like foreigners would understand Korean."

Being quite large, Yongpal occupied two seats by himself.

Amused by their bickering, Lee Chang-jin reassured Master Shin with a smile.

"Don’t worry, Master. The chance of a plane crash is much lower than a traffic accident on land. By the way, Manager Koo, did you check the cargo?"

Manager Koo, sitting next to him, answered confidently, "Of course. Everything’s taken care of. Thanks to you, Boss, I’m having a great time."

"Haha. You’ll be flying often, so get used to it. Did everyone use the restroom?"

"Yes, Boss. No problems."

"Haha. We’ll be taking off soon. Get ready. We’re almost there."

As Lee Chang-jin checked his watch, a low announcement sound filled the cabin.

"Attention passengers. The plane will be taking off soon. Please fasten your seatbelts."

Shortly after, the plane’s engines roared to life as it began its takeoff.

With his eyes tightly shut, Master Shin sat beside an excited Seo Yohan, who exclaimed, "We’re up! We’re flying!"

After a 13-hour flight, the plane landed at Frankfurt Airport. Having completed the immigration process, Lee Chang-jin and his team took a rental car waiting near Düsseldorf Central Station and headed to the north gate of the exhibition hall.
