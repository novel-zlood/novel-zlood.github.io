## Episode 45: A Complete Transformation

The next day, Lee Chang-jin went to work as usual.

He spent the day handling backlogged tasks from the past few weeks and continued a development strategy meeting to convert small vacuum dryers for either food or household use. Yeo Jin-joo presented her report.

"After reviewing the order specifications from France's Picard, they require a voltage of 110V. The power frequency is 50Hz, and they want one unit each in basic sizes of large, medium, and small. The interior should be made of 1mm stainless steel with a ceramic coating, and the exterior should be 1.5mm cold-rolled steel with a paintable surface and thin fire-resistant material. They prefer a double structure with a thickness of less than 50mm that can be used at temperatures above 300 degrees Celsius from room temperature. Additionally, they request a dual-layer reinforced glass material that allows visual monitoring of the drying process. A log-type control panel timer and an over-temperature prevention device are essential. The production and delivery deadline is 6 months."

Gu Chang-dong grumbled as if it were absurd after hearing the report.

"Geez, last time they made it seem like they would place an order immediately. Why are their specifications so stringent? They say the French are the Chinese of Europe, and it's not entirely wrong."

"Haha, there's no need to think about it so harshly, Manager Gu. Business always requires detailed conditions to be properly established. But six months... It's a bit tight if we need to complete the UL certification and patent registration."

"I agree. To meet the client's production specs, we'll need additional technical research staff. However, we don't have the right personnel to support this."

Seo Yohan added.

"That's not the only problem. We're currently short on storage space. Although we've repurposed the Mapo factory into a warehouse, it's already overwhelmed just handling the crane and gear inventory. To expand the business, we'll need at least twice the current space."

"How long has it been since we moved the factory, and we're already facing this issue?"

"Well, due to a recent incident at Mido, we received 40% of the new orders, doubling our initial crane order expectations. We thought to seize the opportunity, but we underestimated our capability. I'm sorry, President."

"No need to apologize. It's a result of hard work... We'll need to look into the logistics warehouse separately. Manager Gu, I'll leave that to you."

"Yes, understood. Leave it to me."

"And regarding the hiring of research staff, since our internal research infrastructure is not yet equipped, we plan to put it on hold temporarily. I found out that Anyang Steel had some collaborative research experience with Korea University for their high-temperature dryer development. Although they didn't achieve their initial goals, they have substantial data. It might be a good idea to outsource the research to Korea University."

Seo Yohan tilted his head in doubt.

"Outsourcing to a team that previously failed, isn't that a bit questionable? Can they complete the development within the tight deadline?"

"Anyway, recruiting and developing internally would be too costly and time-consuming. The university, having failed once, will likely strive to make up for their mistakes this time. Moreover, establishing a cooperative relationship with the university will allow us to receive academic-industry cooperation grants, significantly reducing development costs. The head of the Electrical Engineering Department at Korea University, Professor Uhm Ki-dong, is an acquaintance of mine. I'll visit him to discuss this. Ah, Yeo Jin-joo, please look into the required documents for the industrial cooperation grant submission. Seo Ban-jang and Lee Ban-jang, please continue to oversee the production of gears and cranes as usual. This concludes the meeting."

"Yes, we will implement your instructions immediately."

In fact, Professor Uhm Ki-dong of Korea University was the brother of Manager Uhm Ki-jun of Anyang Steel. For Uhm Ki-dong, whose academic standing had been compromised due to previous research failures, this proposal was a welcome opportunity.

Thus, a support team was formed, comprising Anyang Steel, Daese Industries, and Korea University.

Research and development funds were to be provided by Anyang Steel and the government, while Daese Industries would oversee the production of prototypes and support research services. However, a condition was set that 3% of the profits would be paid as royalties to Anyang and the government upon revenue generation.

The increase wasn't limited to crane orders. The booming success of Cheongwoo Motors' new car model led to a surge in gear orders as well.

Days flew by in a flurry of activity. Lee Chang-jin, who was practically living at the office, had set up a makeshift bed in a corner of his office to handle the workload.

One day, as Lee Chang-jin was sound asleep on his makeshift bed, Yeo Jin-joo shook him awake.

"President, you have a call."

"Uh... What is it?"

"It's your brother. Dong-geun, he says."

"Oh, really? Please put him through."

Rubbing his eyes, Lee Chang-jin answered the call, hearing an excited and elated voice.

"Hyung, I passed the inspector exam!"

"Oh, congratulations. Your hard work paid off."

"I've also completed the business plan as you suggested. I'd like to show it to you now. Should I come over?"

"No need for that. Why don't you come to the Central Theater in Myeong-dong? I'll wait for you there."

Lee Chang-jin quickly got up and made a call to somewhere.

After a quick shower, he got dressed for going out.

"Assistant Yeo, please take care of the office for a while. I need to get some fresh air."

"Understood. Have a good time."

After finishing his conversation, Lee Chang-jin started his car. When he arrived at the Central Theater in Myeong-dong, Lee Dong-geun was waiting with a thick envelope, dressed in a plain shirt.

"Hyung, it's been a while. You haven't been home lately. Are you eating well? You look a bit thin."

"Thanks for worrying. I've been too busy to go home. But congratulations. Did you get your certificate?"

"Yes, here it is."

Dong-geun proudly showed his certificate, which had his examination number and the title "First-Class Inspector" with the stamp of the Korean Poultry Association.

A First-Class Inspector can identify over 97 chicks out of 100 in less than 9 minutes.

"Wow, that's impressive! You've only attended the academy for a few months and already got your certificate?"

Considering the tight schedule, it was an outstanding achievement.

Feeling proud, Dong-geun modestly shared more.

"I'm still lacking in skills, so I didn't get the Advanced Inspector certification. For that, you need to identify over 98 chicks in less than 7 minutes. To be honest, it's hard to get a job with just a First-Class Inspector certification. I need to keep training to refine my skills."

"I did some research. It takes about 2 to 4 years, right? But still, you passed the first test. That's commendable. So, did you bring the business plan?"

"Yes, it's here."

Lee Chang-jin nodded, looking at the envelope. Although Dong-geun had dressed up for the occasion, his long hair and the way his shirt collar was turned out made him look quite unsophisticated. Noticing Lee Chang-jin's scrutinizing gaze, Dong-geun asked curiously.

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

"Hmm... I have someone to introduce you to. But you can't go like this... Do you have a suit?"

"I do, but it's my dad's old suit, so it's a bit worn out. Should I go change?"

"No, since you're here, let's buy a suit."

"Oh no, that's too much. How can I accept that? I've already received so much from you."

"Nonsense. You passed an important exam, and I can't just let it go. Let's get you a suit."

"No, what you've done for me is more than enough..."

"Don't refuse. Come on."

Dragging a reluctant Dong-geun, Lee Chang-jin headed to the men's clothing section of the Terra Department Store in Myeong-dong.

A neatly dressed female employee greeted Lee Chang-jin with a bow.

"How can I help you, sir?"

"I'm looking for a suit. Do you have any good ones? I need a summer suit for this gentleman here."

"Do you have any preferred colors or designs?"

"Something plain like navy blue or black, without checks or stripes, and a snug fit. Two-button, with narrow lapels. No shoulder pads, just a natural silhouette."

"Ah, you're looking for a Continental Look. Please come this way."

After taking his measurements, Dong-geun tried on several suits. With his broad and sturdy shoulders from farm work, he looked quite imposing. Trying on a suit for the first time, Dong-geun stood awkwardly.

"This feels really uncomfortable. What if it tears? It feels like it'll burst with any movement."

"Haha, it's not that fragile. Stand straight and walk confidently."

Lee Chang-jin adjusted his tie and looked at him. Dressed in a suit with matching black shoes, Dong-geun gave an awkward smile.

While he looked more presentable, something still seemed off.

Noticing his long hair, Lee Chang-jin checked his watch.

"A man's hair is crucial. We still have time, so let's get your hair done."

"Really? I think it's fine..."

"I don't. Let's get rid of that shaggy hair and get you looking sharp."

Next, Lee Chang-jin took him to Jongno Hair, his regular hair salon since his Mannheim days. Inside, a hair designer who seemed around Lee Chang-jin's age greeted him warmly.

"Oh, Mr. Lee! Long time no see! Haven't seen you around lately."

"Haha, Ms. Mi-seon, I've been busy. Sorry for not visiting often."

"No worries. I heard your business is doing well. I'm envious. When will I get to go independent?"

"Haha, with your skills, you have plenty of opportunities. Plus, it's a family business, right? No need to go independent."

"True, but I still want my own place. It's every employee's dream to become a boss."

"Haha, then call me first. I'll bring my company staff to the opening event."

"Oh my, thank you! But who's this with you today? He looks a lot like you. Is he a relative?"

"Yes, he's my cousin. Introduce yourself. This is Ms. Mi-seon, my exclusive hair designer."

"Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Dong-geun."

"Your accent is quite charming. You have a lot of hair. When was the last time you had it cut?"

"Uh... it's been a few months."

"What did you do in the meantime? You must have cut it some time."

"My friends and I cut each other's hair when it got too long."

"Really? Is this your first time in a salon, then?"

"Yes... it's my first time."

"Wow, a real-life fossil! Is that true?"

Blushing, Dong-geun didn't know what to do, so Lee Chang-jin laughed and defended him.

"He grew up in the countryside, so he's quite naive. Please take good care of him."

"That's my specialty! Don't worry. Let's start with a shampoo."

Seated, Dong-geun took a deep breath, nervous about the sound of the scissors. As the scissors snipped, clumps of hair fell.

Skillfully trimming his hair, the hair designer shampooed it again. Lastly, she trimmed the sideburns and applied a bit of pomade, making him look quite stylish.

"Just thinning it out made a huge difference. How do you like it?"

"Is this really me?"

Looking in the mirror in disbelief, Dong-geun's reaction made Lee Chang-jin chuckle.

He seemed amazed at his transformed appearance.

Lee Chang-jin nodded in satisfaction.

"Much better. As expected from Ms. Mi-seon."

"It's not much. With a good base, anyone can look good."

Feeling good about the haircut, Lee Chang-jin took out his wallet.

At the counter, Ms. Mi-seon had something to say.

"Mr. Lee, you gave too much."

"The rest is a tip. I'll come again soon."

"Oh, thank you. Please come again."

With everything ready, Lee Chang-jin headed straight to Shinil Bank's Myeong-dong branch.
