## Episode 100: Reconstruction Project

That evening, 『Hanseong Daily』.

"Explosion of a Powder Train... Major Disaster at Iri Station. 60 Dead or Missing, Over a Thousand Injured"

"Around 9:15 PM yesterday, a Daewoong Explosives freight train waiting on the down track at Iri Station in North Jeolla Province exploded, killing 51 people and leaving 9 missing, while over a thousand people were either seriously or lightly injured.

The 24 tons of explosives loaded on the train at the time of the accident had about one-eight-hundredth of the destructive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, equivalent to the amount that could be dropped by six B29 bombers or three F4 Phantom jets.

Due to the explosion, 675 houses within a 1km radius, including the Iri Station building, were completely destroyed, 1,289 houses were partially destroyed, and windows of about 7,500 houses were shattered, among other damages.

Additionally, due to the blast and flames caused by the explosion, 10 cargo train cars were completely burned, and a total of over 30 cars were overturned or destroyed, disrupting traffic on the Honam Line and Jeolla Line, which were barely restored around 12 PM today. Furthermore, the entire city of Iri experienced a blackout for 5 hours immediately after the accident, causing chaos, and the estimated property damage to houses alone is said to exceed 5.1 billion won.

In response, the National Assembly's Budget and Accounts Committee reported that it plans to form an investigation team to identify the cause and assess the damage on-site by the end of the day.

“The Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters plans to send an investigation team to the site to accurately assess the actual damage situation. Additionally, a separate investigation team will be dispatched to identify the exact cause of the accident, led by the Chief Prosecutor and composed of high-ranking officials from the Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency.”

Prime Minister Ha Jae-gyu expressed deep condolences to the families of those who died in the explosion and promised to ensure the best possible treatment for the injured. He also mentioned that the President promised to do his utmost in the recovery efforts and urged the public to come together with compassion and determination to aid in the recovery.

Around the same time, at the office of Park Man-je, a former three-term congressman from the opposition party, discussions were being held regarding countermeasures related to the Iri Station explosion.

“This is indeed a major issue. The damage from the explosion seems extraordinary.”

“It’s quite unfortunate that such a disaster occurred with just a year left before the election. Shouldn't we call the government officials to expedite the supplementary budget?”

While the former aides were discussing the matter, Park Man-je, reclining on the sofa, wore an indifferent expression.

“Hey, just leave it alone. Even if we push for a recovery using the current government budget, it’s not like the credit will come to me. It will only boost the incumbent’s achievements. Why should we cook the food only to give it to someone else?”

“But there are thousands of displaced people. Leaving the situation as it is...”

“Those rural people don’t even pay taxes properly. What compensation? Don’t make me laugh.”

The aides fell silent at Park Man-je's cynical attitude. One of the junior secretaries, feeling uncomfortable, cautiously spoke.

“But shouldn't we at least pretend to help? Everyone knows you're going to run in the next election from Iksan. If you remain passive, it could hurt your image...”

Park Man-je scoffed in disbelief.

“You naive person, just act like you care when the reporters come. Why the need to make a fuss now? Even if we talk about supplementary budget allocation now, do you think it will be properly assigned? Besides, when the cause of the accident is suspected to be an accident, who will agree to the government covering all the recovery costs? With the current budget issues, who will be happy about it? The funds will have to be taken from somewhere else anyway.”

“So, you’re saying there’s no benefit in acting now, so we should just wait and see?”

Park Man-je nodded at the murmuring reactions of his aides.

“The National Assembly will argue and fight over it anyway, so let's wait and see. It will take time for the recovery budget to be allocated, so we can claim it after the election. Moreover, the current mayor is a strong candidate from the ruling party for the election, right? If he gets labeled as an incompetent mayor who couldn't secure timely funds, what do you think the election results will be?”

“I hadn't thought that far.”

“Exactly. Let’s use this opportunity to frame him as incompetent and get rid of him. Inform the central party to drag out the supplementary budget schedule.”

It seemed like a plausible strategy.

If the recovery support funds were not received in time, the residents’ complaints would undoubtedly grow.

Given the regional characteristics that favor the opposition, victory would be almost certain.

The impressed aides flattered him in unison.

“No one can match Congressman Park’s insight.”

“Indeed, your foresight is incredible.”

Park Man-je, basking in the flattery, spoke arrogantly.

“This is how you use your brain. Do you think I went to study at New York University for nothing? By the way, when the accident happened, Jung Moon-hak wasn’t around, right? Did you check where he was?”

“Yes. He was reportedly dining with a businessman while returning from a visit to the central party headquarters.”

Park Man-je clapped his hands in satisfaction.

“That’s great. The mayor didn’t even know about the accident and was having a daytime drink. Spread that to the reporters. He’ll get a lot of flak for it.”

"Four Hours of Gap in the Iri Station Explosion, Negligence or Abandonment?"

As the intentionally crafted article spread, the Iri City Hall’s phone lines were flooded.

“No, there’s no collusion between politics and business. We’ve never done anything like that.”

“There was no preferential treatment. Lobbying? Nothing of that sort happened. We just had a meal for business purposes, that’s all.”

The City Hall was sweating bullets trying to explain the continuous complaints. As the controversy grew beyond expectations, the incumbent mayor of Iri submitted a resignation letter, taking moral responsibility for the Iri Station explosion.

Fortunately, due to the effective handling of duties by Governor Kim, who took over, the controversy soon subsided, but the real problem came next.

Talking with the governor about the disaster recovery, Governor Kim's voice rose involuntarily.

“What do you mean you can’t provide the disaster support funds immediately? What kind of nonsense is that?”

“Whoa, listen to me till the end. I'm not saying we won’t give it, just that it might be delayed. The cause of the incident hasn’t been identified yet, and the opposition lawmakers are being uncooperative. Besides, things have become a bit complicated.”

“What exactly is the problem?”

“Well, there’s a dispute over the budget range for the recovery. The opposition claims that even if the explosion caused damage, it’s difficult to compensate if the place of residence is an unauthorized building. They insist on excluding temporary buildings or greenhouses that aren’t registered as property from compensation. Naturally, our side opposes this. Hence, the discussion is dragging on.”

Hearing the whole story, Governor Kim was dumbfounded.

“Governor, in rural areas like ours, how many buildings are properly authorized? Besides, speed is crucial for recovery support. How long are we supposed to wait?”

“Who knows, the opposition is holding us back on this issue, it’s a headache. There are many other issues to deal with as well. Besides, public opinion isn’t favorable right now.”

“Governor, this is unacceptable. How am I supposed to handle the recovery without financial support? We have emergency recovery funds, disaster countermeasures funds from each ministry, and even contingency reserves, don’t we? How can none of these be allocated?”

“The government says it’s difficult to reallocate funds according to the Ministry of Home Affairs regulations. What can I do? One side says we can’t reallocate the budget, and the other says they can’t provide without authorization. I’m sorry. I have to go; my schedule is tight.”

“Governor! Governor!!”

Beep, beep.

The phone line went dead. Despite repeated attempts to reconnect, the governor didn’t answer, leaving Governor Kim fuming as he threw the phone away.

“Damn it!”

While the governor was stewing in anger, Lee Chang-jin continued the recovery work with the village men. Koo Chang-dong and Director Seo had dispatched heavy equipment operators to the site.

Approaching Koo Chang-dong, who was engrossed in land work, Lee Chang-jin asked.

“How’s the work progressing?”

“There’s minimal explosion damage in the outer areas. Apart from debris from the explosion causing soot damage, it’s relatively intact. We’ve repainted and wallpapered, and restored the water supply. Residents can move in from tomorrow.”

“Good. Did you take photos before the restoration?”

“Yes.”

“Well done. We’ll need those for claiming compensation or insurance later. Don’t forget to take site photos, even if it’s a hassle.”

“Understood.”

As the governor emerged from the county office, Lee Chang-jin quickly removed his work gloves.

“You’re working hard. Mr. Lee, do you have a moment?”

“Yes. We’ve just about finished the morning work.”

“Shall we have a cigarette?”

Lee Chang-jin didn’t refuse. Looking at the burnt debris in the market area and downtown, Governor Kim sighed. Sensing the governor’s silent demeanor, Lee Chang-jin guessed the situation.

“From your expression, it seems the supplementary budget issue hasn’t been resolved.”

“Is it that obvious?”

“Yes... very much so.”

“I can’t even fool a ghost, let alone you.”

Governor Kim stubbed out his half-smoked cigarette.

“They talk about billions in support, but their actions... I’m ashamed to face you. I’ll ensure the construction costs for temporary buildings and labor are paid as quickly as possible with county funds.”

Lee Chang-jin waved his hand as if to say not to worry.

“Don’t worry about that. We can handle the construction costs indirectly if needed. But not receiving the supplementary budget is a big problem. Won’t the recovery be delayed too much?”

“Exactly, we should start the recovery immediately, but those above are busy squabbling.”

Seeing the governor’s frustration, Lee Chang-jin comforted him.

“No amount of thinking will produce money. Let’s have a meal first and then think about it.”

Despite the explosion, the village hall remained intact and was now being used as a shelter and temporary dining area for the displaced residents. As they filled their trays with food and sat down, a comedy program featuring the top comedians Gu Seon-bong and Bae Yong-chul started airing on TV. Despite the dire circumstances, people laughed at the slapstick comedy.

Seeing this, Director Seo remarked sarcastically.

“Seriously, the village is in shambles, and they have the nerve to watch TV?”

“Ah, you’re so harsh. That show is actually quite funny. What else do they have to look forward to without a TV, when their houses are gone?”

Koo Chang-dong, who was gobbling down cabbage soup, defended them.

“People are like that. If it were me, I’d be too depressed to do anything.”

“Maybe so. Even when it feels like the world is collapsing, everyone seems to eat just fine.”

Thankfully, there were no cases of depression among the residents.

Then, an idea suddenly struck Lee Chang-jin, who was watching TV.

“I just had a thought, why don’t we use the media?”

“The media? What do you mean?”

Governor Kim, who had been eating rice soaked in water due to lack of appetite, paused his spoon, showing interest.

Lee Chang-jin explained.

“I was thinking, how about making a documentary about this incident? Instead of waiting idly for the disaster support funds, wouldn’t it be faster to raise public donations?”

“Hmm, it sounds like a good idea... but is it feasible?”

Governor Kim showed interest but also appeared concerned. If they spent money on TV ads without gaining any results, it would be a waste of money. Lee Chang-jin spoke firmly.

“Do we have any better options? At least we should try. If you approve, I’ll contact the reporters to see if it’s possible.”

“Alright. I’ll give you full authority. Do as you see fit.”

Although initially hesitant, Governor Kim eventually agreed. There seemed to be no other viable method to secure recovery funds.

Upon contacting 『Kyeongwoon Daily』, reporter Joo Young-mi, who was working indoors, happily answered the call.
