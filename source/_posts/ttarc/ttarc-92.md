## Episode 92: Taeyang Chemicals

Kim Goon-soo, whom Lee Chang-jin hadn't seen in a long time, warmly welcomed his visit.

"What brings you here, President Lee?"

"Have you been well, Governor? I'm sorry I haven't been in touch."

"No, you're a busy man, and yet you came all the way here... I'm the one who's grateful. But what brings you here?"

"Actually... it's like this."

When Lee Chang-jin explained the situation and asked for help, the governor nodded as he listened.

"If it's about that, I should help. The mayor of Ulsan is an old friend from our administrative training days. I'll have a word with him, so go see him tomorrow. Oh, and don't forget to bring a bottle of liquor when you visit; he's quite the drinker."

Two days later, a private meeting with the mayor of Ulsan was arranged.

When Lee Chang-jin met the mayor, he bowed politely.

"Hello, Mayor Chun? Thank you for sparing some time despite your busy schedule."

"Haha, nice to meet you. You must be President Lee Chang-jin? I received a message from Governor Kim. I heard you're in business. Do you have any specific plans for this area?"

"If the opportunity arises, I do have some thoughts. But unfortunately, I'm here for a different matter today."

"Oh, what is it about?"

"Actually, I'm planning to establish a chemical plant and need a sample business plan. So, I was wondering if I could get some documents related to the permit application for the Mirae Chemicals naphthalene plant currently operating in Ulsan?"

After listening to Lee Chang-jin's explanation, the mayor of Ulsan tilted his head, looking conflicted.

"I understand your situation. However, I can't just disclose corporate secrets recklessly... there are regulations I must adhere to as the mayor."

Sensing the hesitation, Lee Chang-jin presented a bottle of liquor he had prepared.

"Oh, I almost forgot. I brought a gift. I heard you enjoy a good drink, so I prepared a modest bottle. This is a token of my sincerity."

"Oh, hmm. You didn't have to bring anything..."

The mayor's face brightened immediately, and he cleared his throat.

What Lee Chang-jin brought was a bottle of Royal Salute 32-Year-Old.

This Scotch whisky was produced to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and became a symbol of luxury in Korea after President Park Hee-chan gifted it to cabinet ministers.

Naturally, the mayor, known for his love of liquor, was delighted.

The mayor subtly checked the bag and was startled to find a check inside.

"What is this?"

"I heard many people are struggling without heating this winter. I thought about what I could do to help and brought a small donation for the city to use in aiding those in need. I'll leave the specifics to your judgment."

The mayor, after discreetly checking the amount in the envelope, smiled contentedly.

Moved by the legitimate "bribe," he immediately called the head of the Industrial Support Department.

"Manager Lee!"

"Yes, Mayor."

"Go get the documents for the chemical plant."

"What do you mean?"

"The permit application documents for the Mirae Chemicals naphthalene plant in the city. Bring all related documents. I want to check if there are any violations regarding hazardous substance emissions."

While Lee Chang-jin and the mayor had tea.

Shortly after, the head of the Industrial Support Department returned from the archive with a pile of documents.

"Mayor, here are the documents you requested."

"Good, leave them here. Oh, Manager Lee?"

"Yes, Mayor."

The mayor handed over the envelope of money with practiced ease.

"This is a token of appreciation. It's been tough lately, so have a meal with your staff."

"You didn't have to... Thank you."

As the head of the department, looking pleasantly surprised, expressed gratitude and left, the mayor placed the documents prominently on the office table.

"Hmm, I seem to have skipped breakfast. How about an early lunch? There's a good Korean restaurant not far from City Hall..."

Lee Chang-jin, quick to catch on, agreed.

"That sounds great. I was getting hungry myself."

While Lee Chang-jin entertained the mayor at the Korean restaurant, his companion Yeon Jin-joo took the documents from the secretary and stepped outside.

The filming team meticulously compared and photographed each document.

Of course, they returned the files exactly as they found them after use.

A few days later, at Daese Construction's office in Seodaemun District.

Having secured the reference materials, Lee Chang-jin convened a practical meeting.

"Let's start the meeting on the establishment of the titanium dioxide plant. Director Yoon, please provide details on the necessary facilities and area."

"Yes. Upon review, the plant site has secured a minimum of 30,000 pyeong, with a floor area ratio of 40%, making the usable area about 13,000 pyeong. Initially, about 5,000 pyeong of this area will be used for administrative buildings, control rooms, main process facilities, and auxiliary facilities. The remaining site will sequentially install four large 200-horsepower dry fans for the dry process, two 300-horsepower milling equipment for the grinding process, three pumps for industrial water supply, fire protection facilities, raw water storage tanks, chemical injection facilities, and silos. Additionally, two emergency generators will be brought in to prepare for power outages."

Lee Chang-jin asked Director Yoon again.

"How do you plan to procure the related facilities and major equipment?"

"Yes. We will divide the work into design and procurement sections. It's best to purchase the main equipment after obtaining the permits. We plan to import the dry fans and grinding process equipment through Itochu Corporation in Japan, and we can supply the industrial pumps in-house. I recommend using Siemens products for the silos and chemical injection equipment, as they are more reliable in terms of durability and other aspects."

Listening to the discussion, Lee Chang-jin turned his attention to Counselor Hong.

"Good. Counselor Hong, can we remodel the existing building in Bupyeong for the plant?"

"That might be difficult. The remaining buildings are over 40 years old, so it would be challenging to use them as-is, except perhaps as residences or warehouses."

Nodding at the expected response, Lee Chang-jin agreed.

"Then we'll have to demolish the existing buildings and start with the plant expansion. Let's include this in the master plan. Is there anything else that might be a concern?"

Counselor Hong In-young, after a brief consideration, responded.

"The main issue is how Taeyang Chemicals will react. To obtain approval for establishing a chemical plant, we must submit an application to the relevant district office and undergo a complex review process as per Article 6 of the Enforcement Decree of the Hazardous Materials Safety Control Act. Only after passing the review can we receive a plant establishment approval and proceed with civil and construction permits. The problem is that Taeyang Group has significant influence in Bupyeong and Namdong Industrial Complex in Incheon... I expect they will definitely interfere with the review process."

Taeyang Chemicals is currently the only company in Korea producing titanium dioxide independently.

No company would idly stand by and watch a competitor emerge, especially if its president is not a fool.

It was clear that they would interfere.

Lee Chang-jin, having experienced numerous underhanded and absurd interferences in his previous life, fully agreed with Counselor Hong's opinion.

"I think so too. At this stage, we can't predict what tricks they might pull, so we should thoroughly prepare for the review. As Counselor Hong said, passing the review is our priority, so please actively gather information about the reviewers."

"Yes, understood."

A few days later, in the meeting room, Counselor Hong, having utilized his network to the fullest, presented the information he had gathered.

"From my investigation, most of the experts on the Incheon City review committee are professors from Bupyeong University and Songdo University. About one-third of them are closely associated with Taeyang Chemicals. Among them, the experts in environmental, chemical engineering, and civil structure fields are reportedly appointed by Taeyang Chemicals."

"As expected of Taeyang Group. They even have influence over the reviewers... There's no place where their influence doesn't reach."

The staff silently agreed with Gu Chang-dong's grumbling.

Taeyang Group was always present wherever money flowed. Their traditional business method was to get involved in profitable areas first and then kick the ladder away.

Director Seo also had something to add.

"Don't worry too much. There's no need to be afraid before we even start. Our immediate task is to persuade the remaining members to our side. Our priority is to secure support from reviewers who might favor the plant establishment."

Lee Chang-jin also fully agreed with that point.

"Exactly. I'll handle the mechanical and electrical experts. Counselor Hong, please take charge of civil and architectural experts. Director Seo, please handle the public officials in charge of permits at the district office. Professor Kim Hak-do, please assist as a pinch hitter. Let's contact the experts separately by category and discuss the results based on that."

Professor Kim Hak-do, now on Lee Chang-jin's side, nodded.

"Alright, I'll find out the names, details, and contact information of the designated experts."

Having completed the paperwork, Lee Chang-jin received a land use consent form with a clause stating that the balance would be paid within three months after obtaining the plant establishment permit.

He then submitted the application with the business plan attached to the Bupyeong District Office.

* * *

Less than three days after submitting the documents, the news quickly reached Taeyang Chemicals.

President Nam Tae-hoon's face twisted like a demon upon reading the report.

"A titanium dioxide plant is going to be established in Bupyeong? What are you talking about?"

"Yes. We received an urgent message from the Incheon City's industrial department that a chemical plant establishment plan was submitted two days ago."

"Seriously, how is that possible? Where are they getting the raw materials?"

"From Mexico. According to the plan, they have an annual export agreement for 20,000 tons."

"What the hell? Why did this competitor suddenly appear?"

For Nam Tae-hoon, it was an utterly baffling situation. When he became the president of Taeyang Chemicals, he believed he was entering a monopoly market with no competitors and only had to reap the benefits.

Just as the business was getting on track, a competitor suddenly appeared... It was indeed unwelcome news.

"Did you secure their business plan? If it's a new company, they have no experience in setting up a plant, right? Is there nothing we can nitpick?"

"Well, it seems they will pass the review without any issues. There are no legal problems, and the equipment requirements are 120% met. They appear to have prepared thoroughly."

Considering they had referred to the plans of Mirae Chemicals, known for its 50-year accident-free operation, it would be strange if they didn't pass.

An angry Nam Tae-hoon roughly loosened his tie.

"Ah, this is driving me crazy. How can this happen?"

"What should we do, President? We can't just let this go."

"Get the hotline connected. I need to see my brother immediately."

In a rush, Nam Tae-hoon decided to seek help from higher up.

He judged that it was beyond his capacity to stop this at his level since the plan had already been submitted.

The next day, Nam Tae-hoon visited the Future Strategy Office at the headquarters of Taeyang Group.
