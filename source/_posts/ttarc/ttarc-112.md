## Episode 112: Military Uniform Sample

Jung Ho-sung greeted Lee Chang-jin with a slurred voice.

"What's up, brother? I thought you'd look gaunt after going to the Middle East, but you look better than I expected."

"You're looking plumper. Must be nice working in Korea with air conditioning while everyone else is suffering on business trips."

"Hey, President Lee, why so sharp? A weakling like me would just die if I went there. By the way, did you only work out in the Middle East? Why do you look so buff? Planning to enter a bodybuilding competition?"

"Just did some digging under the scorching sun. And Seon-ah sent me some herbal medicine, so I had a hard time sweating it out every night."

"Wow, getting herbal medicine from your girlfriend. I'm jealous. But aren't you a bit rude? Rubbing it in my face?"

"If you're dissatisfied, why don't you date someone? You have the capability, so why are you still single?"

"Maybe because the exploitative boss works me to the bone without rest? Isn't that right?"

"Is that so? Then you must have done the work properly. Since time is tight, shall we start with the business report, Manager Jung?"

"Understood, Mr. President. I will prepare as instructed."

After a brief reunion, Lee Chang-jin immediately convened a strategic meeting. Jung Ho-sung, who had obtained the offer documents for the UAE's Request For Quotation (RFQ), began the briefing.

"According to the investigation on the UAE Ministry of Defense's military uniform import status, it is true that contracts are being held off. However, it seems that the rejection of Taeyang's proposal was not solely due to claim issues."

"Then what is the problem?"

"It seems to be a fundamental issue. The UAE wants more practical and upgraded uniforms compared to those supplied to Saudi Arabia."

The main obstacle was Saqr bin Muhammad, who ruled Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah, one of the emirates. Having experienced wars with Iran and Britain, he was extremely sensitive about the functionality of military supplies, especially uniforms.

However, Taeyang Group found it difficult to meet the RFQ conditions required by the UAE. To do so, they would have to produce higher-quality uniforms than those initially contracted with Saudi Arabia, which would inevitably lead to claims from Saudi Arabia, putting Taeyang in a difficult position.

"Hmm, what exactly does the UAE want in terms of specs?"

"They want products with the Bezold effect, specifically Duck Hunter (spot pattern) designs."

Modern military uniforms prioritize concealment over defense, unlike in the medieval era. Since getting shot means death regardless, the main goal is to increase the wearer's chances of survival by making them less visible to the enemy.

Thus, the concept of making camouflage patterns as fine as possible to enhance concealment like a chameleon came about. The Bezold effect was a concrete theoretical foundation for this.

However, there was a problem. It was extremely difficult to produce a camouflage pattern that balanced practicality and aesthetics.

"To make matters worse, the current Minister of Defense in charge of importing these uniforms is quite interested in design, having graduated from a renowned design school in the UK. Hence, the stringent requirements."

"A harmony of design and practicality. That's a tough order..."

Lee Chang-jin leaned on his chin, lost in deep thought. The balance of functionality and fashion was a challenging issue even for someone confident in technology like him.

At that moment, Lee Chang-jin suddenly thought of someone.

Perhaps Kim Bong-su might have a solution?

If it's Korea's top designer, Kimmae, maybe there's a way.

Taking out his wallet, he found Kim Bong-su's business card with his studio address on the back.

* * *

Dosan-daero, Sinsa-dong.

While the main store in Samcheong-dong was popular among middle-aged figures from the political and financial circles, the second store in Gangnam was frequented by famous celebrities and the younger generation.

As Lee Chang-jin arrived at the boutique with Jin Seon-ah and looked around, he remarked.

"Your business seems to be doing well. Already a second shop."

"You didn't know? The last fashion show was a huge hit, and he bought another building."

"Wow, that's impressive."

"He's a star in the fashion world. Shall we go in?"

As they stepped into the boutique, a faint rose fragrance wafted with the clean air.

A captivating scent that penetrated the heart. As they passed through the boutique lined with red carpet, a female employee with cherry-red lips greeted them.

"Oh my, Chief Jin! How long has it been?"

"Indeed. How have you been, Yeji?"

Yeji, the staff member, replied with a bright smile.

"I've been great as always. But why has it been so long? I was curious if something was up..."

"I've been busy with work lately. I'm a bit late, aren't I?"

"Just visiting us is appreciated. Moreover, you're getting more beautiful. I want to be like you, Chief."

"What are you talking about? You're plenty pretty, Yeji."

"Thank you for saying that. But you have company today?"

With the staff's interest marked by a question mark, Lee Chang-jin greeted.

"I'm Lee Chang-jin. Nice to meet you."

"Oh! So you're the one. The young businessman everyone talks about these days, right?"

"Oh, you know me?"

"Yes! You were at the fashion show. I was in charge of coordinating that event."

"Oh, I'm sorry. I was too nervous to notice back then."

"It's okay. The teacher is inside, so I'll guide you. He'll be glad to see you."

Following the staff inside, they saw Kim Bong-su engrossed in fabric work.

Noticing their presence, Kim Bong-su looked up and, recognizing Lee Chang-jin, greeted him warmly.

"Oh my God! Look who it is. Isn't it Chang-jin?"

Lee Chang-jin also felt the warmth in Kim Bong-su's greeting.

"Long time no see, teacher."

"I heard about your desert plantation farm. What a fantastic idea. I was really impressed."

"Thank you."

"Come, sit. Miss Yu? Could you bring us some coffee? And some light refreshments as well."

"Sure."

Soon, coffee and light refreshments were brought to the reception room. Savoring the aroma, Lee Chang-jin remarked.

"Yirgacheffe. The aroma is nice."

"I drink it occasionally. There are times when I need the boost from caffeine while working. But what brings someone as busy as you here? There must be a reason."

"As expected, I can't fool you, teacher. I came to ask for your help."

"Oh, what is it? Now I'm curious."

"First, please take a look at these materials."

Lee Chang-jin took out documents from his briefcase. The booklet he opened contained photos of military uniforms and designs from various countries. Seeing the contents, Kim Bong-su looked at Lee Chang-jin with curiosity.

"Hmm, military uniforms? Are you asking me to design these?"

"Yes, that's right. I would like you to improve these uniforms based on the existing ones. Since they will be supplied to the Middle East, it would be appreciated if you could consider breathability and convenience for the desert environment."

However, Kim Bong-su did not seem pleased.

"Designing military uniforms is not really my thing. I fundamentally love peace and culture, you know."

"I understand. I know what kind of clothes you pursue. But maintaining peace is also the role of the military. Providing soldiers with more comfortable and better clothes can be considered a valuable endeavor, don’t you think? The design royalty will be guaranteed. Please."

"That's right, teacher. There's a saying that to prevent war, one must prepare for it. And uniforms are clothes, not weapons."

Jin Seon-ah, who was beside them, also supported Lee Chang-jin. Though Lee Chang-jin was quite eloquent, Kim Bong-su was also quite easily influenced. Succumbing to their persistent persuasion, Kim Bong-su unknowingly nodded his head.

"You have a point. Alright, but on one condition."

"What is it? If it's within my power, I'll do it."

"It's nothing major. Just promise to grant me one favor without question, just once. How about that? Easy, right?"

"Of course."

"Then promise me?"

"A man's word is his bond."

"Good. I'll trust you, President Lee. Then let's get to work, shall we? Give me just two weeks."

"Two weeks? Isn't that a bit tight to produce results?"

Kim Bong-su, slightly offended, raised his eyes.

"President Lee, are you underestimating me? I'm Kimmae. This much is enough time."

Despite his confidence, Lee Chang-jin was a bit worried but decided to trust him.

"Understood, teacher. Please contact me when it's finished."

While the prototype military uniforms were being made, Lee Chang-jin was busy catching up on delayed work. He met with miners to secure molybdenum supplies and received a report on the mining status from Manager Park Hee-seung.

About ten days later, there was a call from Kim's Atelier.

"President Lee, the products are ready."

"Already?"

When Lee Chang-jin returned to the boutique, he was shocked.

Kim Bong-su, looking gaunt with dark circles down to his chin, greeted him.

"Your face looks half its size. Are you feeling alright?"

Kim Bong-su replied with a weak smile.

"Ah, I stayed up several nights. I’m a bit out of it. But more importantly, take a look at this prototype."

The product Kim Bong-su made was a khaki military uniform suitable for the desert. When the male model, who had been waiting, wore the uniform and stood in front of a dirt-colored desert photo, it looked like only his head was floating.

"What do you think? I focused on concealment and made it as practical as possible. The material has infrared reflective properties."

"And this strap on the sleeve?"

"That's for emergency use in case of injury during combat. You can adjust the length of the sleeve and insert the attached strap into the shoulder button, turning it into an emergency splint."

When Kim Bong-su demonstrated, the clothes surprisingly turned into a splint.

Excited by Lee Chang-jin's interest, Kim Bong-su continued to explain.

"The combat pockets here on the front are designed for quick access during real operations. The belt is made without holes and is fixed with a buckle. Holes weaken the durability, you see."

Kim Bong-su even made an inner lining for cold weather to be used during guard duty or front-line service.

"Great work. How did you manage all this in such a short time? You've really outdone yourself."

Lee Chang-jin genuinely admired the work. Though he was worried about whether the product could be completed in two weeks, seeing the finished uniform, he understood why Kim Bong-su was called a genius.

Lee Chang-jin turned his gaze to the piled-up books behind the uniform.

The numerous books with densely labeled tags hinted at the effort involved.

"It's nothing. Now I need to catch up on some sleep. After pulling several all-nighters, I'm exhausted. I hope this sample brings good results. If President Lee fails to secure the order with this, I'll be sad."

"Don't worry. I'll definitely secure the order."

Brandon, who received the sample through international mail, couldn't hide his excitement.

After confirming the functionality and design of the product, Brandon confidently stated.

"Wow, this is overwhelming. We should be able to persuade the Ministry of Defense easily."

Now the remaining issue was whether they could handle the volume ordered by the UAE. Although Lee Chang-jin ran a textile company, the volume was too large for him to handle alone. Even if they subcontracted, continuous supply required a reliable manufacturing partner.

Additionally, there was the issue of meeting vendor qualifications. In the Middle East, it is standard practice to register as a vendor with the ordering institution before exporting. Only companies that have passed pre-qualification can supply export products to maintain quality.

From hiring a lawyer to translating and notarizing various documents, registering with the Chamber of Commerce, and opening accounts.

This process takes at least a year, so starting now, it was practically impossible.

Collaborating with an already registered vendor appeared to be the most advantageous solution.

Among several candidate companies, Lee Chang-jin had one in mind.

'Only Cheongwoo can handle this volume.'

Lee Chang-jin headed to Cheongwoo Industries' headquarters in Gwanghwamun.
