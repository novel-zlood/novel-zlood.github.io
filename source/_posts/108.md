“How can I help you?” 

It was an elderly gentleman wearing a fedora. 

“I came to see my daughter-in-law.” 

“Pardon?” 

The female employee at the gallery asked back, puzzled. Just then, another employee who recognized the elderly man’s face hurriedly ran out from the back and bowed. 

“Chairman, you’re here.” 

Upon hearing the word ‘Chairman,’ the employee who had initially responded slowly turned her head as if in slow motion. There stood Chairman Wang, smiling playfully. 

“Father, why didn’t you come with Secretary Choi?” 

“Tsk, I’m not a child. It’s not bad to come alone once in a while.” 

“Oh, Father. I bet the new employee’s heart must have skipped a beat. It’s fortunate that Mihyun recognized you quickly. Otherwise, you would have kept teasing the new employee, wouldn’t you?” 

Chairman Wang moved on without denying it. The gallery was filled with works from renowned artists. 

Chairman Wang stopped in front of a painting with a blue dot on a white canvas. 

“This would look good hanging in the entrance.” 

“Father, you have a good eye as always.” 

It was a piece worth tens of millions of won, but Chairman Wang picked it out like he was shopping at a local market. Since the gallery was under the Jeil Foundation, in a way, it was as good as Chairman Wang’s. 

“You want to take over the foundation?” 

“Yes, Father.” 

Chairman Wang was pleased with his daughter-in-law. Her ambition was significant. Taking over the Jeil Foundation was akin to getting a hold of Jeil Group’s financial lifeline. 

If she had a lot of greed but lacked ability, it would be shameless, but wasn’t she also exceptionally capable? If she were born a man, she would have played the role of a great man already. 

“You know that Hyun went to Seocho-dong today, right?” 

“Yes, Father. But why did you send Hyun to Seocho-dong?” 

“To judge what kind of person he is. There’s a big difference between knowing something in theory and facing it in reality.” 

Jeil Group had dozens of subsidiaries and countless employees. When faced with that reality, an ordinary person would freeze up and not be able to move. 

“I just got a call from Ilsun. Do you know where Hyun wanted to go first?” 

“The management planning department?” 

“If it were just that, I wouldn’t be surprised. He said he wanted to go to the strategic planning office.” 

Chairman Wang let out a pleased laugh. 

The strategic planning office was essentially the brain of Jeil Group. Within Jeil Group, it was a publicly secretive department. 

Indeed, what kind of figure would Kang Hyun show there? Chairman Wang was very curious. Just then, 

“Why is it so noisy?” 

Wasn’t that English coming from outside? Chairman Wang and Im Hyera moved outside together. 

There stood Kim Mihyun facing a white woman who looked like a model. 

* * * 

‘It’s been a while.’ 

Though old and faded, the structure was the same as in the past. From the construction to the internal structure of Jeil Group’s headquarters, there was no place untouched by Chairman Wang. 

Rumor had it that not only feng shui but also a renowned fortune-teller was involved in designing the department locations. 

Maybe that’s why, even with organizational restructuring, departments rarely moved. 

‘Hmm.’ 

If I walk past the left corner here, there should be the management support department, and climbing the stairs would bring me to the management planning team. 

In my past life, I was friendly with the general affairs staff. It was the corner where money came out, including welfare support. 

If you say the right words, changing an airplane seat from business to first class is a piece of cake. 

“Hyun, have you been here before?” 

Oops, I must have moved my steps excitedly, lost in old memories. President Son Ilsun looked at me with a puzzled expression. 

I shook my head slightly to cover it up and calmed my excited steps. But President Son Ilsun still seemed puzzled. By the way, 

‘The strategic planning office.’ 

Wasn’t it the place I so desperately wanted to visit in my past life? 

It was the most mysterious department within Jeil Group, akin to Area 51 in Nevada’s Mojave Desert. 

That’s because it was hard to see their faces often, and they didn’t even talk to other employees. 

Moreover, there were no new employees in the strategic planning office. 

Mostly comprised of experienced hires, it was a unique department with no entry-level positions. According to rumors within the company, an ordinary-looking potbellied uncle was a former colonel from the intelligence service, or that the strategic planning office was tightly controlled by people from the Federal Reserve Bank. 

It was similar to the rumor that there are aliens in Area 51. 

“It’s fortunate that the head of the planning office is giving a report today.” 

It was my first visit to the strategic planning office. I had a rough idea of where the department was located, but I had never peered inside. 

So I imagined it would be filled with high-tech equipment like in a sci-fi movie or that they would use AI and big data like the protagonist in Minority Report. 

But indeed, places where people live are all the same. Besides, it was still the '90s, wasn’t it? Still, 

‘It’s impressive.’ 

Even with President Son Ilsun’s visit, the strategic planning office remained busy. 

The employees’ ages were varied. If there was one thing in common, it was that their eyes were all extraordinary. 

Indeed, unless you were exceptionally talented, you wouldn’t even set foot in this place. 

“President, you’re here.” 

Seeing the head of the planning office bowing to President Son Ilsun, I struggled to contain my surprise. 

He was someone I knew too. Wasn’t he the person I often saw when I was preparing to run for the National Assembly under a three-term councilor in my past life? 

A man with a sharp jawline and piercing eyes. Why was I surprised? Because this man was the Prime Minister back then. 

“I will now speak about the future directions for Daehan and Daeseong Group, as well as the foreign companies listed in the prepared draft.” 

It seemed like an ordinary presentation scene. 

But the people sitting there were anything but ordinary. Including President Son Ilsun and several mysterious executives. 

The person presenting was none other than the head of the strategic planning office. 

Even though I, in my school uniform, was also seated, no one objected. Because I was with President Son Ilsun. 

‘Impressive.’ 

As the presentation went on, I kept marveling inwardly. I had heard the reputation of the strategic planning office countless times, but I didn’t know it was to this extent. 

They were predicting future scenarios as if they were fortune-telling, boldly discarding Daehan and Daeseong Group, which were at the top of the business rankings under the current and next governments. 

Moreover, their future assessments of foreign companies matched a significant portion of what I knew. 

“Hyun, what do you think? Do you think Chief Kim Sang-guk is entirely correct?” 

Then President Son Ilsun looked at me. All eyes in the meeting room focused on me. I knew why President Son Ilsun was asking me this question. 

Chief Kim Sang-guk, who was presenting, looked puzzled. How should I respond to this? 

“I don’t think it’s entirely correct. Let me first address the future assessments of foreign companies that the chief mentioned one by one. Regarding the future assessment of LAS Corporation, you gave it a failing grade as an investment target, but I think that’s not correct. There’s a point you overlooked.” 

Chief Kim Sang-guk’s face was bewildered at my rebuttal. The other executives were the same. 

But since President Son Ilsun was listening attentively with a serious face, Chief Kim Sang-guk quickly erased his expression and listened to me earnestly. 

How much time had passed? 

The debate continued endlessly. Based on the meeting’s content, it was not an exaggeration to call it an intelligentsia’s discussion. 

By now, the other executives in the meeting room couldn’t hide their surprise. 

“President, may I ask one question if it’s not too intrusive?” 

When President Son Ilsun gave a short nod, Chief Kim Sang-guk looked at me. His gaze was oddly reminiscent of Chairman Wang’s. Sharp eyes filled with ambition. 

“Who exactly is this student? Did he study the presentation content beforehand? If he’s this good, I wouldn’t hesitate to suggest bringing him into the strategic planning office.” 

“Chief Kim, didn’t the Chairman personally give you the foreign company investment draft?” 

“Yes, that’s correct.” 

At that moment, President Son Ilsun stared at me. Chief Kim Sang-guk still looked puzzled. 

How could I say it myself? That the one who wrote the foreign company investment draft was none other than me. 

* * * 

“Noona, are you okay?” 

Did something happen while I wasn’t aware? Kim Mihyun’s face looked several years older, perhaps worn out from work. 

The reason was simple. Right before the much-anticipated golden holiday, unexpected guests had arrived. 

“By the way, Hyun, a foreigner came looking for you.” 

“A foreigner?” 

“She was a supermodel-like woman with incredibly long legs. She didn’t leave a business card and just said you’d know if I mentioned a noisy lady going back and forth.” 

A noisy lady? That’s a new one. 

At first, I thought it was Russia’s Anna coming to Korea to find me, but she said she looked like a model. Although Anna had a good figure, she was a bit short to be a model. 

“And there’s another guest who’s been waiting a long time for you. She seemed quite upset.” 

“Another guest?” 

Kim Mihyun nodded with a playful expression. She wouldn’t tell me who it was. But I could roughly guess. 

“Oppa―!” 

Sure enough, as soon as I opened the studio door, a big cat was hugging me tightly. 

Son Yooha looked up at me. Now, I was a bit taller than her. 

Son Yooha made a pouting expression. I knew why the ice queen was acting like this. 

“I’m sorry, Oppa should have met you more often while you were in Korea, but I’ve been a bit busy lately.” 

It would have been nice if I were just busy with preparing for my solo concert. Somehow, the spring break period in Korea and the U.S. was different, so I had to go to school on weekdays. 

“It’s okay if you know.” 

Son Yooha still pouted. I wasn’t good at relationships in my past life either, so I didn’t know how to soothe a girl’s heart. But I couldn’t just leave her alone. Just then, 

Growl. 

Son Yooha’s stomach growled loudly. Her pouting face turned red like a ripe persimmon. 

I smiled and patted her on the head. 

“I’ll make you dinner.” 

“You’ll cook?” 

Yes, I might not look like it, but I have a lot of experience living alone. Moreover, didn’t I travel abroad often in my past life even after marriage? My wife wasn’t one to do housework. 

The gallery’s annex had a place where Director Im Hyera enjoyed her brunch every morning. It was a place where cooking was possible. 

“Tasty, right?” 

“Yup―!” 

I didn’t make anything special. It was just soybean paste stew with chopped green onions and big chunks of tofu, and fried eggs. 

But Son Yooha was eating happily as if she were enjoying a feast. As if she had never pouted. 

I couldn’t help but laugh when she shyly asked for another bowl of rice. 

“Yes, eat a lot so you can grow up quickly.” 

“Don’t worry, I’ll be taller than Oppa soon!” 

Sorry, but this oppa is going to have a growth spurt soon. 

After finishing a delicious dinner, we returned to the studio. 

“Oppa, teach me violin.” 

“What?” 

“I’m playing the violin again. I want to play the piece you played for me.” 

Come to think of it, Son Yooha also learned the violin. 

I handed her a practice violin from the studio. But it was a difficult sheet music for her to play. 

Her fingers were awkward, and her posture was off. Understandable since she hadn’t played the violin for a long time. 

“Oppa, help me.” 

I nodded and was about to correct her posture. 

“No, hold me from behind and play like you’re the one playing. They say you learn faster that way.” 

“What?” 

Son Yooha continued to speak, trying to hide her embarrassment. 

It seemed her goal wasn’t just about playing the violin. Who showed this girl the scene from Ghost? 

But wasn’t her embarrassed look quite cute? I suppressed my laughter and walked behind Son Yooha, aligning our shoulders and arms. 

As if we were playing as one.
