As Lee Hyun-woo, CEO of Jungle, was explaining at length, a brilliant designer named Jordan Live suddenly came to mind.

In his previous life, Jordan Live was the one who exclusively designed the 'Aiphone' and 'Amac' for 【Pineapple】.

The reason Lee Hyun-woo emphasized the need to secure many designers was precisely because of this.

On the other hand, Woo Sang-won was astonished.

He didn't expect Lee Hyun-woo to know so much about Steven Job's past and present in such detail.

‘Well, there's nothing the CEO doesn’t know.’

Even though he was aware, he was still surprised. Working with Lee Hyun-woo felt like being at an amusement park every day.

Now the conclusion reached Woo Sang-won's ears.

“That’s why we need to secure many designers to prepare for the future. In our future, a world driven solely by technology doesn’t exist. We need to add that 'special something' that people like, along with technology.”

“You mean that 'something' is design?”

“Yes, that's right.”

“Understood. Then we’ll hire more in the design department in this recruitment.”

Originally, they were planning to increase it a bit.

Lee Jung-woo had specially requested it for his game development.

But after hearing Lee Hyun-woo's future outlook, he decided to hire even more than he had initially thought.

* * *

Leaving the CEO’s office, Woo Sang-won immediately went to find Lee Jung-woo.

Lee Jung-woo, who hadn’t started working from home yet, welcomed Woo Sang-won in the office.

“Welcome.”

“Oh, are you busy?”

“No, it’s fine. What brings you here?”

“I came to tell you about the conversation with the CEO.”

“You came in person, so it must be good news.”

“Right. We’re going to significantly expand the number of designers in this recruitment.”

“What? Really? Did you mention to the CEO that I requested it?”

“That was part of it, but he already had the idea. He said that computer graphic designers and illustrators must be included in the future of 【Jungle】.”

“Oh, I see.”

Lately, Lee Jung-woo had been so immersed in various tasks that he had forgotten that a day consisted of 24 hours.

As a result, conversations with his brother had dwindled.

Noticing this, Woo Sang-won immediately asked.

“Director Lee, you haven’t been talking much with the CEO lately because you’re busy, right?”

“Yeah, well. Between attending school, coming to work, and recently preparing for working from home.”

“Oh, by the way. How’s the house?”

“I found one. I’m moving this weekend. Director Oh is also in that apartment, and Director Jang will join soon, so I won’t be lonely.”

Woo Sang-won gave a bitter smile.

He could vividly imagine what would happen if the three musketeers gathered.

“There might be drinking parties if you’re not careful.”

“No way.”

The voice at the end was very small.

It meant he couldn’t deny it.

So, he shifted the topic back to his brother.

“By the way, has the CEO mentioned anything about early retirement?”

“He mentioned it occasionally, but not recently. Why?”

“He kept saying that if he left the company, he’d have to nurture a successor, things like that. So I recommended Director Woo.”

Woo Sang-won let out an awkward laugh.

“Haha... Compared to the CEO, I’m too lacking. I don’t have such ambitions. I’m satisfied with assisting the CEO when needed, like now.”

“Yeah, me too. And the others as well. But it seems the CEO doesn’t think that way.”

“No, he’s changed a bit.”

“What? Really?”

“Yes, after meeting Billy Cates, he’s been focusing on work again. And today, when he mentioned Steven Job, his expression completely changed. How should I put it? It was the face of a competitor? So, I asked, and he said it’s going to be fun from now on.”

Suddenly, Lee Jung-woo’s pupils dilated.

Then he said,

“Oh! Something just came to me.”

“Yes, I felt the same today. The CEO has been a bit bored.”

“Yes, Director Kang Dong-ho also mentioned it recently. When he met Billy Cates, the first thing he said was, wasn’t continuous success boring?”

“Right. I heard that too. But as soon as Billy Cates talked about pressuring domestic PC companies to forcibly install ‘Internet Ex Cross,’ the CEO’s eyes completely changed.”

“Really? I just thought of a way to keep the CEO more engaged with the company.”

“Me too. If we find people or create an atmosphere that ignites the CEO’s competitive spirit, like Billy Cates or Steven Job, it might work.”

“Yes, yes, exactly.”

Neither of them wanted Lee Hyun-woo to leave the company early.

In fact, they couldn’t even imagine 【Jungle】 without Lee Hyun-woo.

So any kind of stimulant was welcome.

As long as it raised Lee Hyun-woo’s enthusiasm.

* * *

At that moment, Oh Min-woo was chatting with his American friends for the first time in a while.

- Long time no see, Mikhail.

- Yeah, long time no see.

- Hey, this chatroom sucks. Wanna move to another one?

- Another one? Where?

- I’ll copy and paste the link, so just click it.

The link Oh Min-woo posted directed them to a site called ‘Make Friends.’

It was a chat that required a registration process, but since this was for testing, it wasn’t necessary.

But Mikhail couldn’t help but be curious.

- What’s this?

- Make Friends, it’s going to be serviced in the U.S. soon. I wanted to check if the chat works well and introduce it to you at the same time.

Simultaneously, Oh Min-woo sent a character to the chat window.

Although he didn’t think it was an incredibly great character, it was the first time anyone had sent a character in a chat like this.

Mikhail’s face was clearly surprised.

- Wow, what’s this?

- Oh, this? Our CEO suggested naming it ‘Avatar.’

- Avatar? Wow, really, wow, really.

Even through chat, Mikhail’s surprise was evident, and a smile spread across Oh Min-woo’s face.

He was always a person who lived with excessive confidence.

So, he often boasted in such an exaggerated manner.

This stimulated Mikhail and Ray, leading to the joint search engine research of the three companies following P2P development.

Even now, as Mikhail was stimulated, he couldn’t help but bring up ‘that topic’ in the chat.

- Looks like you’re not working on the search engine anymore?

- Oh, other developers are working on that. I’m going to continue researching the social network side.

- That’s a shame.

- What’s a shame?

- We’re preparing to beat your search engine.

- You’re kidding me.

- Kidding? Your arrogance is deeply ingrained. If you let your guard down like that, you’ll get hurt.

- Please do so. I’m dying of boredom because we’re dominating too much.

- That dominance won’t last long.

- Why are you acting up today?

- Because we’re jointly developing a search engine with 【Macro Soft】 and 【Pineapple】.

Although it was just the first step, Mikhail spoke as if they had been preparing for a long time.

Young people’s competitive spirits were always burning.

In the keyboard battles of a trivial chatroom, they exaggerated and slightly distorted the truth.

Naturally, Oh Min-woo’s eyes shook violently.

- Really?

- Yeah, I wasn’t supposed to tell you, but there will be an article about it next week. 【Pineapple】 wants to raise more funds in the stock market.

As soon as he read Mikhail’s chat, Oh Min-woo pouted and muttered to himself.

“They’re blaming it on others. They’re revealing it to secure more investment themselves.”

Anyway, the alliance of the three companies was no small matter.

However, perhaps like Lee Hyun-woo, Oh Min-woo felt excitement rising at that moment.

‘This is going to be fun.’

* * *

Meanwhile, another big name was calling 【Jungle】’s secretary office.

He was one of the stimulants Woo Sang-won and Lee Jung-woo had hoped for.

“Steven Job is coming to Korea.”

This news was delivered by Han Se-jin.

That day was when Lee Jung-woo was moving houses.

So, at his house were Oh Min-woo, Jang Yoo-cheol, Woo Sang-won, and Han Se-jin.

Originally, Han Se-jin, who insisted that the secretary always be by the CEO’s side regardless of rain or snow, was given strict orders by Lee Hyun-woo to alternate work with Kang Dong-ho on weekends, so she had free time and came here.

“Steven Job?”

“Our CEO’s popularity is through the roof. Everyone wants to see him.”

“But Steven Job is an outdated figure. Maybe that’s why he’s coming to see our rising star, my brother?”

“Jung-woo, your brother’s pride is so high, it’s giving me goosebumps.”

“Seriously. I’m feeling a bit uncomfortable too. Keep it moderate, please. Okay?”

As always, when peers gather, the conversation tends to become trivial.

So, Woo Sang-won was playing the role of keeping things centered.

“Personally, I think it’s a relief. Jamie Yang is visiting next week, and Steven Job is coming at the end of the year to stimulate the CEO, so talk of early retirement or nurturing a successor will be off the table for a while, right?”

“That’s true.”

“It’s fascinating. What’s going on in that brother’s mind? If it were me, I’d grow 【Jungle】 into the second 【Macro Soft】 and dominate the world.”

“Min-woo, that’s because it’s you. My brother is above that. Don’t you see how he tries to apply work-life balance for all employees? You can feel the difference compared to others who grind their souls to grow their companies.”

“There you go again.”

“Oh dear, how long are you two going to bicker? Let’s stop there and discuss how to keep stimulating the CEO.”

“That’s simple. If he talks about a successor, we just refuse. I already told him I’m going to be independent, so I’m out of the successor talk.”

“I also said no.”

“Geez, because of you two, I’m stuck with the heavy burden.”

“Why didn’t you say no too?”

“Exactly, you should have said no like us. If he brings up early retirement again, you’re responsible.”

“There you go fighting again. Stop, and let’s follow Director Woo’s suggestion to keep stimulating the CEO. Or set new goals. Honestly, this time, the war started because Director Woo’s web browser development led to meeting Billy Cates, right?”

“Well, I didn’t develop it all by myself, but it’s true that the CEO is more focused on work due to the war.”

In some ways, it was indeed an absurd situation.

The CEO was someone who pondered how to reduce employees’ workload, while they were thinking about setting higher goals and tasks for the CEO.
