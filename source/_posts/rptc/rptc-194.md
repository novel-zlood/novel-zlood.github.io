Although the economic situation in South Korea has improved more than Lee Hyun-woo expected, this time the editorial was not composed of only positive content.

This is because there were news reports that several places were still on the brink of bankruptcy.

In fact, Lee Hyun-woo predicted that some places would meet a similar end as in his previous life, some would overcome, and entirely new types of companies, like Jungle, would stand out.

After roughly summarizing it like this and sending it to Jang Jae-won, he received immediate email feedback.

- Your predictions these days are amazing. So, from next time, I plan to move the editorials offline. In other words, I intend to release this one online for the last time. What do you think, our Nostradamus?

Lee Hyun-woo, is there any need to refuse?

‘But, will it be okay?’

Would a leading mainstream media like Sejong Daily make such a radical move?

Surely, this was not the world Lee Hyun-woo knew.

It seemed that he had unconsciously clicked in a specific direction since the point of his regression, leading him to this point.

- Of course, it’s good, but as I mentioned before, if I’m busy, I might not be able to post regularly. Please consider that.

As if he was waiting, the reply came immediately.

- Okay, got it.

There were phones and text messages, but it was fascinating to communicate via email like this.

But still, could it compare to the 21st century that Lee Hyun-woo lived in?

‘It will be a long time before messengers like Tok come out, right?’

Honestly, Lee Hyun-woo didn’t even know how to proceed technically.

He was someone who experienced the future, not an engineer.

This part was definitely something Woo Sang-won and others would know better,

‘It seems like it’s not my place to intervene again.’

It reminded him of what Oh Min-woo said before.

He said Lee Hyun-woo was very contradictory.

In reality, emphasizing work-life balance while throwing out various ideas in the middle, how much would he be burdened with work?

As soon as he thought of this, Lee Hyun-woo stood up to look around the work site.

“Are you going somewhere?”

When his secretary Yoo Jin-young asked him, he smiled and replied.

“I’m going to take a look around.”

“Okay, then have a good trip.”

“If I’m late, just go home.”

“Yes, CEO.”

A little later, the first place he arrived at was the online shopping department.

As soon as they saw Lee Hyun-woo, several people stood up and greeted him.

“Oh, CEO?”

“Hello!”

“Good day!”

They were busy greeting him due to the sudden visit, but Lee Hyun-woo told them to continue their work and subtly observed.

Their work was mostly what Lee Hyun-woo was familiar with, and he saw some people having a meeting in the conference room. His eyes widened when he saw the whiteboard.

‘What’s that?’

The title written at the top was <In-house Startup for Online Shopping>.

There were various complex things written down, but the writing was too small, so he moved closer.

Then, the people inside noticed Lee Hyun-woo.

Naturally, they too stopped the meeting and hurried to greet him, but Lee Hyun-woo raised his hand, telling them to continue.

At the same time, he began to check the specific contents written on the board.

‘Wow…’

He couldn’t help but let his mouth drop open.

What he saw on the board was none other than an e-book reader.

Half surprised, half curious, he looked for the person in charge of online shopping.

No, they were already next to him,

“It seems you haven’t received a report from Director Woo yet. Actually, in-house startups are being conducted in each department. Our department is ambitiously preparing an e-book reader.”

The department head, Lee Won-jong, explained in a calm voice.

He used to work at High where Woo Sang-won worked.

Then, after hearing rumors following Woo Sang-won’s move to Jungle, he followed and became the head of the online shopping department.

Originally, Lee Jung-woo was the head of this department, but he got an opportunity when Lee Jung-woo was promoted to CTO.

“Did that idea come from the employees?”

“Yes, it did.”

“Excellent.”

“Do you think it has business potential? It seems a bit early for e-books.”

“There’s nothing early in this world, right? If there’s technology, you make it, and supply creates demand.”

“Ah…”

Lee Won-jong exclaimed at Lee Hyun-woo’s words.

Suddenly, he took out a notebook from his pocket and started writing.

“What are you doing?”

“You always say such precious words. I write down the sayings and use them later.”

“Haha…”

“I actually learned it from Manager Han.”

“Are you talking about Manager Han Se-jin?”

“Yes, I saw that Manager Han’s ideas come from his notes. Watching him always record meticulously, I thought I should do the same. I’ve only recently developed the habit.”

“I see…”

For a moment, he almost mentioned using a device instead of a notebook.

For example, a smartphone, etc.

‘Since we are already developing PDAs, there’s no need to say it and give more work.’

As he had vowed earlier, throwing out new ideas was something to contemplate.

The world changes faster than expected, but it doesn’t move at the expected speed.

Applying this to a company like Jungle gave a clearer conclusion.

CEO Lee Hyun-woo couldn’t contain his surging ideas, saying various things, and he was witnessing the company changing rapidly every time they were implemented.

‘But these people are suffering because of it.’

Work-life balance was just a phrase, and perhaps throwing themselves into in-house startup ideas aside from their jobs wasn’t the same?

Sensing his concern, Lee Won-jong quickly spoke in defense.

“We have removed them from all other tasks. You don’t need to worry.”

“Then aren’t the other employees sharing their work?”

“We are recruiting new employees, but until then, it’s a bit…”

As expected.

Thinking his answer didn’t satisfy Lee Hyun-woo, Lee Won-jong added.

“But don’t worry. We are already screening in the online job market. It seems we just need to conduct interviews and assign them to each team.”

“But their proficiency will be lacking, right?”

“That can’t be helped…”

Seeing Lee Won-jong making excuses repeatedly, Lee Hyun-woo smiled bitterly.

“I keep asking difficult questions.”

“Oh, no.”

“Anyway, it seems like a very good item.”

After saying this, Lee Hyun-woo paused for a moment.

He hesitated to say the next words.

- If it’s the employees’ idea, it might be better to make them independent.

But he couldn’t say it in the end.

Although the purpose of the in-house startup was independence, if they left, inexperienced people would have to fill their places.

Even if there was no immediate impact, investing in and sending them out from the company would affect the remaining employees.

‘No matter how good the treatment at our company is, running a company with one’s own will is vastly different from working while listening to others.’

Reaching this thought, Lee Hyun-woo couldn’t say anything to Lee Won-jong and turned away.

Suddenly, Oh Min-woo’s words about being contradictory kept lingering in his head.

Meeting Kindle Fire Work of Amazonas in his past life was delightful, but if the gaps caused by in-house startups continued, Jungle would have no choice but to release experienced employees and raise newcomers.

‘This is my task.’

Is there a way to solve this?

He needed to think about it from now on.

* * *

As he wandered around the development team inside the company, the entrepreneurial spirit was palpable.

Among them was ‘make friends’, which Lee Hyun-woo had suggested in the past, and several employees were dreaming of startups by trying new things.

Most of them were ingenious, and Lee Hyun-woo, who had experienced the future, could see some items and content that he felt would be somewhat successful.

The gap between reality and ideals made his head complicated.

Just when this wasn’t organized, a call came,

(Let’s meet. I’ll come.)

Kim Tae-hyun’s voice was heard.

And when it was near quitting time, he arrived and immediately asked Lee Hyun-woo.

“Have you seen my siblings yet?”

Knowing why he asked that, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and shook his head.

“No, not yet.”

“Then since you’ve seen me, you’ll get to meet each of the others.”

No matter how much of a chaebol third generation he was, and even if he held a high position, someone in their late twenties or early thirties would inevitably seem immature.

At least in Lee Hyun-woo’s eyes, they appeared so.

In other words, Kim Tae-hyun looked like a younger brother to him.

‘I thought it was funny when I first heard it, but the fair competition among these three siblings is really a joke.’

Maybe they didn’t realize it themselves, but being born with a silver spoon, it could hardly be called fair competition.

However, without expressing this out loud, Lee Hyun-woo asked.

“Hyung, how does Guseong manage its talents?”

“How do we manage talents? You mean how we retain them when other companies scout them?”

“It’s similar, but a bit different. Recently, our company’s treatment has improved as much as yours, right?”

“Oh?”

“Isn’t it?”

“Well, I can’t deny it. I know the salaries are similar.”

The salary they used to give to university students hired as half part-timers was worlds apart.

Now, Jungles’ new employees are earning over 20 million won annually.

With guaranteed commuting, welfare, and treatment that rival major corporations.

“Anyway, whether they go to another company or start their own business, is there any know-how to prevent the outflow of employees?”

“Why ask such a difficult question? The answer is simple.”

“Simple?”

“Of course it’s simple. People always calculate in their heads, right? In other words, they compare the conditions and surrounding environments when they stay versus when they leave. Isn’t the answer obvious? If overwhelmingly better conditions are guaranteed when they stay, they won’t leave.”

“That… That’s right…”

Lee Hyun-woo was at a loss for words due to the overly simple answer.

But what Kim Tae-hyun said was undeniably true.

It made his previous concerns seem laughable.

“I really am an idiot.”

“What’s wrong with you today?”

Lee Hyun-woo silently smiled.

‘Make them realize that staying is overwhelmingly better?’

With that answer in mind, there were countless things he could do.

First, he intended to give in-house entrepreneurs a choice.

In other words, they could remain as a small subsidiary of Jungle or become independent.

At the same time, if the benefits for those who stay were strengthened, they would at least consider it.

There were many benefits to offer.

Simply by offering stock options, they would drool.

If Jungle went public, they could become multimillionaires in an instant.

“Hyun-woo, now it’s my turn. You know what I’m going to ask, right?”

Lee Hyun-woo nodded with a smile.

“I know the question and the answer is simple.”

“Really? You also have a simple answer?”

“Of course. Right now, the chairman is testing the three of you, right? Keeping you on your toes and encouraging the others not to give up the challenge.”

Although he omitted sensitive key terms, Kim Tae-hyun knew what Lee Hyun-woo was talking about and nodded.

“Yes. Because of that, the atmosphere at the breakfast table has become weird, leading to childish competition.”

“Yes, but if the place you invested in with my advice succeeds? Will that really be recognized by the chairman?”

“……”

“I don’t think so. So why not tell the chairman today? That you’ll do it on your own without any help! Just that alone will earn you recognition from the chairman, won’t it?”

“……!”
