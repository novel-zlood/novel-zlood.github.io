Even in the distant United States, people were paying close attention to Lee Hyun-woo's visit to Taiwan.

In particular, Jamie Wang kept asking his secretary, Steve Wong, before boarding the plane to Taiwan.

"Has he arrived?"

"Yes, he has."

"How did it go?"

"It seems the media attention was relatively less because he came with Korean celebrities."

"Hmm..."

Jamie Wang's trip to Taiwan was not originally planned.

However, as the schedule for 【Yaho Taiwan】 was moved forward, he also decided to hastily go to Taiwan.

Coincidentally, this timing overlapped perfectly with Lee Hyun-woo's schedule.

'Does he know I'm going?'

For some reason, Jamie Wang had a feeling they might meet in Taiwan.

Is Jamie Wang hoping for that?

Yes.

He wanted to meet Lee Hyun-woo at least once.

It felt like it would be stimulating for some reason.

So, even on the plane, he kept asking Steve questions.

"How old did you say he was?"

"He's twenty-seven."

At twenty-seven, Lee Hyun-woo was two years younger than Jamie Wang.

Therefore, the two were often compared in the information and communication industry.

Whether Lee Hyun-woo was conscious of this or not, Jamie Wang couldn't help but be aware of it.

Currently, it's Taiwan and Hong Kong, but who knows where the portal site wars will take place in the future.

However, it seemed like he shouldn't think of Lee Hyun-woo as just an enemy.

"I heard he's trying to improve internet speeds worldwide for the commercialization of MP3 files."

"Yes, that's correct."

"Then we need to work together on that."

"Yes, I think so too."

Now, Jamie had to acknowledge Lee Hyun-woo and 【Jungle】 within the larger framework of cooperation and competition.

"When I get to Taiwan, I should mention speed a lot during interviews. I need to gather some of the interviews 'Lee' has done."

Lee Hyun-woo's efforts to improve internet speeds were evident in his words and actions.

So, as soon as he arrived in Taiwan, it was like asking to prepare materials.

"There's one thing to consider. If internet speeds improve, it could be more advantageous for 【Jungle】. They have much more content than we do."

Steve was diligently fulfilling his role.

It was correct to go together, but that should be after they had their own weapons.

Jamie nodded in agreement, as Steve's point wasn't wrong.

Seeing this, Steve offered one more piece of advice.

"I know you don't like hearing this, but shouldn't we also quickly catch up with the successful content of 【Jungle】? 【Jungle USA】 is already preparing for music services and shopping."

"That's right."

【Yaho】 also had shopping.

They were competing with 【Amazones】 and 【E Base】 in their own way.

However, if 【Jungle USA】 entered the market, wouldn't it become a three-way battle turning into a chaotic competition?

"Since many companies will likely challenge shopping in the future, we should start with MP3 music, which we don't currently service..."

"Yes, let's go. And let's also benchmark the community, blog, and other things that 【Jungle】 does."

"……."

Steve's eyes widened slightly.

Originally, Jamie Wang was too proud to want to be seen as following others.

This was common among young blood.

They showed the spirit of being the best, with a strong desire to win and confidence to overpower their opponents.

'He's definitely realized that 【Jungle】 is no easy opponent.'

The quick second-place strategy to dominate new markets, the fast follower.

【Yaho】 could do it too.

'This might be a turning point in our business strategy.'

Steve had been supporting Jamie since the founding of 【Yaho】, who was younger than him.

Of course, he knew well that Jamie had a warm heart and could empathize.

But management couldn't be done with just a warm heart.

Sometimes, one needed to be able to take criticism and coldness was required more than warmth.

As he consistently emphasized coldness over a long time, it seemed to have put a social mask on Jamie's face.

Even now, it was the same.

'Cooperation is good, but in this field, there are times when you shouldn't yield during competition. And at those times, feelings are bound to get hurt.'

In this competitive field, the one who couldn't be more cold-hearted or who had a warm heart would take a bigger hit.

As he had somehow put a social mask on Jamie's face, his boss might now be able to keep 【Yaho】 at the top.

* * *

At that time.

"Oh, right. Jamie Wang is coming to Taiwan."

At the last moment of the strategy meeting that started after their arrival, Han Se-jin spoke as if something had just occurred to him.

Even Kang Dong-ho, who didn't know this, opened his eyes wide.

"Jamie Wang?"

"Yes, it must have been a sudden decision."

"Ah... Now that you mention it, because the schedule for 【Yaho Taiwan】 was moved up, his schedule in Taiwan must have also been moved up."

At that moment, Lee Hyun-woo's eyes sparkled as he spoke to the two.

"Shall we try to meet?"

"Sorry?"

"……?"

The two looked at Lee Hyun-woo in surprise.

In Korea, it wasn't emphasized as much, but in the United States, there were many articles portraying Lee Hyun-woo and Jamie Wang as industry rivals.

In a way, it was natural.

Being of Asian descent, around the same age, and having the common denominator of portal sites, comparisons were inevitable.

So, when Joe Murphy often talked about it last time, the two thought Lee Hyun-woo would be quite conscious of Jamie Wang.

"I don't think it's a bad idea. If the two of us speak out together about the need to expedite the IT infrastructure in Taiwan or Hong Kong, it could be beneficial."

"Ah, but CEO, do you think they would want that from their side?"

"Yes, I think the same as Section Chief Han. 【Yaho】 has different content from us. While they might enter later on, they might be satisfied with the current internet speed level for now."

Their opinions were valid.

However, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and gently insisted on his point.

"You're right, but that's why we should meet. Because our meeting itself could become a big topic in Taiwan or Hong Kong. Then, when I speak in interviews, Jamie Wang's name will always follow."

Articles have patterns.

Especially when highlighting rival relationships, when A's name is mentioned, B's name follows.

Thus, when A says something, it gets reported as if B agrees or disagrees, subtly manipulating public perception.

This psychological technique would be emphasized more in the future, just as 【Guseong Electronics】 reaped significant benefits when compared with 【Pineapple】 smartphones.

When A's product was released, B's product was always mentioned.

"Moreover, if 【Yaho Taiwan】 and 【Jungle Taiwan】 keep getting mentioned, won't there be more news and articles? So, please arrange a meeting with Jamie Wang as soon as he arrives in Taiwan."

"Do you think Jamie Wang will accept our request?"

"From what I know of his nature, I'm sure he will."

"Ah, yes. Then I'll contact him once he arrives in Taiwan."

Kang Dong-ho responded more actively.

And indeed, after leaving Lee Hyun-woo's accommodation, he made several calls.

In fact, for 【Yaho Taiwan】 to start, they needed to establish a branch in Taiwan, and there was no way Jamie Wang wouldn't visit.

So, after contacting the relevant people and conveying Lee Hyun-woo's desire to meet,

(Ah, yes, we'll inform you right away after he returns.)

Even in Taiwan, people were starting to compare Lee Hyun-woo's 【Jungle】 with Jamie Wang's 【Yaho】.

Thus, the staff at 【Yaho Taiwan】 couldn't help but relay this news.

The response came the next day after Lee Hyun-woo had finished a few interviews with Taiwanese media.

"CEO, Jamie has responded. He said he has time tomorrow morning."

"Ah, then please tell him I'll visit his hotel in the morning."

"Yes, understood."

If he only did what was instructed, he wouldn't be the talented Kang Dong-ho nurtured by Lee Hyun-woo.

He subtly leaked the news of their meeting to reporters, and the next morning, quite a few reporters were gathered in front of the hotel where Jamie Wang was staying.

Seeing this, Lee Hyun-woo thought.

'It's about time to move these two to my secretariat.'

As the group grew, there were many things Lee Hyun-woo couldn't handle personally.

So, he urgently needed a secretariat that could convey the group's situation and prepare what he needed to do.

Although Yoo Jin-young was there, she was mainly limited to receiving guests and forwarding calls internally.

Moreover, the secretariat was typically comprised of the most capable people in the company who would assist for several years.

'Please work by my side for just a few years.'

Here, a few years meant until Lee Hyun-woo retired.

* * *

When Lee Hyun-woo met Jamie Wang in the office provided by the hotel, Jamie Wang greeted him with a bright smile and extended his hand first.

"Nice to meet you."

"Why does it feel like we've met before? Hahaha."

"Actually, I feel the same way. You're so famous. Hahaha."

Jamie Wang responded to Lee Hyun-woo's witty remark.

The initial atmosphere became very light.

'He's different from other Asian businesspeople I've met.'

Although Jamie Wang was also of Asian descent, he grew up in the U.S., so he was from a completely different culture.

However, being from a Taiwanese family, he had plenty of opportunities to meet Asians.

There were many.

But most Asians would start with formalities and not throw light jokes like this.

Moreover, Lee Hyun-woo was leading the situation without hesitation.

"Shall we sit? Ah, and I love coffee."

It felt like the roles were reversed, but it didn't come off as rude.

And then.

"I've always wanted to meet you."

Such proactive expressions naturally increased his likability.

Jamie Wang asked,

"Me?"

"Yes, after all, 【Yaho】 was the first in the portal site business. Since we're the latecomers, I wanted to pay my respects and talk about various things."

"Ah, hahaha."

A genuine, pleasant laugh came out.

However, Jamie Wang was a businessman.

Initially, he was full of pure intentions, but over time, he had to hold onto things he couldn't let go of or had to seize things he couldn't miss, leading him to include what he wanted in his words while laughing.

"In another sense, we will also challenge 【Jungle】 as latecomers."

In other words, they intended to offer community, blogs, and music services as well.

This was implicitly included in the words he delivered to Lee Hyun-woo.

Then Lee Hyun-woo nodded with a smile and threw a straightforward remark.

"Yes, if it's a cooperative competitive relationship, it's always welcome. Ah, if you need it, 【Jungle】's search engine is also available."

In short, he was suggesting that 【Yaho】 adopt 【Jungle】's search engine.

This was a way of expressing technological superiority.
