A little while later, as the new year of 2003 began, Seorabeol Hotel became Seorabeol Group and set up various goals in earnest.

After all, the core was tourism and travel.

Hence, Kim Ah-young announced a grand project, spreading a press release that the group, centered around hotels and duty-free shops, would pursue travel agencies and airlines.

The management also brought in capable people from related industries, each adding a remark.

“Our group's hope lies with those who can read the future.”

It was a request to manage with a long-term perspective, not short-sighted management.

Easier said than done, how could anyone predict the future unless they were Nostradamus?

Kim Ah-young knew this, and she kept reminding herself that it would take considerable effort to lower the expectations set for Lee Hyun-woo, the blogger Nostradamus.

“The CEOs we brought in are not Lee Hyun-woo. The CEOs we brought in are not Nostradamus.”

High expectations often lead to great disappointment. She steadied herself to avoid demanding more than they were capable of, which could lead to severe setbacks later.

Fortunately, in response to Kim Ah-young's request, the CEOs of each affiliate set long-term plans first and then subdivided them into yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, and monthly goals.

Particularly, the internally promoted CEO of Seorabeol Hotel suggested expanding package deals that included both flights and accommodations.

Since Seorabeol Airlines had not yet received government approval, it was an idea that came up.

Meanwhile, they emphasized that if they partnered with other airlines, it would be quite feasible, and Kim Ah-young accepted it, so the project proceeded immediately.

Originally, the major airlines in the country were wary of Seorabeol Group's entry into the low-cost airline market, but they willingly joined hands when a partnership was proposed.

As a result, the number of flights between the mainland and Jeju Island increased rapidly, and tourists started overflowing on the island daily.

However, they say the one who does the work is the bear, and the one who takes the money is the king.

Later, Kim Ah-young randomly discovered a title when she entered Jungle Shopping.

- Do you still carry a mountain of luggage when you travel to Jeju Island?

Clicking on the curiosity-inducing event notification, she encountered an ingenious content.

A simple way to visit Jeju Island

First, access Jungle Shopping and book a discounted package for flights and accommodation.

Second, access Jungle Shopping again and order the necessities for Jeju Island.

Third, receive the ordered items at the accommodation booked in the package.

It was a brilliant business tactic.

Of course, many people might not do this to save more money, but even if a few did, there would be no loss.

‘Indeed, my husband is amazing.’

She didn't know if Lee Hyun-woo had devised this, but whoever came up with the idea, it could be said that Lee Hyun-woo was the one who boldly pushed the corporate culture to make it happen.

‘I still have a long way to go. I have a lot to learn.’

* * *

At that moment, Lee Hyun-woo was receiving a report from Woo Sang-won about the related content.

“It seems the chairman’s idea is working quite well.”

“That's a relief.”

Lee Hyun-woo nodded with a smile.

Originally, this event was based on big data and was an idea proposed by Lee Hyun-woo.

He first looked into the habits of people visiting Jeju Island.

Before traveling, they invariably stopped by a mart, set foot on Jeju Island with heavy luggage, rented a car, unpacked at their accommodation, and realized they had forgotten something.

Thus, this event could solve many issues with one blow.

Without needing to stop by a mart, they could click once at home and receive the items at their accommodation upon arrival in Jeju Island.

Even if they realized they had forgotten something, they could order it on the day they arrived in Jeju Island and receive it the next morning, making it very convenient.

“How did the car rental companies respond?”

“We are currently coordinating the details. We should be able to implement a package event that includes car rentals soon.”

When one holds big data that governs people’s daily lives, new revenue models like this can be created.

Moreover, having experienced the future, Lee Hyun-woo could filter out successes and failures with his ‘big data in my head,’ making Jungle the king that controls the performing bear.

However, growth always comes with side effects.

“Chairman, I have something to discuss with you.”

“Yes, go ahead.”

“Currently, Jungle Communication has become too bloated.”

“Oh…”

That was precisely the issue of excessive workload due to rapid growth.

If it were any other company, they would gradually expand departments and hire more staff while waiting for the success of specific businesses, but that didn’t work well at Jungle.

Everything took the shortcut, even unintentionally.

Therefore, Jungle Communication had finally started experiencing overload.

“I think it’s time to divide the company into three sections: portal, shopping, and new product planning and development.”

“I’ve been neglectful. It must have been hard for you.”

“No, it’s still manageable. I’m mentioning it now because, based on past experiences, it might become difficult soon.”

In fact, Woo Sang-won was suggesting this based on several trial and error experiences.

If things continued as they were, there would definitely be bottlenecks due to work traffic.

“Yes, then let’s separate the affiliates into three sections for more efficient operation.”

“Thank you for considering my opinion.”

“I should be the one thanking you. You provided a good suggestion.”

As Jungle grew in size, it became difficult for Lee Hyun-woo to closely monitor the entire group.

At times like this, it was indeed necessary for the CEOs of each affiliate to take initiative, and he was grateful that Woo Sang-won had preemptively diagnosed the problem.

* * *

A little while later, after the announcement of the physical separation, Jungle's stock price began to soar again.

It was similar to a few years ago.

No, it was more explosive this time.

Back then, when Jungle separated into a holding company and affiliates, there was a mix of expectations and concerns, but over time, expectations were met and concerns were eliminated, so the market trusted this physical separation.

Kim Tae-hyun, who had returned to Jeju Island, admired Lee Hyun-woo.

“Usually, physical separation involves significant risks, so the stock price doesn’t usually rise like this… My brother-in-law is truly remarkable.”

“You flatter me.”

“I’m serious.”

Listening to the conversation between the brother-in-law and the brother-in-law at the dinner table, their wives started to intervene.

“Do you have to talk about such stiff topics here?”

“Indeed, unnie. Oppa, we agreed not to talk about work at home…”

“I know, I know. But I’m so envious that I can’t help but bring it up.”

“Why would you be envious of anyone else? Guseong Electronics is doing incredibly well too, isn’t it?”

Kim Ah-young’s words were true.

Guseong Electronics was also gradually getting on track with all the projects it had ventured into.

However, the market’s evaluation was harsh, so the stock price was not rising but rather declining.

Moreover,

“Recently, the chicken game has made things quite tough.”

The chicken game sweeping through the semiconductor industry had significantly reduced net profits.

“So? Surely you’re not planning to seek advice from my husband again, are you?”

“Why not? It’s great when brothers-in-law help each other out.”

“Fine, then you two go ahead and talk business all you want. Unnie and I will go play with the kids.”

“Oh? Th… there’s no need to go that far…”

Kim Tae-hyun’s words and expressions felt contradictory.

It was as if he appreciated them stepping out.

Seeing this, Lee Hyun-woo smiled wryly but decided to give Kim Tae-hyun assurance, knowing that he was troubled by the current chicken game, which he was not unrelated to.

‘I once advised my father-in-law to push through the chicken game.’

Given the current situation and the recent repeated events from his past life, he couldn’t help but step in as Kim Tae-hyun was deeply anxious.

This was due to the mention of reverse DRAM by Inter recently.

After the wives took the children out, Kim Tae-hyun subtly brought up the topic as the house quieted down.

“Did you read the article too? Inter predicted a generational shift in DRAM.”

“Yes, they said the era led by DDR DRAM would soon change to reverse DRAM.”

“I don’t agree with that idea, but since Inter, which has absolute dominance in the CPU market, said it, it’s causing a huge commotion. Semiconductor companies in the US and Germany, as well as Japanese ones, have been investing in reverse DRAM for the past 2-3 years.”

“You’re right, hyung. No matter how influential Inter is, it can't easily switch to CPUs that support reverse DRAM against the current standards.”

Switching would only bring more problems.

It would be like selling a well-performing business to venture into a new field, essentially handing over the market to competitors like ADM or Guseong Electronics, who are eagerly eyeing Inter’s position.

Despite knowing this, semiconductor companies unable to foresee the future have been over-investing in the past two years.

The market is the same, predicting that reverse DRAM will surpass DDR DRAM in a few years, buying stocks of companies transitioning to reverse DRAM, and ignoring companies like Guseong Electronics or GB Electronics focused on DDR DRAM.

Perhaps because of this, DDR DRAM prices were at rock bottom.

There was still demand, but the bleak future outlook prevented its fair value from being reflected in the semiconductor trading market.

“Your words are reassuring, but we are currently selling DDR DRAM at a loss. I’m trying to console myself that there will be better days, but the Japanese companies are quite confident. They seem to imply that their era is coming.”

“Who? Japanese companies?”

“Yes, and the many people who invested in them.”

“Then, congratulations in advance.”

“Congratulations?”

“Yes, it seems like the DDR DRAM super cycle will arrive as early as the end of this year or by next year.”

Lee Hyun-woo was certain.

Since it was a replica event from his past life, similar developments would follow this time as well.

“Really? Then should we continue as we are?”

“Actually, it might be good to expand the lines further.”

“Re… really?”

“Yes, trust me. I assure you, your decision will be praised as a masterstroke.”

Now, Kim Tae-hyun, who trusted Lee Hyun-woo even if he said he made meju with red beans, nodded with a clearly relieved expression.

“Alright, I’ll push forward with your trust.”

A little while later, Guseong Electronics announced the expansion of its DDR DRAM lines, ignoring the generational shift theory of DRAM.

The market thought it was crazy, and competitors were delighted.

They believed that the dominant Guseong Electronics had made a momentary misjudgment.

Naturally, the stock price plummeted.

There were even consecutive lower limits.

A little while later, when it seemed to have hit rock bottom, Lee Hyun-woo bought up Guseong Electronics’ stock to encourage them.

Soon, a reversal news broke.

‘Inter, critical defect found in reverse DRAM!’

‘What will the Japanese semiconductor companies do? Inter officially abandons support for reverse DRAM!’

Here’s an interesting phenomenon.

The winner was Guseong Electronics, but somehow, as if by coincidence, Jungle and Lee Hyun-woo, who had bought up the company’s stock at a low price, became the king again.
