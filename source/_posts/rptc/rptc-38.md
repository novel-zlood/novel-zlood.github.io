Since his expression and tone were relaxed, I thought he would at least spare some time for a meal together.

But is he so busy that he can't even confirm one appointment?

'Or are there too many clients at the level of a department head from Aejeong Group?'

A clear emotion was evident in Choi Sun-hwa's pupils.

It was obviously not a good feeling.

That look seemed similar to what Kim Ah-young had earlier.

'This slightly hurts my pride.'

In fact, before meeting Lee Hyun-woo, she thoroughly investigated Jungle Soft.

In just a little over half a year, it had achieved tremendous growth.

How incredible was it? It was almost like magic.

I don't know if it's just a coincidence or the ability of this person.

'One thing for sure is that he stands tall with a smile.'

Choi Sun-hwa judged that even when treating customers, there might be different levels of importance.

She stood up from her seat and made a resolution inwardly.

She would become a major advertiser for Jungle Soft.

'Well, they did say that the number of users logging into Jungle is comparable to one of the top four PC communications services these days.'

At this rate, surpassing the number of PC communication users is just a matter of time.

If so, wouldn't it be possible to advertise Aejeong Cosmetics to numerous users and expect unexpected gains?

By the time she had drawn this picture in her mind, she realized that the elevator had already reached the lobby floor.

When the door opened, she saw the daughter of the owner of this place, whom she had encountered at the entrance earlier.

'Kim Ah-young.'

What brings her to the lobby today?

Not knowing the reason, she approached and asked in a familiar tone.

"Are you done with your work?"

"Yeah, just finished."

"Did it go well?"

"Yeah, it went very well."

"How about we grab a coffee since it's been a while?"

"Shall we?"

She had already passed by Kim Ah-young earlier with the excuse of being busy, so she couldn't do it again now.

So, the two sat face to face, sipping coffee a little later.

"Should I congratulate you first? I heard you took on Aejeong Cosmetics?"

"I'm still in the learning phase. I should be the one congratulating you. You're taking charge of this hotel, aren’t you?"

"Then let's congratulate each other."

At Kim Ah-young's last words, Choi Sun-hwa paused to think.

In fact, it's hard to compare Guseong Group and Aejeong Group, which are at the top in our country.

No matter how much of a chaebol daughter she is, from Choi Sun-hwa's perspective, Kim Ah-young is at the pinnacle.

Usually, she wouldn't even bother with her, so why is she showing interest today?

Perhaps a little conversation would reveal her intention.

Soon, Kim Ah-young's voice was heard again.

"By the way, it's like we're both taking the first step into society, right?"

"Pretty much."

"I want us to support and help each other."

"If that's the case, I'd love it."

Choi Sun-hwa was delighted.

There are countless benefits to being close to the eldest daughter of Guseong Group.

So, she answered Kim Ah-young's continued questions honestly.

"By the way, was your business partner today Jungle Soft?"

"Huh? How did you know?"

"It's our hotel. Jungle Soft was the only company that booked the business room at that time."

"I see."

"Are you planning to promote your cosmetics business through Jungle?"

"Yes, and we're also planning to advertise through Jungle Soft."

"Advertising? What kind?"

"Well, where should I start explaining this?"

"You can just tell me."

Kim Ah-young's eyes were saying it.

No matter how complicated, she would understand it all.

Still, not knowing, she said it like this.

"Do you think employees from American companies like E-base, Amazones, and Yahoo don't do business with our group? I've experienced it and studied it separately."

"It looks like Jungle is planning to launch an advertisement exposure business on web pages. They proposed it to me."

"Oh... I get it now."

"With the increasing number of people using Jungle these days, I think it's an effective advertisement."

"Yeah. That sounds good."

At Kim Ah-young's last words, Choi Sun-hwa felt like a cold bucket of water was poured on her head.

'I think I told her too much.'

Someone's 'first' can leave a strong impression.

That's why Choi Sun-hwa wanted Aejeong Cosmetics to be the first in Jungle Soft’s banner advertisement.

'No way Guseong is also doing this advertisement, right?'

Choi Sun-hwa is not good at hiding things.

Even now, she was about to ask Kim Ah-young, but the other party spoke first.

"Should we give it a try too?"

"What?"

"Internet advertisement. I'm interested too."

"Aren't you talking about Seorabeol Hotel? Is it necessary?"

"As soon as I became a registered director, I felt we needed some change."

No matter how much she thought about it, Choi Sun-hwa judged that there was nothing to gain by advertising Seorabeol Hotel on the internet.

However, she knew Kim Ah-young’s personality too well.

Elegant looks, but once she sets her mind on something, she sees it through to the end.

'I need to hurry with the advertisement.'

Choi Sun-hwa thought she should go back to the company right away today and discuss it with the management.

The same determination was in Kim Ah-young.

Shortly after they parted, she gave instructions to her secretary, Park Min-sook, with a firm tone.

"Jungle is preparing for internet advertising."

"Really?"

"Considering the recent pace, I think the internet might have a greater impact than TV media in the future. So we should start advertising early."

"......"

The secretary couldn't refute her decisiveness.

This tone represented Kim Ah-young's personality.

In fact, the person who moved the decisions of these two women was Lee Hyun-woo.

Or perhaps it should be called indifference?

Women who always attracted the interest of men around them due to their looks, intelligence, and powerful background were slightly provoked by Lee Hyun-woo's indifference.

Because of this, the advertising decisions of the two women might contribute to the dramatic growth of Jungle Soft.

* * *

The first inquiry came from Aejeong Group, and the content reached Lee Hyun-woo's ears after the weekend, on Monday when he went to work.

"Since you mentioned the advertisement last time, they actively asked when we would start."

"The date hasn't been set yet. It depends on the development team."

"Banners can be made quickly."

Han Se-jin's question, Lee Hyun-woo’s toss, and finally Jang Yoo-chul’s answer hinted that creating advertisement banners would be easy.

But Lee Hyun-woo wanted to take his time.

More precisely, the website needed to be organized.

"Mr. Jang Yoo-chul."

"Yes, CEO."

"Don't you think we need to overhaul the auction, online shopping, blog, and advertising we discussed at the last workshop?"

He now casually mentioned the term "blog."

It was agreed to use that term at Jungle.

More precisely, they had concluded to call it a portal site.

"That's right. It does feel a bit cluttered."

"Then let's split it into two."

"Split into two?"

"One for online shopping and auction, the other for the portal site. But make sure to pay attention to the connection between the two."

"We can connect them with hyperlinks here and there."

"You can prepare for that, right?"

"Yes, I'll get started."

In a meeting revolving mainly around the three, someone who had been quietly listening suddenly spoke up.

"Excuse me, CEO, I have something to say."

He was Woo Sang-won, who came from PC communication company "Hi."

As soon as Woo Sang-won joined Jungle, he was assigned a team leader position.

Lee Hyun-woo valued his experience and capability highly.

Even now, he perked up his ears to not miss any of Woo Sang-won’s opinions.

"Go ahead."

"I think we'll need a few more developers if we're going to split the website into two."

"Of course. That's why we're continuously hiring developers."

"Yes, I've noticed you conducting interviews here."

The interviews were great.

The issue was whether the developers were qualitatively excellent.

To be precise, it was regretful that there weren’t many experienced candidates in this field where experience is precious.

Therefore, Woo Sang-won cautiously pointed out this part.

"But shouldn't the portal site be composed of more specialized personnel?"

"I want that too. But as we are still a small company, such people do not knock on our door."

The portal site marketability was already demonstrated by Yahoo in the U.S. last April.

They recorded the highest IPO price ever in the U.S. stock market immediately after going public.

It was assumed that PC communication companies were also preparing for it.

"How about my old colleagues? I can vouch for their skills as we worked together on the search engine. Hi was also considering a portal site."

They must not have been idle either.

As Woo Sang-won talked about his friends, a brief silence followed.

Many hesitated slightly.

Unless it's voluntary, poaching people from another company is always a burden.

Did Woo Sang-won notice this atmosphere?

He quickly clarified.

"For reference, my colleagues have already submitted their resignation and are looking for other jobs."

"In that case, it's a definite 'okay.' Contact them right away."

"Yes, understood."

The decision was quick.

After starting with online auctions and moving on to online shopping, Lee Hyun-woo was now fully setting the stage for a portal site.

'Once the floodgates are opened, won’t a lot of good developers come pouring in?'

* * *

After the meeting, Woo Sang-won stepped outside for a smoke.

He pulled out a mobile phone from his pocket.

This symbolized something.

Jungle's employee benefits were the best.

Even though the 100,000 won fee was excluded and paid by the individual, there weren't many companies that provided mobile phones immediately upon joining.

No, except for a few large corporations like Guseong, the provision of mobile phones was almost non-existent.

And even if they did, it would be at a discounted price, not provided directly.

He wanted to tell the team members he used to get along with about this heavenly workplace.

When he mentioned it, they all said they carried resignation letters in their pockets.

Now, Woo Sang-won called one of them.

(Hello?)

"It's me, Woo Sang-won."

(Oh, team leader.)

The person on the other end was one of those who had called in sick to Hi today.

So, the story he told Lee Hyun-woo earlier, about submitting resignation letters, included some lies.

"I've informed the CEO. Prepare for the interview."

(Really? Can we really do it?)

"Of course. When I mentioned it, our CEO was delighted."

(I'll submit my resignation right away then.)

"Huh? Isn't that risky? There's no guarantee you'll pass the interview."

(I know, but I can't work here anymore. Manager Song is making us work our souls out lately.)

Hi was still the same.

Realizing this, Woo Sang-won reaffirmed his goal.

'I will bring down Hi with Jungle.'

For that, Jungle must become the best in the industry.

Woo Sang-won's firm voice penetrated the phone receiver again.

"Alright, submit your resignation. It's not a place to stay."
