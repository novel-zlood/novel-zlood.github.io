Kim Tae-hyun believed that he could certainly uncover Nostradamus' true identity with the bait of advertising, so he gave the order and waited quietly.

In the afternoon, his secretary reported to him.

"You can meet anytime except weekends, between 7:45 AM and 11:45 AM, and between 12:45 PM and 4:45 PM."

"Why those times?"

"It's their working hours. They don't meet anyone outside of working hours due to business relations..."

"......"

Kim Tae-hyun's expression hardened slightly.

‘What a strange guy.’

The CEO of 【Jungle】 is a person who has set peculiar rules.

But since he needed something urgently, what else could he do?

"Alright, then let's schedule it for tomorrow. Call them here."

"Yes, understood."

By "here," he meant 【Guseong Systems】.

While Kim Ah-young was intermittently receiving shares of 【Seorabeol】, Kim Tae-hyun was increasing his shares in 【Guseong Systems】.

Both he and his father had decided on this, believing it would be a key subsidiary in the future information society.

Since there were no results yet, he couldn’t raise his voice in front of his father.

So he thought of figuring out Nostradamus' identity and informing his uncle to get some support from him.

It might seem trivial, but today’s blog post mentioned the power struggle between 【Daehan Communications】 and 【Daehan Electric】, and Nostradamus was the one who wrote about it.

Upon investigation, it turned out to be true.

This was something a mere employee could not have known.

Therefore, he felt it was even more necessary to find out who this high-ranking person was.

‘I will make them talk tomorrow. Absolutely.’

* * *

The next morning, Lee Hyun-woo set out for 【Guseong Systems】.

He had already guessed much of what was going on.

‘It's obvious even without looking.’

Last time, Kim Ah-young stepped in, but since that didn’t work, now the heir of 【Guseong】 was calling directly?

Maybe they were deducing that Nostradamus might be a high-ranking executive within the group.

【Guseong】 is very sensitive about exposing its talents.

Especially for those in high positions; if they leave and pass on technology elsewhere, it would be a disaster.

‘Then today, I should dodge skillfully.’

Thinking this, Lee Hyun-woo met Kim Tae-hyun shortly afterward, greeted him first, took a seat, and asked leisurely.

"I heard you're interested in banner ads."

"Yes, that's right. We want to place our company's ads in the most visible spots."

"Can I ask what products they are?"

"That will be decided after today's talk. At least one, but potentially almost all subsidiaries will advertise in 【Jungle】."

Lee Hyun-woo's eyebrows raised.

Currently ranked third in the group, 【Guseong】 is projected to become the top in the future.

It has numerous subsidiaries.

‘I hit the jackpot.’

Already smelling money, he smiled and spoke again.

"I'm very interested in what we'll be discussing."

"Right. What will we be talking about?"

"Perhaps the identity of Nostradamus?"

"......"

"I guessed it. Judging by your expression, that's what you wanted to ask."

"I can't deny it. Can you tell me?"

"Due to personal information, that would be difficult..."

"I’ll offer home appliances first. As you know, we have countless products like TVs and computers."

"I understand, but I have an obligation to protect personal information."

"Hmm...."

"The only thing I can tell you is that you don’t need to worry."

"I don't need to worry?"

"Yes, that's correct. Actually, I can guess why you're so interested. You’re worried they might be a high-ranking executive within the group, right? Am I wrong?"

His silence was as good as a confirmation.

Normally, Kim Tae-hyun is not someone whose moves are so easily read.

He is not extremely capable, but he is not naive enough to convey information through his expressions.

In his previous life, he acted naive during hearings to drag out time or avoid difficult questions.

‘Right now, he’s naive.’

Not in personality, but in the sense that he was being read thoroughly by the experienced Lee Hyun-woo.

Having lived one more life, there was naturally a gap between them.

Even now, he was leisurely controlling the situation.

"They have no relation to 【Guseong】."

"Really?"

"Yes, I can guarantee that."

"Hmm...."

"Additionally, this is all the information I can provide. I’m giving you information I haven't shared with anyone else, so please be reassured."

"You haven't told anyone?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Hearing this, Kim Tae-hyun's expression became peculiar.

It was because the previous day, Kim Ah-young acted as if she knew everything.

‘She did it again.’

Kim Ah-young, who had created similar situations several times due to her pride.

It turned out she was just pretending to know without actually having any information.

Thinking up to this point, he heard Lee Hyun-woo's voice again.

"You don't have to advertise in 【Jungle】 just for that information."

"No, a promise is a promise. Although I didn’t find out their exact identity, you said they have no relation to our group, and I believe you. Therefore, the home appliance ads I mentioned will proceed."

Kim Tae-hyun has a bit of a show-off nature.

And he doesn’t like people who take things for granted, but he really likes polite yet confident people.

Although the intention wasn’t to win his favor, Lee Hyun-woo had heard enough negotiation tips from the planning office in the past.

"I’m really okay with it."

"I'm not. I'm a person who keeps my word."

"If you insist... understood."

The best sales technique is not to force customers.

It is to make them desperately want it.

Today, he achieved that again.

Maybe that's why, as he pressed the buttons on his mobile phone in the parking lot, Lee Hyun-woo's fingers were cheerful.

"Manager Han?"

(Yes, CEO.)

"It seems 【Guseong】 is going to bomb us with ads."

(What?)

"Since it's about home appliances, go quickly. If you mention that I met Director Kim Tae-hyun of 【Guseong Systems】, they’ll confirm and proceed."

(Ah... understood.)

It's always best to strike while the iron is hot.

Just the other day, Nostradamus caught their attention, leading to this progress.

Even if luck played a role, utilizing it effectively is a skill.

Lee Hyun-woo hung up and pressed the button again.

This time, it was Kang Dong-ho.

(Yes, hello?)

"It's me."

(Ah, CEO.)

"Soon, Manager Han Se-jin will go to 【Guseong】 to secure a bundle of home appliance ads."

(Really?)

"Yes, it's certain. As always, we have three major home appliance companies in our country, right?"

Later, they would be referred to as the two major appliance companies, 【Guseong】 and 【GB】, but as of now, they’re called the three major appliance companies along with 【Daejin】.

Of course, there was a reason for saying this, and Kang Dong-ho, being quick-witted, caught on immediately.

(Understood. I’ll subtly mention 【Guseong】's home appliance ads to 【GB】 and 【Daejin】.)

"Yes, then please take care."

At that moment.

As Lee Hyun-woo was on the phone, a car parked next to him, and a familiar woman got out.

Lee Hyun-woo quickly rolled down the window and called her name.

"Ah-young!"

"Huh? You... are you okay?"

"Huh? What?"

"I heard you met oppa."

How did she know that he met her oppa?

Actually, she had her own line.

That's why she rushed over upon hearing that Kim Tae-hyun and Lee Hyun-woo met today.

The reason was simple.

The previous day, Kim Tae-hyun had threatened legal action, as if he would intimidate Lee Hyun-woo when they met.

But the Lee Hyun-woo she saw now was as calm as ever.

Rather, he smiled as he got out of the car and said to her,

"It seems our connection with 【Guseong】 is going to grow."

"What?"

"Your oppa entrusted us with home appliance ads."

"Re... really?"

"Yeah, there are so many types; it’ll be a big help. Should I thank you for this?"

"......?"

"You opened the door with 【Seorabeol Hotel】. Then came 【Guseong】's appliances, so maybe it was your advertising promotion during last Chuseok... or am I mistaken?"

"Ri... right! I did mention it to people during Chuseok. The advertising effect wasn’t bad."

Of course, it was a lie.

She never said such a thing.

Even without advertising, 【Seorabeol Hotel】 was famous as a place for dignitaries and always had the highest reservation rates.

Lee Hyun-woo didn’t think she had done such a thing either.

But he was sure that thanks to her, this opportunity had arisen.

‘Kim Tae-hyun must have asked his sister first?’

Naturally, Kim Ah-young would have said she didn’t know, so Kim Tae-hyun called Lee Hyun-woo to find out directly.

This became an opportunity to get a big advertising contract, so Lee Hyun-woo decided to treat her after work today.

So he asked,

"Do you like soju?"

For a moment, Kim Ah-young’s pupils trembled slightly.

But it was brief, and she soon raised her eyes slightly and nodded.

"Yeah, I don’t dislike it."

"Then I'll buy you soju tonight, if you have time."

"I have a lot of work today, so I'm a bit busy, but I’ll make time. What time and where should I go?"

"I’ll call you again."

"Alright."

"Then, see you later."

"Okay, see you."

Kim Ah-young felt a bit regretful as she watched Lee Hyun-woo leave.

Then she remembered something.

‘Did I ever mention that I secretly enjoy drinking soju?’

Because Lee Hyun-woo brought it up, she doubted herself for a moment.

In conclusion, there was no way she said that.

Except for her secretary, Park Min-sook, no one knew this.

Strangely, Kim Ah-young was drawn to the ordinary in everything.

The same applied to alcohol.

She found the most common drinks more appealing than expensive ones.

Even now, just imagining drinking soju made her mouth water.

‘I guess nothing happened.’

She had come here worried, but seeing that nothing happened and that they even gained something, she felt good.

Without realizing it, she smiled.

These days, Kim Ah-young's emotions were like a roller coaster.

Of course, she was unaware of this.

However, the people around her knew well.

Thus, when Kim Ah-young returned to the hotel, her closest aide, secretary Park Min-sook, hurried out with a startled face.

"Director, did you go to 【Guseong Systems】?"

"No. I didn't go. I just went for a drive because I felt stifled."

In fact, she hadn’t even told Park Min-sook.

She might have guessed, but since she had feigned ignorance many times before, she would likely be easily deceived.

She thought the same would apply to her evening meeting with Lee Hyun-woo, so Kim Ah-young nonchalantly said,

"I'm thinking of going for a drive tonight as well."
