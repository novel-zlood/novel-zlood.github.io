After returning home, Lee Hyun-woo recalled Kim Sung-moo's question.

― If you were a foreign investor, where would you invest?

Out of courtesy, he mentioned only three places, but there were a few more.

Recently, he had met with IT companies like 【Ghost】 and 【Type Soft】.

However, these companies had almost no performance to speak of, so he hesitated to mention them.

‘I need to help them grow more.’

Instead of just shouting that overcoming the foreign exchange crisis is the goal, it seemed more responsible to actively move and show through actions in his second life.

There was something he had been putting off.

It was a blog.

‘I should start Lee Hyun-woo's blog instead of Nostradamus' blog now.’

After hearing Kim Sung-moo's question today, he guessed something else.

Maybe Kim Sung-moo had figured out the identity of Nostradamus.

When looking at the content, there were many things that the blog dealt with.

‘It was the same last time too.’

Having exposed Lee Hyun-woo's thoughts and philosophy in two meetings, it was hard not to be suspicious.

It didn't make him particularly anxious or guilty that Kim Sung-moo found out and that he deceived him.

Because there was nothing like a crime plan written in the blog.

Instead, he wanted to become a more responsible spokesperson for the IT industry.

So he sat down and immediately created the blog.

― Lee Hyun-woo's 【Jungle】

The name of the blog was a declaration of his complete exposure.

Then he started clicking on the pending friend requests one by one.

Of course, they were all ‘yes.’

But there were so many.

After a while, his fingers hurt.

‘Wow, was I this popular?’

He received over a hundred friend requests, and there were still countless people left.

Well, just the employees alone were nearing one hundred fifty.

If it increased just a bit more, he might have to look for another building.

‘Employees, elementary, middle, high school, and college classmates, seniors and juniors, and relatives, it must be people from the IT industry.’

Lee Hyun-woo accepted a few more friend requests and then posted a blog.

― What if you could program in Hangul?

He continued writing the content.

― Have you ever imagined a Hangul programming language that even children can easily access?

I recently met someone who imagined that.

It was CEO Gwak Jin-wook of 【Ghost】.

While having lunch together, I heard his vision.

Computers and the internet should be easy for more people to access.

I completely agree with that.

The same goes for programming.

If there is a programming language that we can learn through self-study, without having to go to college or attend academies, I would love to learn it too.

In that sense, I wish 【Ghost】 success and support CEO Gwak Jin-wook's challenge.

Writing it made him feel relieved.

‘I should have done this earlier.’

* * *

Mornings are really busy.

As soon as he woke up the next day, he ate breakfast and hurried to work, worried he might be late.

Lee Jung-woo, who was about to start school, also hurriedly got into Lee Hyun-woo's car.

“Hyung, I think I should buy a car too.”

“Go ahead.”

In this era, having two cars was something only the rich could afford.

In fact, Lee Hyun-woo was now rich.

This level of ‘flex’ should be allowed, right?

― Ring ring.

That's when Lee Hyun-woo's phone rang.

As Lee Hyun-woo had already started the car,

“Answer the phone for me.”

He asked his younger brother.

“Hello, this is Lee Hyun-woo's phone. Yes? You’re the CEO of 【Ghost】? Hyung, it's CEO Gwak Jin-wook.”

“Tell him I'll contact him later.”

“He's driving right now, so he'll contact you later. Ah, you want to visit the company?”

“That's fine, tell him to come.”

“Yes, please come over.”

After hanging up, Lee Jung-woo asked.

“Hyung, what are you up to again?”

Lee Hyun-woo always tried things outside the norm.

So his curiosity was piqued.

“What do you mean, up to? Didn't I say I met the CEO of 【Ghost】 recently?”

“Then why is he coming back, sounding so excited?”

“That... I think it's because I mentioned him on my blog yesterday?”

“Blog? Hyung, you finally made a blog?”

“Yeah, you sent a friend request, and I accepted it.”

“I see. But was your first post about this person?”

“That's right.”

“Hey, you should talk about our company too.”

“We're already in the spotlight. The media covers us all the time, so why should I?”

It's true.

Since January and February of this year, the media had been keeping a close watch on 【Jungle】 and constantly releasing articles.

Even if it wasn't new content, they would recycle and repeat the news.

Recent news about 【Alta Vista】 and Son Joong-ui had been covered to the point of exhaustion.

But while some viewers might be tired of it, with the rapid spread of high-speed internet, the increase in the user base meant it could be fresh to someone.

Still, it might not have been as fresh as Lee Hyun-woo's blog.

“CEO, have you seen the article?”

Yoo Jin-young asked with a smile before entering the CEO's office.

“Article?”

“Yes, your blog was turned into an article.”

“Really? I posted it just yesterday, where?”

“A new internet newspaper was established recently. It's called 【E-Daily】, and they covered your blog content.”

“Ah...”

He vaguely remembered hearing about it.

‘Come to think of it, the era of internet-only newspapers has also come forward.’

Every time he thought he was ahead of the times in something, a strong sense of satisfaction surged.

This was because the workaholic genes from his past life were flowing within Lee Hyun-woo.

Even though he had drastically reduced his working hours and proposed a new employment model, the identity of a ‘workaholic’ was not easily erased.

So when he sat down, opened the computer, and found the article, he smiled broadly.

『Lee Hyun-woo Supports Hangul Programming Company 【Ghost】!』

It wasn't much content, but from the other party's perspective, being mentioned like this was significant.

In fact, the face of Gwak Jin-wook, who visited soon after, was filled with ‘gratitude.’

* * *

“Thank you so much. I mean it.”

Lee Hyun-woo responded with a smile to the immediate expression of gratitude after exchanging greetings.

“I just expressed my thoughts, that's all.”

“That gave me a lot of courage.”

It was understandable.

Just as Son Joong-ui's mention of 【Jungle】 in the U.S. and Japan led to a flood of investment inquiries, the attention inevitably increased when a ‘celebrity’ in the industry mentioned a name.

Therefore, Lee Hyun-woo decided to give this joy to others as well.

In that sense, there was a need to expand his acquaintances in this industry.

“By the way, CEO Gwak, what about the meeting we briefly discussed last time?”

“That? I've already contacted everyone. And those people said they'd reach out to those they know. About 50 people have already said they'll attend the meeting.”

“Wow, that's a lot. Then let's proceed right away.”

“Right away? When?”

“The sooner, the better.”

“Ah, yes... yes...”

“It’s better to set a date. That way, we can inform everyone.”

“That would be better. If we also know the time and place.”

“The place is our company basement. Oh, I'll show you since you're here.”

Lee Hyun-woo worked quickly.

So, even with the big stone face, it was hard to keep up. Now, they went down to the basement and,

“Wow...”

Only admiration came out.

It was the first time seeing a meeting place made inside a company.

“It can accommodate 50 people.”

“Yes, it can. And there's a karaoke machine, and that... is that...”

“You've seen it a lot in nightclubs, right? It actually works.”

“Really impressive.”

“It's still a long way to go. My dream is to create an internet cafe, a children's playroom and kindergarten, and a hospital within the company.”

“...”

Gwak Jin-wook was repeatedly amazed.

It didn't seem like these were for his enjoyment.

‘I heard this company is employee-friendly, and it really is.’

Gwak Jin-wook had heard rumors about 【Jungle】, but it was only last week and this week that he directly saw Lee Hyun-woo's thoughts.

The more they talked, the more different Lee Hyun-woo seemed.

Naturally, the feeling that arose was,

‘I want to be like him.’

If he succeeded later, Gwak Jin-wook promised to create such a space.

Also, he had no choice but to quickly pursue what his role model Lee Hyun-woo wanted.

* * *

Three days later.

Many young entrepreneurs gathered in the basement of 【Jungle】.

They all had excited faces at the thought of meeting the ‘celebrity’ of this industry, Lee Hyun-woo.

When Lee Hyun-woo appeared, most people had a flushed expression.

The atmosphere changed as well.

It was like meeting a ‘celebrity’ who was hard to approach.

But this was not the atmosphere Lee Hyun-woo wanted.

‘I can't become that uncomfortable aristocrat to these people I just met.’

So he deliberately did not step forward and shook hands with people without any formality.

“Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Hyun-woo, CEO of 【Jungle】.”

Of course, as he shook hands and listened to their voices, it still seemed they regarded him as someone special.

“Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Hyung-do, CEO of 【E-Daily】.”

“Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Yoon-woo, CEO of 【Blue Moon】.”

“Nice to meet you. I'm Jeon Kyung-hoon, CEO of 【Aon】.”

“Nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Sung-woo, CEO of 【Larette】.”

In fact, these were companies Lee Hyun-woo had never heard of.

However, Lee Hyun-woo had a natural memory, so he memorized all their names.

‘The problem is, I don't know what these companies do.’

He knew the identities of 【E-Daily】, which he had read about in an article a few mornings ago, and had some familiarity with 【Ghost】, 【Type Soft】, and others.

But he had never heard of the rest.

They were quite famous in the IT industry, but the reason they were so unfamiliar might be because...

‘Looks like only really small companies came.’

Well, if they were a bit more well-known, they might not have connections with people like Gwak Jin-wook.

That's why they had no choice but to treat Lee Hyun-woo as a ‘celebrity.’

This made him think he needed to lower his stance even more.

― I am just like you!

He needed to convey this message.

So, the prepared drinks were not cocktails or wine but beer, soju, and makgeolli.

After greeting everyone individually, Lee Hyun-woo raised his voice a bit while holding a glass and said,

“Today, I'm going all the way with you! Let's drink and have fun!”

Since his return, Lee Hyun-woo had learned the art of drinking.

Getting drunk was natural, but the closeness it brought couldn't be ignored.

‘Today, I want to get closer to you all.’
