Now, Kim Yoon-soo was listening intently to Lee Hyun-woo, as if he would believe him even if he said he made fermented soybean blocks out of red beans.

He was already known to be easily influenced, and hadn't Lee Hyun-woo helped him sell five computers?

"I'll create the flyers. Honestly, if we share the address of our 【Jungle】 website, customers who visit will check it out, right? Naturally, the number of visitors will increase and more users will participate in the auctions."

Convincing someone who sells offline to go online might seem strange, but this was a common occurrence even in his previous life.

Especially for smartphones, where many businesses operated both offline and online simultaneously.

Moreover, Kim Yoon-soo lacked business acumen.

He needed to be good at attracting customers, but since he wasn’t shameless, distributing flyers seemed like a better option.

Even if that wasn't the case, Lee Hyun-woo was already considering distributing flyers around Yongsan with his younger brother.

Listening to Lee Hyun-woo, Kim Yoon-soo, influenced once again, raised his thick eyebrows and nodded.

"Alright, got it. We get a lot of people looking to buy computers every day, so distributing flyers shouldn't be a problem."

"If things go well, you might be able to sell 100 units this month."

"That would be a record."

"Oh, and while you're at it, include peripheral devices. Those sell quite well too."

Kim Yoon-soo nodded as if he had already considered it.

Seeing this, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and then headed home to start his next plan.

Later, when he mentioned the flyers to Jang Yoo-chul.

"Did you print some?"

"About 120 copies? It's really slow."

At that moment, Lee Jung-woo's voice was also heard.

"Hey, did you settle things with that boss?"

"Why are you here at this hour?"

"I don't know. I'm working during the day and at night. Just pay me for the hours I work at night."

"My goodness..."

"Answer my question. I'm dying of curiosity."

"Boss Kim liked everything I proposed."

"Wow, he really doesn't know how to do business. He's promoting our 【Jungle】, which is basically a competitor to his store?"

The idea to request flyer promotion from Kim Yoon-soo, the boss of 【Won PC】, was, of course, Lee Hyun-woo's.

Lee Jung-woo had said it wouldn't work.

But seeing the results made him look astonished.

"Because he lacks business skills, I proposed it. If I had suggested it to any other boss, they would have laughed it off."

"How many units does he sell in a month?"

"From what I heard, around 50 or 60?"

"That would be tempting. He could potentially double his sales. Our website’s traffic has been insane lately."

"On top of that, he’s not good at deceiving customers and often gets taken advantage of. Unlike other places, his profit per unit is probably lower."

"If it wasn't for the recent boom in the computer market, he might have had to close down."

"Exactly."

In this period of explosive demand, selling just 50 units a month was enough to make a living.

That’s why Kim Yoon-soo wasn’t desperately in need, but human greed saw the booming sales around him, making him unable to refuse Lee Hyun-woo's proposal.

"Then this is a win-win strategy for both of us."

Watching Lee Jung-woo justify it, Lee Hyun-woo smiled bitterly.

But it was close to the truth.

Kim Yoon-soo could benefit from selling more, and Lee Hyun-woo could secure a stable supply source and earn commissions.

For reference, the commission on a PC that leaves a profit of about 300,000 won is only 7,500 won.

But if he sells 100 units, he could earn 750,000 won.

Considering the peripheral devices, he could potentially earn 1,000,000 won in commissions just from Kim Yoon-soo.

‘It's still not enough.’

He couldn’t be satisfied with just around 1,000,000 won.

While it wasn’t a small amount, it was roughly equivalent to the monthly salary of a person employed in this era.

Of course, the total profit from selling three assembled computers and the commission from auctions registered by individual users, excluding Kim Yoon-soo, was estimated to be around 2,000,000 won.

But considering the total investment of 4,000,000 won from his parents?

Plus, with Lee Hyun-woo bearing the costs of electricity and phone bills...

‘There’s still a long way to go.’

Thinking this far, he had something to say to Lee Jung-woo, who was just idling away during the day.

"Should we go to Yongsan together to speed things up?"

"To distribute flyers?"

"Yeah, we should try other areas besides the electronics market where Kim Yoon-soo is."

"It would be noticeable."

"We should just do it shamelessly. The initial struggle will lead to future comfort."

"Okay, let’s go, hyung!"

At that moment, seeing Lee Jung-woo enjoying everything, Lee Hyun-woo briefly reminisced about his previous life.

‘Come to think of it, I also enjoyed working when I first got employed.’

His father also really loved working.

Was workaholism hereditary?

‘That can’t be. You should work hard, but not to the point of damaging your health.’

Whenever he realized he was going too far, Lee Hyun-woo would always put on the brakes.

Even now, as he stepped outside with the flyers, he warned his younger brother.

"Let’s set a time limit."

"What time limit?"

"We’ll only distribute for two hours. Got it?"

"Why do you keep changing your mind? Just a moment ago, you said the current struggle would lead to future comfort?"

"Efficiency is important too. You work at night as well. So, let’s just distribute for two hours."

"Ch… okay. Dad always said to endure hardships while young."

"Yeah, I grew up hearing that too..."

He stopped just before he could say, and then he died from overwork.

Instead.

"We’re working hard now. Let’s do it passionately when it’s time. Got it?"

Lee Jung-woo nodded.

In reality, the two brothers went to Yongsan and diligently distributed the flyers.

Even if they ended up in the trash, if just 10% of the recipients checked the site, that would be something.

‘After hardship comes happiness.’

Lee Hyun-woo, muttering inwardly, saw his younger brother sweating while distributing the flyers.

He earnestly hoped that this enthusiasm would be rewarded later.

* * *

The flyers distributed by Lee Hyun-woo and Lee Jung-woo from time to time, or those distributed by Kim Yoon-soo at his shop.

Whether these directly translated to an increase in visitors was uncertain, but just like a snowball getting bigger as it rolls, the 【Jungle】 site was bustling with life each day.

Naturally, this resulted in fierce competition to win bids for Kim Yoon-soo's computers and peripherals.

"Including the first five units, all 60 units were sold within a week!"

Lee Jung-woo shouted excitedly, bringing a smile to Lee Hyun-woo's face.

Jang Yoo-chul didn’t stay quiet either.

"Some of those were high-spec computers."

"Right. One was sold for 1.7 million won."

"Hyung, isn’t this the turning point?"

"Though it’s too early to be complacent, it’s a fairly satisfactory result."

Lee Hyun-woo pretended to remain calm.

He didn't want Lee Jung-woo and Jang Yoo-chul to become overconfident.

But internally, he was brimming with confidence.

Lee Hyun-woo began considering approaching other stores.

"From now on, we should look into home appliances, not just computers."

"What? How?"

"I have a plan. I’ll be back in a bit."

Lee Hyun-woo stood up, and the two looked at him with curious eyes.

But recently, Lee Hyun-woo avoided speaking unless he was sure.

Even now, his eyes seemed to say.

‘I’ll let you know if I succeed.’

After stepping outside, he took a deep breath.

This was a habit of Lee Hyun-woo whenever he was firming his resolve.

Soon, he headed to Yongsan.

However, he arrived at a place slightly away from the electronics market, stopping in front of a sign that read 【Sangil Enterprise】.

‘It’s still here.’

【Sangil Enterprise】 was a place he frequently visited during his early days as a new employee in his previous life.

Since he was living a second life, he didn’t know what butterfly effects might occur.

He thought it might not be there, but seeing the sign made him inexplicably happy.

‘Let’s get started then.’

After firming his resolve once more, he entered, taking in the warehouse-like scenery.

There were people busily moving goods onto trucks, as well as those unloading them.

This place collected return appliances and resold them to trading companies.

【Deokseong Trading】 also bought return appliances here and sold them overseas.

It was a misconception that trading companies only sold new products.

In fact, returned and used products often made more money.

These were items that were in good quality but had been returned due to opened packaging or minor scratches.

Lee Hyun-woo soon entered the office located at one side of the warehouse.

"Is anyone here?"

"Who’s there?"

A middle-aged man with bulging eyes responded right away.

Lee Hyun-woo greeted him with a friendly smile.

Then, he approached the bulging-eyed middle-aged man and unexpectedly handed him a business card.

The bulging-eyed man reluctantly took it, frowning.

A disinterested voice followed.

"【Jungle】?"

"Yes, it’s an online auction site."

The bulging-eyed middle-aged man placed the business card on his desk and tilted his head.

He then asked Lee Hyun-woo disinterestedly.

"So what?"

His eyes showed a hint of disregard.

Still, Lee Hyun-woo didn't lose his smile.

This was a fundamental principle of sales.

It was natural to get cold reactions when meeting clients.

Time is money. Therefore, one shouldn’t take up too much of a busy person’s time.

Instead, it’s best to convey the core points briefly and gauge the atmosphere.

"I’d like to list Sangil Enterprise’s products on our auction site. If the auction results are good, it will be more profitable than supplying to trading companies."

Money and profit.

Even for non-business people, these topics pique interest. What about the bulging-eyed man?

His initial expression of dealing with a peddler significantly softened.

"If you don’t believe me, there’s a place called Won PC in the Yongsan electronics market. The owner is Mr. Kim Yoon-soo. He started auctions last week and achieved about 80 million won in sales."

"80 million won?"

Seeing the bulging eyes grow even bigger, Lee Hyun-woo silently cheered.

‘Originally, I planned to convey everything in 3 minutes…’

He gained confidence that he could take up more of the other person’s time.

He had experienced this bulging-eyed middle-aged man in his previous life.

Though grumpy at first, once a deal was made, he rarely changed partners.

Knowing the other person’s character was half the battle won.

As expected, the bulging-eyed middle-aged man’s curiosity was piqued.

"Alright, let’s hear it."

Naturally, Lee Hyun-woo’s face broke into a smile.
