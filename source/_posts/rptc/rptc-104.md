This morning, Lee Hyun-woo received a call from Kim Ah-young on his way to work.

Since he was planning to drop by Kim Sung-moo’s house after work, he gladly pressed the call button, and she said she was coming to Jungle.

‘Is she worried about me?’

Lee Hyun-woo, who has lived for half a century and returned to the past.

He had met all kinds of people and experienced tremendous events, and he managed to navigate through those situations successfully, so even the head of Guseong Group couldn't take the lead in conversations and set the tone.

But would Kim Ah-young understand these circumstances?

A little later, she approached Lee Hyun-woo with a flushed face as she saw him in front of the company.

Lee Hyun-woo still had a relaxed expression.

"Did you wait outside in the cold? Let's go up."

"Huh? Oh, okay."

Even in the CEO's office, he personally brewed coffee and handed a mug to Kim Ah-young with a soft voice.

"Here is your warm morning coffee."

"Thanks."

Kim Ah-young took the cup he handed her and warmed her hands.

But without taking a sip, she urgently asked Lee Hyun-woo,

"You said you're coming to our house today, right?"

"Yes, that's right. I heard the chairman wants to meet me."

"Yeah, I was surprised when my father mentioned it this morning. I'm curious why he suddenly wants to see you; I'm a bit worried."

"Don't worry too much. There's only one reason."

Kim Ah-young's eyes widened like a rabbit's.

"Huh? What is it?"

"The identity of Nostradamus. It seems he wants to know about it."

"Really? How do you know that?"

"It's a hunch. But the reason I have this feeling is because the last time your oppa wanted to see me, it was for the same reason. And you were the same before."

Kim Ah-young briefly reminisced about the past.

Upon reflection, it was true.

"That's right."

"This time, I'll ask. Why is your family so curious about Nostradamus?"

"Well...."

Kim Ah-young couldn't easily answer.

Then Lee Hyun-woo shared his opinion.

"I think it's because they have a strong desire to grasp and control information. In the business world, there's a saying. The information of Guseong is at the level of the National Intelligence Service."

"Is there really such a saying?"

"Of course. This saying is known among the public and even to journalists."

Although slightly exaggerated, it was close to the truth.

Kim Sung-moo, as well as the previous founder, highly valued information.

In the past, organizations that held such information belonged to the state.

But gradually, conglomerate groups started to seize information, and eventually, they even merged with media companies skilled in handling information.

For a simple example, just mentioning the relationship between Guseong Group and Sejong Ilbo would make people nod in agreement.

"That's why they are curious about the existence of Nostradamus. Moreover, it's not just an ordinary blogger; the information provided is beyond imagination. It's not only accurate about domestic information but also about international information."

"Now I see..."

Kim Ah-young nodded as if she finally understood and looked intently at Lee Hyun-woo.

"Then what will you say if my father asks about the identity of Nostradamus?"

"Well, I haven't decided yet."

"So, it means you know who Nostradamus is."

"Of course, I do."

After a brief pause, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and spoke again.

"It's me."

"What?"

"I'm Nostradamus."

"...!"

Kim Ah-young's eyes danced in disbelief.

She was so shocked that she asked Lee Hyun-woo again.

"You're Nostradamus?"

"Yes, it's me. And now, besides me, the only person who knows this is..."

"..."

"Only you."

The shock began to blend with a sweet emotion.

She wanted to smile because she felt good, but she held back and said,

"So, you might tell my father that you are Nostradamus."

"Maybe, maybe not. But if I do tell him, it would be very troublesome."

"You're right. And he might not like it very much. So, Hyun-woo...."

At this point, she seemed to have made up her mind, took a deep breath, and continued.

"I just thought of this, but tell my father that I am Nostradamus."

"Huh?"

This time, Lee Hyun-woo's eyes widened.

Kim Ah-young explained why he should reveal her as Nostradamus.

"If you tell him that, it might save you from trouble."

"That could be true, but what about you? Some of the things Nostradamus mentioned are related to Guseong. There's also the case with the Boham Group...."

"I know. I might get scolded a bit. I can handle that."

"They will also ask for your motives. Why did you do it?"

"Well...."

Since it was a spontaneous decision, she couldn't answer Lee Hyun-woo’s question.

Maybe that’s why Lee Hyun-woo quickly helped her.

"Tell them you wanted to understand the economic trends both domestically and internationally."

"Huh?"

"Predicting the strong dollar and Japan's financial policies was a remarkable feat. The chairman will be amazed at your intuition."

"That's true. But knowing my father, I don't think he will ask for a reason."

"Really?"

"He will either say don't do it or do it. It will be one of the two, without any explanation."

Lee Hyun-woo nodded.

Come to think of it, he had seen similar words in Kim Sung-moo’s autobiography.

— My father always accompanied me to the front lines of management and ordered me to do many things directly. But he never explained them in detail.

Perhaps Kim Sung-moo was educating his children in the same way his father, the founder, had taught him?

‘I’m not sure if it’s similar, but one thing is certain.’

Nostradamus needs to be sealed from now on.

Anyway, after talking with Kim Ah-young, Lee Hyun-woo visited Kim Sung-moo's house in the evening and revealed the identity of Nostradamus.

* * *

Kim Sung-moo, who rarely showed surprise, widened his eyes and seemed to be at a loss for words for a moment.

But this was brief; as expected, the giant showed a different reaction.

Kim Sung-moo naturally changed the topic and discussed domestic and international situations with Lee Hyun-woo.

After the solo meeting in the office ended, Kim Sung-moo said he hoped to see him again, to which Lee Hyun-woo responded with a smile.

“Lunar New Year is coming soon. It might be late, but I wish you a Happy New Year in advance.”

“Come to pay your respects next time.”

“Yes, I will.”

Lee Hyun-woo laughed at the ambiguous term "next time."

He didn't know if it meant the upcoming Lunar New Year or next year.

‘This family celebrates the Solar New Year.’

In any case, seeing each other frequently is essential to changing the mindset of the head of a conglomerate.

Thinking that he should approach this with an "if it doesn't work out, never mind" attitude, he left the room.

* * *

When Lee Hyun-woo came out of the office, the people of the house gathered around again.

Among them, Kim Tae-hyun asked,

“Is it over?”

“Yes, haha.”

“Shall we have a little chat?”

“Sure.”

It was now time to talk with Kim Tae-hyun.

At that moment,

“A-young, come in for a moment.”

Kim Sung-moo calling Kim Ah-young caught everyone's attention, including Lee Hyun-woo’s.

Naturally, people were curious.

Why did Kim Sung-moo, who had just met Lee Hyun-woo alone, suddenly call Kim Ah-young?

What did they talk about?

Especially, the second daughter, Kim A-jin, and the youngest, Kim Na-yoon, had wild imaginations.

‘Is it possible that father liked this guy and is encouraging my sister to date him?’

On the other hand, Kim Tae-hyun, who was interested in a different topic, pulled Lee Hyun-woo to his room and asked related questions.

“What did you say? Why is he calling An-young suddenly? Is there a problem with our joint venture in Japan?”

“No way. I just received a call from Japan today, saying that progress is faster than expected and that we might start the portal site and online shopping next month.”

“That’s good news. Then why is father calling An-young?”

Lee Hyun-woo quickly shrugged.

“I really don’t know.”

“Really?”

“Yes, our conversation was mostly about the economic trends domestically and internationally.”

Although it was true, he didn't mention revealing the identity of Nostradamus.

Even if Kim Tae-hyun found out later, he wouldn’t feel bad.

His sibling was the one who hid more from Lee Hyun-woo, so the feeling of betrayal would likely be directed in that direction.

‘But isn’t this making An-young take too much upon herself?’

It wasn’t the desired direction, and there was no need for Kim Ah-young to go this far.

‘I feel bad for her.’

Lee Hyun-woo thought he should do something nice for Kim Ah-young later.

Also, through this, he could read Kim Ah-young’s feelings once more.

‘She definitely has feelings for me.’

On his way home after talking with Kim Tae-hyun, he briefly indulged in imagination.

What if he had a ‘passionate romance’ with Kim Ah-young?

Firstly, he would always have a bodyguard with him.

Secondly, Chairman Kim Sung-moo might recommend studying abroad to him.

Thirdly, Guseong might start the process of absorbing Jungle.

Fourthly, the eldest son, Kim Tae-hyun, might keep a close watch on him.

Although these conclusions were ‘might happen,’ it wasn't entirely impossible.

At least in his previous life, the person who became Kim Ah-young’s husband had to study abroad due to Kim Sung-moo’s insistence and endured tremendous stress to qualify as a son-in-law.

‘Oh dear, I need to think this through a bit more.’

Lee Hyun-woo suddenly felt that troublesome things might come his way and took a deep breath.

Even though he dreamed of a passionate romance in his new life, he didn't want to achieve it while being very troubled.

With these thoughts, as soon as he reached home, his phone rang.

‘It must be A-young.’

His premonition pointed to her, and indeed, it was Kim Ah-young when he answered the call.

(Hyun-woo, it’s me.)

“Oh, A-young.”

Lee Hyun-woo was curious.

What did Kim Sung-moo talk about with her?

‘Did he really not ask why she did that?’

But he decided to wait until Kim Ah-young shared.

Anyway, he didn’t have to wait long.

Kim Ah-young immediately told Lee Hyun-woo about her conversation with Kim Sung-moo.

(I called because I thought you might be worried. Father asked if I was Nostradamus and didn’t say much else.)

“Really?”

(Yes, he didn’t say not to do it either. Instead, he said he trusts me.)

“Ah….”

Once again, the contents of Kim Sung-moo’s autobiography came to mind.

Although he loved all his children, Kim Sung-moo especially cherished his eldest daughter.

When Kim Ah-young first joined to inherit the hotel, he stayed at Seorabeol Hotel for a month, openly showing his concern.

It was very rare for him to give such support to his own child.

It never happened with his eldest son, Kim Tae-hyun, or his second daughter, Kim A-jin.

‘This wasn’t favoritism but a result of feeling sorry for not being able to be there for A-young during her childhood compared to his other children.’

Unlike her siblings, Kim Ah-young's childhood was during a time when Kim Sung-moo was fiercely fighting for succession and couldn't pay much attention to her.

She must have been his sore spot since then, and later, her marriage and divorce with a bodyguard would have only deepened that feeling.

‘Thinking about it this way, I feel sorry for A-young.’

It was a fleeting moment, but these thoughts occurred to him.

After these thoughts ended, he felt he should treat her well.

Like this, Lee Hyun-woo wavered.

Why? Because relationships between men and women never go as planned.
