When Jung Sung-woo, the representative of 【Alpha Cast】, first came with some anxiety,

But when he saw the current 【Jungle Music】 website, his expression quickly changed.

Should I say his eyes were filled with excitement and anticipation?

Seeing that, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and asked,

“Representative, when will the prototype be ready?”

“Of course… um…”

“You don’t have to rush too much. The website will probably launch sooner than the prototype anyway. Since it's already delayed, please make it well.”

“I’ll do my best to speed it up.”

“Oh, and when the website is up, please check it frequently. You’ll need it for reference.”

There were several reasons for mentioning this.

‘The paradigm of selling music is about to change.’

The format will shift from albums with about ten tracks to single albums with a few tracks.

As the head of a company that makes MP3 players, he should quickly catch this changing paradigm.

It could also affect motivation.

If Jung Sung-woo watches the verification process of 【Jungle Music】 in real-time, it’s evident that the Korean characteristic of ‘ppalli-ppalli’ (hurry-hurry) work will accelerate.

So, Lee Hyun-woo subtly used the carrot-and-stick approach today.

‘But that doesn’t mean we can relax.’

To be more certain, an environment where MP3 players are released and sell like hotcakes needs to be created.

So after Jung Sung-woo left, he asked Woo Sang-won,

“There’s no issue with the ADSL speed, right?”

“I’m quite satisfied.”

“Then we should inform 【DaeHan Power】.”

“Someone already come every day to check the speed.”

“The downside of public enterprises is that it takes a long time to go from bottom to top.”

“That’s true…”

Woo Sang-won is also from 【Hi】, a subsidiary of DaeHan Telecom.

He couldn’t be unaware of its workings.

The reason Woo Sang-won’s previous company fell behind 【Jungle】 is also because of its slow decision-making structure, isn’t it?

Suddenly curious about Lee Hyun-woo’s thoughts, he asked,

“So what should we do?”

“I’ll have to meet the higher-ups myself.”

“What?”

“I need to tell the higher-ups to hurry up and install it. That’s the only way our 【Jungle Music】 will change the music industry as soon as it’s launched, isn’t it?”

Woo Sang-won’s eyes wavered and then changed to ‘understanding.’

‘It’s not impossible...’

Lee Hyun-woo is not someone to be underestimated anymore.

In other words, he is the head of the most successful innovative company in the country.

Who would deny that he has the right to meet the top executives of 【DaeHan Power】?

‘The problem is his age.’

Is it the ingrained prejudice of Korean society?

Or should it be called a sort of glass ceiling?

Unless he’s a second-generation chaebol, there’s a possibility that the 27-year-old Lee Hyun-woo’s words wouldn’t be taken seriously by the ‘old guards.’

Interestingly, Lee Hyun-woo had already read Woo Sang-won’s thoughts.

“Of course, I know that a stimulus is needed to move the higher-ups.”

“A stimulus?”

“【DaeHan Power】 providing ADSL service this time is due to public opinion, isn’t it?”

“So you’re saying you’ll move public opinion again?”

“Yes, that’s right. First, I think we need to rearrange the news section that appears when we open our portal’s webpage.”

“What do you mean?”

“Currently, there are politics, economy, society, culture, entertainment, and sports. Let’s add information and communication.”

The top news article on the portal's main page is exposed to hot topics in each field.

Information and communication news were included in the economy section and often pushed aside by other news.

“You mean to expose information and communication news as the top article on the main page.”

“That’s right.”

“But there’s so little information and communication news that the rotation won’t be smooth.”

“That’s exactly the point.”

“Exactly the point?”

“Since there’s not much news, we’ll keep showing ADSL-related news in the most prominent spot.”

“Oh…”

“And the news will be produced by reporters, right? They need to interview someone to get story.”

This meant he would personally go out for interviews soon.

Since moving the building, people have continuously visited 【Jungle】, and it seems this time there will be quite a few visitors as well.

* * *

Lee Hyun-woo, synonymous with driving force.

From the day he talked to Woo Sang-won, he decided to call in the reporters right away.

Of course, only a few reporters came when called, but most could be summoned with a few simple words.

Lee Hyun-woo called in front of Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho, who need to work with him on this.

“Hello? Reporter Heo? Ah, I heard you moved to the economic department this time? The thing is, I want to do an interview.”

His voice was very confident.

It was as if he was granting them the favor of an interview.

News is a place where new information is circulated.

Lee Hyun-woo continues to explain why he’s acting as if he’s doing the reporter a favor by giving an interview.

“Our 【Jungle】 recently signed an investment agreement with Son Jung-yi from 【Software Bank】. And we’re on the verge of signing a mutual business cooperation contract with 【AltaVista】. Ah, we’ve also been contacted by 【Diamond Fund】 and 【Nobuyuki Securities】 wanting to invest. Of course, we’re not thinking of taking all of it… Oh, I’m talking too much. Anyway, there are so many stories to tell that you must come.”

After hearing the conversation, the two people in front of him started contacting the reporters they knew at a copy-and-paste level.

The ones who originally frequented the press were not Lee Hyun-woo, but these two people.

Lee Hyun-woo merely contacted the reporter he had previously interviewed with.

In other words, he was educating them that this level of action is acceptable.

What’s important here is not clinging to the reporters but throwing out plenty of bait to make them come.

Lee Hyun-woo soon listened to people’s voices.

“Hello. Ah, Reporter Kim? I’m calling because I’m worried that you might not come and got left by other reporters. Our representative is going to do an interview. He’s been invited by 【Dachshund Institute】 in Germany and 【Stanford University】.”

“Reporter Cho? There will be an interview at our headquarters the day after tomorrow. Ah, several newspapers keep asking our representative for interviews. Oh? Didn’t you know? Then check 【Yaho】. It says there that Son Jung-yi is investing in 【Jungle】.”

Listening from the side, they apply it well.

Sometimes, there were reporters who already knew this fact.

“You knew? Then you haven’t heard about other investments, right?”

“You saw that article? If you come this time, you’ll get a lot of good information. You should properly cover it, rather than just translating the English version of the article on 【Yaho】.”

When did they grow so much?

It’s really gratifying.

Lee Hyun-woo smiled broadly.

‘I initially wanted to refrain from interviews, but I have no choice.’

When his face keeps getting known, it feels like his freedom is restricted.

But for the work of changing the world, this much seems necessary.

The interesting part was what came next.

Somehow, calls came in after hearing the news.

“Moshimoshi? Hi. Hi. 【Nihon Keizai】? Hi. Um… Hi.”

It was immediately foreign press.

The phone calls from foreign correspondents in Korea were received by Kang Dong-ho and then handed over to Lee Hyun-woo.

It wasn’t just one; they kept coming in.

“Hello? 【Washington Post】?”

The surrounding employees once again confirmed that Lee Hyun-woo was fluent in both Japanese and English.

Thus, it seemed that the interview would unexpectedly turn into a multinational one, with foreign reporters from the U.S., Japan, and Germany coming as well.

And two days later.

Finally, many reporters visited 【Jungle】.

* * *

Now, 【Jungle】 is not a small company.

The fact that there were quite a few guide staff proved this, and the reporters were guided to the basement.

As soon as they went down, they noticed the already arranged seats.

However, some reporters who had been looking around noticed the foreign reporters already seated and their eyes sparkled.

‘What? That’s a correspondent from the 【Washington Post】?’

‘Isn’t that Nakamura Shinjo from 【Nihon Keizai】?’

‘They even came from Germany? Is it true that he’s attending a forum hosted by 【Dachshund Institute】?’

Recalling the information they had heard previously, the reporters’ eyes moved.

“Hello, everyone!”

Finally, Lee Hyun-woo opened the door and came in.

Looking at him, the reporters thought his orange hair suited him quite well.

Moreover, his bright smile and confident stride gave the impression that he might have been influenced by foreign culture.

Of course, they already knew from checking Lee Hyun-woo’s educational and career backgrounds that this wasn’t the case, but the 27-year-old seemed like a rare breed in Korea.

Lee Hyun-woo grabbed the microphone.

“This place used to be a café during the day and a nightclub at night. Today, we’ve slightly adjusted the space to provide it as an interview venue for you. How… do you find it comfortable?”

His voice was full of ease.

Some nodded, and some women even responded in sweet voices. The more astonishing part was that he then said the same thing in English and Japanese.

‘Wow, his English is good. It’s native level!’

‘He’s proficient in Japanese too.’

‘He’s talented in at least three languages and good-looking. Why is the world so unfair?’

Some thought he might have memorized it.

But soon after, when foreign reporters asked questions,

“Is it true that you are co-hosting a forum at 【Stanford University】?”

“Yes, it is. And at this forum, we plan to discuss the impact of internet speed on the openness of information. It’s likely to be scheduled for early next year.”

“They say 【Diamond Fund】 is investing. Can you tell us the scale of the investment?”

“We have many options because there’s more than one place offering to invest. It’s a good thing. But indiscriminate investment is not necessarily good. The philosophies and beliefs of the management can be swayed by the principles of capitalism.”

Watching him answer freely, one couldn’t help but be amazed at Lee Hyun-woo’s foreign language skills.

Is there anything more surprising?

There is.

“Reporters, isn’t today really interesting? I only contacted one person, and our two team leaders only contacted some of the reporters they knew. But look at how many people are here. And there are foreign reporters too. It make me feel like the world really has changed. The speed of information delivery is incredibly fast compared to before.”

“……”

“I now argue that we need to attach rockets to this speed of information delivery. In other words, I’m talking about changing the speed of the world. That’s ADSL.”

He uses a speech style that reporters love.

That is, subtly hinting at the core headline within the content of the conversation.

Because of this, the article titles that come out after the interview are exactly what Lee Hyun-woo wanted.

『Lee Hyun-woo Discusses ADSL and Changing the Speed of the World!』
