Nonetheless, we must not forget the identity of Nostradamus, who writes editorials.

In other words, the Nostradamus known to the public is an economic expert.

Therefore, I highlighted the economic impact caused by AI.

Lee Hyun-woo referenced a report from the world's top management consulting firm that he read before he died.

- In 30 years, AI will affect all industries, and the resulting economic impact will reach 100 trillion dollars.

At the time of his death, it was written to be about 10 years later, so it seems he wrote it to match approximately.

After writing up to this point, he sent it to Jang Jae-won via email.

It will probably be reviewed, edited, and posted in a few days.

"Writing editorials these days is incredibly fun."

Is this the taste of a second character?

He couldn't wait for the game his younger brother was developing to be completed, so he could showcase the exploits of his second character in the online battlefield.

* * *

The next day, Oh Min-woo visited from the morning.

"CEO, what should we do about Jung-hyun?"

"Jung-hyun? Ah, Lee Jung-hyun?"

Lee Hyun-woo immediately recalled the high school hacker who had recently caused quite a stir.

Given the current situation of being indicted without detention, he would likely be punished.

"It’s unlikely he’ll just get a warning... He might end up in a juvenile detention center."

"That's possible, and considering he's a minor, he might just get probation."

"Probation?"

"Yeah, it means an appropriate level of punishment."

"Wow, you're so knowledgeable."

"No, honestly, I don't know much about the law either. So, probation is just my personal guess."

"Anyway, he'll get a record, right?"

"Probably."

"Still, I want to bring him in. You'll allow it, right?"

"We need to see his character first."

"I visited him for a few days, and he's not a bad guy. Deep down, he's a good person."

"Do you believe in the goodness of human nature?"

"Please trust me. If he causes any problems later, I'll take responsibility."

"Of course. Then I'll trust you and hire him. It's your responsibility."

"......"

"Why are you silent?"

"You're too harsh."

"Why? You said you'd take responsibility, so I'm holding you to your word. It means manage him well."

Honestly, although he told Oh Min-woo to take responsibility, the ultimate responsibility for any problems in the company lay with the CEO, Lee Hyun-woo.

Despite this, he emphasized it to instill a sense of responsibility.

"Yes, yes. I'll do that. Wow, you're so cold."

"If it came off that way, I'm sorry... but this is a company, so I have no choice. If it were on a personal level, I would have let it slide."

"Yes, yes, I understand."

Oh Min-woo grumbled slightly, feeling a bit dissatisfied with Lee Hyun-woo's decisive tone.

Just then.

Knock, knock.

A knocking sound interrupted their conversation.

"Yes."

"CEO, Joe Murphy, the CEO of Jungle USA, is here."

"Let him in."

"I'll take my leave."

"No, stay."

"Why?"

"Joe Murphy asked recently about the progress of 'make friends'. You need to answer him."

"That means, since I'm in charge, I need to take responsibility."

"Of course."

Indeed, after Joe Murphy came in and exchanged brief greetings, Lee Hyun-woo handed over the explanation of the 'make friends' progress to Oh Min-woo.

"It's almost done. Korea will probably start in September, so please send your developers."

"Ah, yes. Understood. And..."

After hearing Oh Min-woo's brief response, Joe Murphy looked at Lee Hyun-woo.

"I just met 'Woo', and he said the web browser will also be launched on September 1st..."

"Ah, yes. That's correct."

Although Lee Hyun-woo hadn't deeply reviewed the internal updates regarding the fair hosted by the 21st Century Venture Association, he had directly heard reports about the web browser launch.

"Then we need to prepare an English version as well."

A web browser is a window to view the internet.

If Macro Soft developed the operating system Windows, which serves as a window to view computers, then the upcoming war of web browsers, crossing national borders, would commence.

Of course, so far, Macro Soft has the upper hand, but Joe Murphy seemed unwilling to back down.

"The current market share war among web browsers is fierce. Some say Macro Soft's 'Internet Ex Cross' will win, but nothing is certain yet."

These words influenced Oh Min-woo, who was listening quietly.

"If we launch ours, the three kingdoms' war of web browsers will begin."

Currently, aside from 'Internet Ex Cross', 'Navigator' had also established itself as a competitor.

Hearing his confident declaration of entering the fray, Lee Hyun-woo could only smile.

'That could happen, or maybe not.'

Suddenly, Woo Sang-won's words came to mind.

He wasn't overly optimistic about the upcoming web browser, but he believed it would evolve continuously based on user feedback.

However, upon examining the new web browser, Lee Hyun-woo was not entirely without expectations.

Considering its fast execution and response speed, it seemed perfect for the impatient Korean users.

'Come to think of it, it resembles that.'

An image suddenly popped into his mind.

Jungle's web browser 'Forest' overlapped with the web browser 'Cron' released by Single in his previous life.

Naturally, a blueprint formed.

Perhaps in this life, 'Forest' would serve the role of 'Cron'.

* * *

After Joe Murphy, Son Jung-yi visited.

"Did you find a good place the other day?"

"Of course. Thank you for the invitation."

"No, it was mutually beneficial."

Son Jung-yi gained from investing in promising places, and venture companies gained momentum by meeting investors.

It could be said to be a win-win, but Son Jung-yi's expression was filled with regret.

There was a reason.

"However, I envy how rapidly Korea's dot-com ecosystem is changing."

IT entrepreneurs couldn't help but envy the current state of Korea.

With an internet infrastructure different today than yesterday, as Son Jung-yi said, the IT ecosystem was evolving to continually give birth to new dot-com companies.

"Especially, the variety of online shopping malls is astounding. There are places that conduct auctions or mediate between sellers and buyers, like Jungle, and even specialized online malls for books and clothes. There are even sites that handle travel, lodging, artwork, and second-hand luxury goods."

"I was surprised by that as well. However, isn't a decent online shopping mall about to appear in Japan too?"

"Yes, hahaha. That would be Jungle Shopping, so CEO Lee, you will become even wealthier."

Finally, Jungle's online shopping mall was about to debut in Japan.

The biggest advantage of online shopping malls is the low price of products.

This would undoubtedly win the favor of Japanese consumers.

Of course, time was needed.

In Korea, it took more than a year for the current Jungle Shopping to establish itself.

In fact, it still couldn't be said to be fully settled.

Lee Hyun-woo, having experienced much larger-scale companies like Amazones or Coupon in his previous life, couldn't help but think there was a long way to go.

"I heard you're going public as well."

"That might be Jungle Japan first."

"Who knows, there might be a hitch in the middle. Hahaha."

"How could that be?"

"Anyway, if you raise funds through the IPO, what will you do first... May I ask?"

It was a cautious voice.

It was natural, as it was akin to asking about the future items or content Lee Hyun-woo was preparing.

However, Lee Hyun-woo was unhesitant.

"Well, I'm currently fascinated by AI, but by then, I'll be pondering what to do next. Ah, I also want to build the logistics infrastructure you mentioned before, Chairman Son."

"Ah, yes. I'm the same. But if it's AI...?"

"It stands for Artificial Intelligence."

"Ah... okay..."

This time, there was no admiration in Son Jung-yi's eyes.

It felt too distant, like chasing a mirage.

It didn't matter.

It wasn't about refining future technological advancements to impress someone.

Eventually, the rest of the conversation repeated the content previously discussed with Joe Murphy.

Son Jung-yi was also interested in 'make friends' and the new Jungle web browser 'Forest'.

'It seems he can see a few years ahead, but not decades.'

Seeing Son Jung-yi's reaction, it seemed likely that the editorial would be quite dull for people.

* * *

Indeed, when the editorial was published a few days later, other articles hardly quoted Nostradamus.

Realizing once again that the near future is more visible than the distant future, a sense of determination arose.

If it's not visible, make it visible.

Lee Hyun-woo sought out his younger brother again.

"Can you make a Go game with the AI you mentioned last time?"

"A Go game?"

"Yeah, I want to develop an AI Go player that gradually improves through machine learning."

Seeing his brother suddenly make a strange request, Lee Jung-woo tilted his head.

"I'll be busy, but I can make one."

"Well, honestly, it doesn't seem too difficult. But for machine learning, it needs continuous opponents."

"That's not a problem. It can play against people in online matches."

"Oh? Online matches? You mean playing Go online? That reminds me of an online battlefield."

Although that wasn't the initial intention, the online Go matches could serve as a rehearsal for the online battlefield of the Space Craft game Lee Jung-woo mentioned.

"That’s not a bad idea."

Although the Go-playing population was decreasing over time, over 35% of people knew how to play Go in this era.

Famous Go players were also in their prime during this era.

Originally, he wanted a Go AI program like AlphaGo from Single, but it unexpectedly turned into an online Go match game.

'Well, that's not bad either.'

A phrase already came to mind.

- Challenge Lee Chang-ho, the best Go player in Korea, at 9-dan!

Of course, it couldn't be done immediately, but as mentioned to his brother earlier, the AI Go player would gradually improve by defeating skilled players through machine learning.

Without knowing his brother's intentions, Lee Jung-woo took out his phone.

"Hey, it's me. How about we make a new game while waiting for the design?"

The person on the other end was one of the developers working on the game.

Lee Jung-woo's game, the Korean version of Space Craft, was currently in character design.

In the meantime, inspired by Lee Hyun-woo, Lee Jung-woo wanted to quickly create an online Go match game.

"A Go game. Yeah, a Go game. Playing online. I don't know, but my brother said he wants to develop an AI Go player. Let's leave that to him, and we'll create an online match game to make waves in the industry. What do you think?"

But why did more game ideas pop into Lee Hyun-woo's head as he listened to the phone conversation?

Online Go-Stop, online poker, online blackjack, and so on.
