Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young's honeymoon was in Hawaii.

As they traveled, the clear sky and the Pacific Ocean gave them a feeling of purification.

Additionally, since they would be living in Jeju Island anyway, they thought it would be fine to use the 14 nights and 15 days in Hawaii as a rehearsal.

The advantages were clear. Meeting picturesque natural landscapes everywhere would quickly heal their weary hearts and inspire great ideas.

Although they couldn't directly compare the climates, they thought it would be okay since it was warmer than the inland.

The fact that the living space was small and allowed for efficient movement, and the opportunity to enjoy hobbies in nature, were not bad points either.

Above all, it was different from the time Lee Hyun-woo lived in the 21st century, so if he put his mind to it, he could change Jeju Island like playing SimCity.

"Yeah, I was planning to create a Silicon Beach anyway."

Compared to these advantages, the disadvantages were also clear.

Being on an island, things related to daily life, including transportation, could be inconvenient.

But that was all, and he thought they were aspects he could compromise on while living.

"However, if it’s connected to business, it’s a huge deal."

The only issue was foreign business trips. There were hardly any direct flights except to nearby Asian countries.

"Then instead of me going out, I can make others come to me, right?"

The problem was solved this simply.

Even though it seemed like he had organized a lot about "living in Jeju Island," in reality, he was just enjoying the honeymoon in Hawaii and occasionally putting these thoughts in his head.

Moreover, spending 14 nights and 15 days with his beloved made him think only of positive aspects at the moment.

On the way back, he said to Kim Ah-young,

"Living in Jeju Island will be inconvenient at first, but I'll gradually change it."

At these words, Kim Ah-young nodded with a smile.

And she said,

"You don't need to change it. As long as you’re there."

Well, he wondered if she would think the same once they faced the reality of married life.

* * *

After the honeymoon, the couple first visited Kim Sung-moo's house. The plan was to spend a night there, another night at Lee Hyun-woo's family home, and then go to Jeju Island.

"Welcome!"

"Welcome."

"You got quite tanned."

"Welcome."

"Unnie is very happy. She can't stop smiling."

"Hyungbu is the same, what's the big deal."

Despite hearing greetings in turn from Kim Sung-moo, Jang Hee-jin, Kim Tae-hyun and his wife, and Kim Ah-jin and Kim Na-yoon, the couple couldn't stop smiling.

First, Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young bowed to their father-in-law and mother-in-law and received many words of wisdom.

Among them,

"Jeju Island is a great place if it's not inconvenient."

Jang Hee-jin said in a pitying voice while looking at her daughter, but Lee Hyun-woo replied cheerfully.

"I will change all the inconveniences. Don't worry, Mother-in-law."

"Yes, yes. I can trust you."

During dinner, they briefly reported how they spent their time in Hawaii, and when the sisters-in-law said they wanted to see their nieces or nephews soon, Kim Ah-young blushed, and Lee Hyun-woo responded.

"Then the first child will be taken care of by aunt Ah-jin, and the second by aunt Na-yoon ."

"What about Unnie?"

"Unnie is already doing a great job by giving birth."

"What's with that?"

"That's too much. This makes me want to get married quickly. No, there’s someone ahead of me, right?"

That was Kim Ah-jin.

Since she was only three years apart from Kim Ah-young, she should have had a boyfriend by now,

"In the past life, it would have been the case of the family arranged her marriage."

Although Kim Ah-young didn't marry into an ordinary family, Lee Hyun-woo knew that Kim Ah-jin married into a media family.

Surprisingly, during tea time, they heard that she was seeing an ordinary man.

Of course, this was revealed when Kim Na-yoon couldn't keep it to herself while the elders and Kim Tae-hyun's couple were away,

"Brother-in-law might know him too."

Kim Na-yoon tried to reveal more.

"Hey, stop it."

"No, I don't want to."

"Who is it?"

The three sisters asked simultaneously, but Kim Na-yoon only answered Kim Ah-young's question.

"It's Hwan oppa."

"Hwan oppa...? Ah, Lee Hwan, the designer?"

"Yes, that's right."

"How did you meet him again?"

"I introduced them."

"Haha..."

Kim Na-yoon revealed everything, and Kim Ah-jin shook her head in defeat.

Lee Hyun-woo, curious, wanted to ask more about the process, but he had to leave when Kim Sung-moo called him.

Seeing that he was called alone to the study, it was clear they were going to talk business.

"Now that I am officially a son-in-law, he will speak more comfortably."

As he predicted. In the study, Kim Sung-moo asked about Lee Hyun-woo's future plans and discussed matching business ideas, creating an endless conversation.

"Honey, you worked hard."

He was held up until bedtime and could end the day with Kim Ah-young's comforting words.

* * *

The next day, they went to Lee Hyun-woo's family home as planned.

The atmosphere was entirely different.

"Since both of you work, I'll send side dishes often. Okay?"

Mostly, it was about housekeeping.

Although Lee Hyun-woo had become wealthy, his mother, Cho Young-sook, managed the household alone without hiring help.

As the house became bigger, the mother’s work increased.

He thought if he left the house, her work would reduce, but now she said she would send side dishes too.

"It's okay, Mom."

"Okay? Are you hiring someone?"

"Not yet. The house is big, so it would be hard for her to do everything alone. The driver and bodyguard also have to work there..."

"I'll try to manage the household alone, Mother."

At that moment, Kim Ah-young interrupted Lee Hyun-woo.

He was surprised. She said she would do it alone.

"Really?"

He wanted to ask inwardly. Frankly, he found it hard to believe in Kim Ah-young.

Managing a household requires experience and time.

"I’m moving to Jeju Island from Seoul, so I’ve cleared my schedule for about a month."

In other words, she intended to get used to household chores during that period. She continued,

"Mother’s side dishes are delicious, so please send only the leftovers. Don't make extra."

"Is that... so? But, can you really manage alone? The house is very big."

"But I am young. I can handle it. Don't worry."

"Well, okay."

Cho Young-sook originally thought it was natural for a chaebol's daughter to hire help for housekeeping.

But contrary to expectations, Kim Ah-young decided to manage the household herself, which was admirable yet worrisome.

"Can she really do it?"

Before going to bed, she asked her husband, Lee Jung-yong.

"Can she really manage the household when she probably never even got a drop of water on her hands?"

"That's a prejudice. She always did the dishes when she came to our house."

"Really?"

"She probably would have cooked well too if we had asked her. We didn’t, so she didn't."

"Well, that's a relief then."

"And now it’s their business. Times have changed, so don't try to impose old-fashioned in-law expectations."

"How can you think I would make a chaebol’s daughter suffer? What would people say?"

"I mean, don't worry. Times have changed."

"Then what about me living in this era?"

"That's why I said it's okay to hire a housekeeper. You refused."

"Of course, I can't leave my household to someone else."

"Then it’s settled. The daughter-in-law must be similar to you."

Even though he knew it wasn't true, Lee Jung-yong preemptively blocked his wife from meddling in their son and daughter-in-law's life.

He also worried the next day.

* * *

Kim Ah-young indeed planned to cook for her husband with her own hands.

Although they might hire help someday, she wanted to try her best and had learned various things from the housekeeper at her family home. To prove it, she woke up early and made rice and soup.

Cho Young-sook, hearing the noise, woke up and came to the kitchen.

"What are you doing?"

"I made some rice. I'm making soup now."

"How do you know where everything is?"

"I watched while doing the dishes. I used pumpkin and tofu from the fridge with soybean paste base for the soup."

"Oh..."

"Mother, please go back. I saw you made a lot of side dishes, so we don't need to make more. It would be a waste."

"That... that's true, but..."

Eventually, driven by her daughter-in-law's persistence, Cho Young-sook returned to bed but later joined the table when everything was ready. Her husband awkwardly smiled after the first bite.

Wondering why, Cho Young-sook also tasted the rice.

'It's undercooked.'

There was not enough water.

Unaware, Lee Hyun-woo, Lee Jung-woo, and Kim Ah-young continued to eat.

Her two sons momentarily showed a wrong expression but chewed and swallowed nonchalantly.

"Uh?"

Kim Ah-young exclaimed in surprise.

"The rice..."

"I don't like mushy rice."

"Me neither."

"Me too..."

"Yes, our family prefers firm rice."

It was too dry to be called firm rice. Dry rice might have been more accurate.

Not wanting to hurt her daughter-in-law’s feelings, Cho Young-sook quickly covered it up.

"And our rice cooker needs replacing. It’s not working well."

"That's right! Mom tried to fix it instead of buying a new one."

"Yes, I will buy you a new one."

"Haha..."

Lee Hyun-woo laughed awkwardly, and Kim Ah-young felt embarrassed.

* * *

After various mishaps, the couple arrived in Jeju Island.

Feeling less confident, Kim Ah-young asked Lee Hyun-woo at their new home,

"Can I do well?"

"That's the wrong question."

"Then..."

"No, don't ask at all. We should do it together, right?"

At Lee Hyun-woo's kind words, Kim Ah-young's expression brightened.

"Okay. Then I'll definitely succeed with dinner tonight!"

Lee Hyun-woo, seeing her determination, shook his head again.

"Why?"

"We said we'd do it together. You made breakfast, we ate out for lunch, so I'll cook dinner."

"Really?"

"Anything you want?"

"Will you make anything?"

"Of course."

"Then... spaghetti?"

"......"

Not expecting that, Lee Hyun-woo was momentarily speechless.

Luckily, Kim Ah-young read his expression and quickly changed the menu.

"We probably don't have spaghetti ingredients. Since we’re hungry. Ramen!"

"That's my specialty. Hahaha."

Responding, Lee Hyun-woo thought,

"Being a stay-at-home husband is my dream. I should start cooking more often."

To do so, he realized he needed to gather various cooking ingredients. He didn’t even know where to get spaghetti ingredients in Jeju Island.

"I should visit the market and find nearby supermarkets."

Living in Jeju Island wouldn't be easy.

Married life wouldn't be easy either.

Especially when he saw Kim Ah-young putting their honeymoon clothes into the washing machine the next day, he was shocked.

"Shouldn't that be dry cleaned?"

It seemed like there would be many trial and error moments ahead.
