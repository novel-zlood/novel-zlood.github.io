After talking more with Woo Sang-won and Jang Yoo-cheol in an excited state, Lee Hyun-woo returned home.

"But this is getting busier and busier."

He started to feel some regret.

Initially, it wasn't that Lee Hyun-woo didn't push for SNS or cloud services out of ignorance.

Of course, the ecosystem of the internet and technology had to be integrated, but he believed it was achievable once the direction was set.

After all, the CEO of a platform company was more of a top manager than the best developer.

Especially if they had both creativity and imagination, they could push through anything.

However, the reason he didn’t rush was because he thought overlapping tasks would increase the employees' workload.

“Well, it’s not like I suggested it.”

He tried to justify himself.

With four developers competing to create something, he couldn’t help but go along.

"Still, wouldn't it be better to control the pace a bit?"

He wondered if he was turning all of them into workaholics.

That could be.

Although he emphasized work-life balance with his words, his subordinates might feel pressured to deliver results.

Even Yoo Jin-young, who was temporarily serving as a secretary earlier, mentioned that she was attending English conversation classes.

"Huh? This isn’t what I intended. I need to emphasize strict clock-in and clock-out times starting tomorrow."

However, a few days later, what was the reason he found himself at a pub with Woo Sang-won, Jang Yoo-cheol, Oh Min-woo, and Lee Jung-woo when they returned to the country?

* * *

Somehow, Lee Hyun-woo found himself at the center of a business discussion at the pub again.

"Adding design to the blog and streaming music? That's a brilliant idea."

"Right? Right?"

"So Yoo-cheol wasn't just idling around."

"Hey, do you think he did it? Team Leader Woo must have done it all."

"No, actually, Team Leader Jang came up with all the ideas."

"Team Leader Woo, please don’t cover for him too much. Yoo-cheol won't grow that way."

"Ah, you guys! Did you eat something weird in America?"

Watching the noisy conversation among the four, Lee Hyun-woo almost gave up.

"At least getting these four to embrace work-life balance seems impossible."

They seemed to love their work too much.

Even though they came to drink, they kept talking business instead of sharing stress-relieving daily stories.

"By the way, how about you two? Did the collaboration with 【Al Ta Beast】 go well?"

"Of course. In fact, what's there in collaboration? It's just about sharing each other's weapons, right?"

Listening to Woo Sang-won's conversation, Lee Hyun-woo nodded.

No matter how much IT companies valued openness, there were still places that didn't want their search engines to invade their data.

In the past, 【Navy】 also blocked 【Single】's search engine from scraping their knowledge service.

"Wow, if 【Al Ta Beast】 opens up everything, both of us could build the world's largest sea of information."

"Absolutely. 【Al Ta Beast】's database is undoubtedly the largest in the world."

"Looking at this, CEO Lee's decision to send the email first was a masterstroke."

Finally, the conversation turned towards Lee Hyun-woo.

As the attention focused on him, he took a sip of beer, wetting his throat before speaking.

"I’m not sure about that, but they say 【Al Ta Beast】 has revealed more than 20 million web documents. We're sharing some of it now, and once the sharing is complete, 【Jungle USA】 will be born in America."

"Cheers to that!"

"Cheers!"

"Cheers!"

Whatever, it had turned into 'Jung-phoria' beyond patriotism, and Lee Hyun-woo couldn't help but enjoy it with them.

It was quite a coincidence.

Somehow, he sent an email to 【Al Ta Beast】, and they happened to have the largest database.

And as 【Jungle】 proved superior in the ability to find web documents, i.e., in search engine technology, the conditions for collaboration perfectly matched.

"At this rate, we might become a company that combines 【Single】 + 【Face Note】 + 【Amazones】."

It wasn’t intentional.

It was just heading in that direction by chance.

* * *

The next day.

Watching the developers who showed no sign of leaving work, Lee Hyun-woo pondered for a long time.

"Should I leave or stay?"

They had teamed up the previous day to work on a blog upgrade together.

He didn’t want to dampen their enthusiasm by stopping them, so he left them alone.

Although Lee Hyun-woo used to leave work without concern,

"Now I feel self-conscious."

It felt like the roles had reversed.

He wasn’t sure if this was normal and stood there blankly for a while.

If Kim Ah-young hadn’t called, he would have continued drifting in the flow of consciousness.

(Are you hungry? I'm bringing sushi over.)

"Okay, sounds delicious."

Lee Hyun-woo answered reflexively.

Lately, she had been consistently contacting him to share an evening together.

Lee Hyun-woo felt that this might lead to a relationship,

"How can I turn away someone so kind?"

Just answering her calls disarmed his heart.

It seemed to have started when all the team leaders in the development department went overseas.

With the absence of four mid-level managers in the company, Lee Hyun-woo had to stay late, and her visits naturally led to this point.

"Here we are by chance. Well, let's just go with the flow."

While waiting for her to arrive, he looked deeper into his heart.

Honestly, he confirmed that he was starting to develop feelings for Kim Ah-young.

If it wasn’t for her burdensome background with 【Guseong Group】, he would have already asked her out.

So for now, he was just going with the flow, and when she arrived, he greeted her with a big smile.

It was the same when he put the sushi she brought into his mouth.

"Wow, this is delicious."

It tasted so good that his mouth opened naturally.

"Delicious, right? I asked someone who makes it really well at our hotel to make it."

"How can I keep burdening you like this?"

"Well... next time, you can buy something even more delicious."

"I should. But the only places I know are those bars in Jongno we went to last time."

"That’s fine."

Actually, it mattered to Lee Hyun-woo.

That bar was a place he often went with his wife in a past life.

Whether it was her or Kim Ah-young, he felt like he was doing something wrong to both.

"What a weird guy I am."

After mentally cursing himself for applying strange logic, Lee Hyun-woo made a different suggestion to Kim Ah-young.

"Rather than that, next time I should buy you something delicious overseas."

"Overseas? Really?"

"Yeah, honestly, I have a lot of places to go now. Japan, America, Germany, and Taiwan, Hong Kong."

"Weren’t you supposed to go to Japan for a portal site next month, and it seemed like you were preparing for America too, but what’s with Germany all of a sudden? Did the team leaders' work go well?"

"Yeah, it seems to have gone well. We reached an agreement on MP3-related patent usage. And yesterday, 【Deutsche Telekom】 contacted us. They want to service 【Jungle Music】 in Germany."

"Wow..."

Kim Ah-young opened her mouth in amazement.

The growth speed of 【Jungle】 was already out of this world.

The companies they were connected with were already enormous.

【Software Bank】, 【Al Ta Beast】, and now even 【Deutsche Telekom】.

She couldn’t get a grip, and Lee Hyun-woo waited for her answer.

"So, how about going overseas together and enjoying some delicious food?"

"For me, that’d be great."

Kim Ah-young smiled bashfully.

"Oh, right. I plan to visit 【Alpha Cast】 tomorrow."

"Huh?"

"To finalize the investment and sign the contract. The MP3 player is about to be released, right?"

This time, it was Lee Hyun-woo who let out an exclamation.

"Wow... she sure knows how to invest."

And he thought to himself again.

"I can repay her in another way. I can subtly tip her off on where to succeed."

The MP3 player business had a bright future ahead.

With a small investment, it would bring enormous profits, repaying the kindness Kim Ah-young had shown him.

* * *

The next day, around quitting time, Jung Sung-woo, the CEO of 【Alpha Cast】, visited Lee Hyun-woo.

After catching up, Jung Sung-woo suddenly expressed his gratitude.

"Thank you for introducing me to Director Kim Ah-young from 【Seorabol Hotel】."

Lee Hyun-woo responded with a smile.

Jung Sung-woo continued.

"Thanks to Director Kim's significant investment decision, we can greatly increase production this year."

"That's really good news."

"As I always say, it’s quite worrisome. Even though 【Jungle Music】 is doing well and new types of music files are penetrating the market, we have to set the price high."

"So, the price is set?"

"Yes, we decided on 300,000 won in a recent meeting."

Jung Sung-woo glanced at Lee Hyun-woo, curious about his reaction to the higher-than-expected price.

Naturally, Lee Hyun-woo showed a relaxed demeanor and nodded.

"That's the price we discussed."

"Yes, that's right."

They had discussed the price quite a bit in several meetings.

In recent years, with rising wages and inflation, Lee Hyun-woo believed that although 300,000 won was expensive, it would still be competitive.

"I hope you sell a lot and start exporting soon."

"Director Kim also hinted at that."

"Oh? Really?"

"She said it would work well in the U.S. and Japan. However, she thinks 300,000 won is a bit high."

"That’s understandable, especially because of the exchange rate."

Currently, the Korean won was about 850 won to the dollar.

Even this had risen since last year due to the U.S. strong dollar policy.

"The exchange rate will likely rise further. In other words, it will be advantageous for exports."

"That would be great, but..."

For export companies, a super-strong won was tough.

Though not wishing for a financial crisis, Lee Hyun-woo thought the won-dollar exchange rate needed to be more realistic.

"Well, that might not be too far off."

Currently, the ongoing inquiry into 【Bohan Group】 was bringing out financial and political figures one after another.

This situation was being broadcasted to investors, causing the composite stock price index to fall and the exchange rate to steadily rise.

"If it rises appropriately, exports will do well."

It was fascinating.

Not long ago, Lee Hyun-woo had been worried about a financial crisis, but now he was thinking about an appropriate level for the exchange rate.

There was a reason.

【Misam Group】 was holding out longer than expected.

In his past life, news of their bankruptcy should have already come.

Was this also a butterfly effect caused by Lee Hyun-woo’s emergence?
