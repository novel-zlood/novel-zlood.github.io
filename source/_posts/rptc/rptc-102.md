Curious about Lee Hyun-woo, Kim Sung-moo kept hearing his son's voice in his ears.

"Ah, CEO Lee said the person he respects the most is his father."

Did that young man really say something like that?

Since it didn't feel unpleasant, Kim Sung-moo let out an awkward cough.

"Ahem, ahem."

"And when I mentioned my father's sense of crisis, he said that his foresight was indeed remarkable."

Embarrassed.

Kim Sung-moo quickly changed the direction of the conversation.

"What kind of person is he?"

"His character is good. He's not frivolous in his words and actions, but he's not always quiet either. He clearly expresses his opinions. Father, you'll like him when you meet him."

"Since we're talking about it, I should meet him sometime."

Kim Tae-hyun's eyebrows raised.

He had just thrown it out there, not expecting his father to react so immediately.

"Should I arrange a meeting then?"

"Not now. Since you meet him often, let's observe a little more."

"Yes, Father."

Kim Sung-moo suppressed his desire to meet Lee Hyun-woo.

He thought it would be better to let the younger generation build a rapport first.

For the first time in a while, he smiled warmly in front of his son.

'This kid is finally hanging out with the right kind of people.'

Most of his son's friends were second or third-generation chaebols with a tendency for mischief.

He thought they were all the same, but it felt awkward to interfere in his son's friendships as the head of the 【Guseong Group】.

Then he started to intervene after registering him as a director at the company.

Thinking that assuming he would naturally inherit the company was a misconception.

That if he didn't conduct himself properly and was negligent in company matters, special measures would be taken.

The people he was associating with were so bad that he couldn't help but say it.

'But now he's meeting young talents who can talk about the future and share a sense of crisis.'

Kim Sung-moo couldn't help but feel satisfied.

He felt an unwarranted fondness for Lee Hyun-woo.

* * *

That night, Kim Sung-moo quietly sat at his computer and opened a portal site called 【Jungle】.

ADSL was already installed in this area.

It was the first region in Korea to commercialize it, so there was no problem connecting.

As soon as he opened the site, various data immediately caught his eye.

Among them, the newly changed search rankings naturally drew his attention.

'Hmm, there's more to see every day.'

To run something like this, they must have installed quite a few servers.

Come to think of it, he remembered his son mentioning something recently.

That the server market would be very promising in the future.

That they should hurry and create higher-spec servers.

Kim Sung-moo had told his son to proceed as he saw fit.

'I heard that the demand for the new servers recently released is very high.'

Perhaps his son had predicted the demand for higher-spec servers while building a rapport with Lee Hyun-woo from 【Jungle】?

Indeed, who you associate with can make a big difference, he thought, moving the cursor to the search bar.

He was curious about how much information this portal site could find with just one search term.

The conversation with his son today lingered most in his mind.

― 【Bohan Group】

When he pressed enter, a series of news articles appeared...

'Huh? What's this related search term?'

A few words listed as 'related search terms' caught his eye.

One of them stood out.

'Nostradamus...'

Both his son and his brother-in-law, the owner of 【Sejong Ilbo】, had mentioned the name several times.

Kim Sung-moo himself had once been surprised when he visited Nostradamus's blog out of curiosity.

With just a few keywords, the future was predicted so accurately that it gave him goosebumps.

He personally suspected that Nostradamus might be from the economic research institutes of some groups.

'Should I check what he's written recently?'

But when he entered Nostradamus's blog today, he thought he might have to revise that idea.

― Predictions by Country in 1997

【Japan Edition】

There will be financial reforms to allow large corporations to enter the banking, securities, and insurance sectors.

Specifically, it includes allowing financial holding companies, limiting fiscal deficits to 3% of GDP, and liberalizing foreign exchange transactions... (omitted)...

The reason I address Japan first is very simple.

Last year, while addressing the U.S., I mentioned the crisis brought about by the 'strong dollar.'

As the world becomes more interconnected due to advances in transportation and communication, the impact between countries increases daily. The 'strong dollar' has finally brought a crisis to our country.

One example could be groups like 【Bohan】.

These groups have increased the probability of triggering a financial or currency crisis by using short-term foreign debt.

By addressing Japan now, we can anticipate how a financial or currency crisis might unfold.

…(omitted)…

Nostradamus seemed to try to explain it in simple terms, but not many people would fully understand this content.

However, Kim Sung-moo understood it effortlessly.

Because he already knew that the Japanese government would reform its financial sector.

'But the opposition is so strong that it will be hard to implement.'

While he wasn't sure about other aspects, if they liberalize foreign exchange transactions or limit fiscal deficits to 3% of GDP, it would bring a significant backlash to many developing countries in Asia, including Korea.

As more people try to buy Japanese yen, the currencies of various countries would depreciate.

Since the U.S. had already declared a strong dollar policy, this phenomenon would only intensify.

'No way, is this really going to happen?'

Kim Sung-moo thought that this time, Nostradamus might have gotten it wrong.

After all, if someone could continuously predict what even economists couldn't, they would be a god, not a person.

But then it actually happened.

A few days later, information reached Kim Sung-moo that the Japanese government had started discussing five major financial reform tasks.

As soon as he received this information, he immediately contacted his son.

"You need to schedule some time with the CEO of 【Jungle】 soon."

* * *

Lee Hyun-woo intended to actively use Nostradamus's blog to capture the premonition of the impending foreign exchange crisis.

Recently, he had posted about Japan, and today he posted about Germany from the CEO's office.

It was about the privatization of 【Deutsche Telekom】.

'Sometimes it's important to throw out opportunities in times of crisis.'

He felt it was necessary to inform the public that the global information and communication industry was rapidly changing.

Of course, he wasn't sure how interested people would be, but fundamentally, a massive number of people visited Nostradamus's blog.

Even now, as soon as he posted it, the view count was rapidly increasing.

He would have continued to monitor it if the phone hadn't rung.

"Hello."

(Hey, it's me.)

"Oh? Hyung?"

(You need to make some time soon.)

"Why? Do you want to see me?"

(Of course, I'm totally into you. But our father wants to set up a meeting with you.)

"……!"

Exclamation marks appeared in Lee Hyun-woo's eyes.

The bait was meant for the heir, but it was taken from a higher place.

Of course, he thought they would meet someday, but he didn't expect it to be so soon.

'Does the head of 【Guseong Group】 also read Nostradamus's blog?'

It was possible.

Most heads of chaebol groups try to stay ahead of the times.

Especially the head of 【Guseong Group】, who would naturally be confident in the brilliant growth of the information and communication industry and would likely check out internet-based content like portal sites to not fall behind.

If that's the case?

"Why does he want to meet me?"

(Why? You don't want to?)

"It's not that, I just think I need to prepare. I respect him, so what if I make a mistake?"

(I actually suggested it.)

"Hyung did?"

(Yeah, it just felt like dad needed to meet you.)

It was clear that he had relayed the conversation they had last time.

Thinking this, Lee Hyun-woo quickly responded.

"Alright. How about tomorrow evening?"

(Okay, I'll let him know.)

Shortly after, as he was about to leave work, Kim Tae-hyun called again and told him to come to their house the next evening.

The house, of course, referred to the residence of the head of 【Guseong Group】.

* * *

This news soon reached Park Min-sook, who naturally reported it to Kim Ah-young.

"The chairman must have noticed something. Otherwise, there's no reason for him to invite CEO Lee directly to the house."

Listening to Park Min-sook's somewhat flustered voice, Kim Ah-young was also at a loss.

Noticed something?

Did that mean he had found out about her excessive fondness for Lee Hyun-woo?

"But we aren't anything yet."

"Maybe that's why he's calling CEO Lee to warn him. To handle it strictly as business even if you're interested. Or maybe to tell him not to meet anymore."

"Then... what should we do?"

"There's no immediate solution. We can't explain the situation to CEO Lee. Or should we subtly inform him?"

"How do we inform him?"

"Tell him not to misunderstand if the chairman makes assumptions..."

Even while advising, it felt wrong.

The current situation, where the chairman was inviting Lee Hyun-woo to the house, was mentally overwhelming both of them.

No clear countermeasure was in sight.

In the end, all they could do was watch the meeting between Kim Sung-moo and Lee Hyun-woo the next day.

Perhaps because of this, Kim Ah-young stayed up all night.

She wanted to call Lee Hyun-woo several times but held back.

What could she say in this situation where they weren't even in a relationship?

Finally, the next morning arrived.

As usual, she sat at the dining table with her two younger sisters for breakfast, and her father's gentle voice accompanied by a kind expression flowed out.

"Kids, we have a guest coming tonight, so you all can come home early, right?"

"A guest? Who is it?"

Asked the second daughter, Kim Ah-jin.

She was three years younger than Kim Ah-young.

To this question, Kim Sung-moo smiled again and answered.

"Ah-young knows him well. It's Lee Hyun-woo, the CEO of 【Jungle】. You said you were investing in their entry into Japan."

"Oh, yes..."

"What? Lee Hyun-woo from 【Jungle】? Really? Really, Dad?"

The youngest, Kim Na-yoon, who was very charming, widened her eyes in curiosity.

"Yes, he's a very promising young man. He's very close to your brother, too. I want to introduce him to you, so don't think about skipping out. Got it?"

At that moment, Kim Ah-young blinked a few times and thought.

'So he didn't find out. But Dad thinks highly of Hyun-woo.'

She felt inexplicably happy.
