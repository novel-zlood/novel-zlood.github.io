"If you're thinking of lowering yours compared to Jungle's search engine, I'd like to tell you that's a mistake."

Steven Job's words implied that the "Give and Take" search engine was competitive enough.

If he only offered praise and encouragement, it would be hard for Mikhail Face and Ray Burin to be convinced.

So, Steven Job began a lengthy explanation.

"There are plenty of reasons. First, the starting points of Jungle and Give and Take are different. The former started with online shopping before becoming a portal site, undergoing numerous trials and errors. It has been refined and upgraded to become nearly complete. But what about yours? It was used on a P2P site. The number of users is far smaller than on a portal site. Even if there were trials and errors, the frequency and sample size for improvements would be limited. Moreover, it hasn't been long since it was integrated into a P2P site."

"......"

"......"

"Thus, while Jungle's search engine is nearly complete, I can say that yours is still immature but has tremendous potential."

The precise point made by Steven Job changed the look in their eyes.

Mikhail Face and Ray Burin were no fools. In fact, they had often been called geniuses throughout their lives.

But when they encountered Jungle's search engine, which came out before what they had envisioned, their arrogance was slightly humbled by seeing Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo, who created it.

As time passed, Jungle was revolutionizing the world of information technology.

Naturally, they also wanted to change the world in a different way, admiring them.

"The concept of P2P is very good, but there are limits to pursuing commercial interests. You know that too. Above all, your search engine needs to be upgraded as it's used on a portal site. Isn't that right?"

They didn't answer, but their eyes showed a significant agreement.

They were momentarily absorbed by Steven Job's enthusiasm.

Naturally, their hearts were also burning with passion.

"Let's do this. Billy and I are developing a new search engine. We'll include you in this. Then the three of us will develop a new search engine together to surpass Jungle..."

"......"

"......"

"Don't you want to join hands?"

Nod, nod.

Nod, nod.

Like magnets being attracted, the two automatically nodded their heads.

A delightful voice flowed from Steven's mouth.

"Good, that's great. Hahaha."

* * *

Steven Job couldn't hide his joy.

Although they were one step behind Jungle, the addition of the two felt like a thousand reinforcements.

On the way back, Steven Job was beaming in the car.

Jordan Live asked,

"Are you that happy?"

"Of course. Just working together is great, and I can show them the strengths of me and Pineapple. Someday, they'll work with us."

"Absorb them naturally?"

"Yes, I want to embrace them somehow."

"That will probably happen. If you treat them as you treated me."

"Like I treated you?"

"Yes, you were always sincere. And you made it seem like Pineapple wouldn't work without me."

"That's true."

"They'll feel the same. Today, you made them think they were equal to Macro Soft and Pineapple, so their eyes were full of affection for you."

It might have been flattery, but Steven Job felt very good.

"By the way, Billy Gates has to accept it."

"If he doesn't like it, there's nothing we can do."

"Nothing we can do? Does that mean you'll work with Give and Take alone, abandoning Macro Soft?"

"Yes."

"Huh? That's unexpected."

"Really? I'd rather Billy doesn't accept Give and Take."

"Why?"

"To close the gap with Macro Soft."

"Ah..."

Jordan Live immediately understood Steven Job's intention.

What would happen if a search engine developed by three companies was used on the portal sites of Pineapple and Macro Soft?

Naturally, there would be no technological gap.

Then, Macro Soft, the top in the information technology industry, could use its status and capital to increase its market share, making it impossible to close the gap or catch up.

Was it because of this?

When Steven Job returned to the company, he made a half-hearted call to Billy Gates, discussing it in a desultory manner.

But Billy Gates immediately gave an 'okay' sign.

He, too, knew Give and Take's P2P site well and highly evaluated the company's search engine technology.

"Damn, that sly fox."

"Haha..."

Jordan Live awkwardly smiled at Steven Job, who cursed after hanging up the phone.

Then he said,

"It seems Billy Gates fully understood Steven's intention."

"That too, and he wants to catch up with Jungle quickly."

"That makes Hyun-woo Lee seem even more impressive than Billy Gates?"

"Indeed. Our three companies have united to bring him down."

But there was something Steven Job didn't know.

In fact, the leaders of the three groups, who made their names in the previous life, were united to bring down Jungle.

Lee Hyun-woo's return was creating a tremendous butterfly effect.

He might be enjoying the current situation, though.

* * *

Meanwhile, at Jungle, they were also monitoring 'Ocean,' which had appeared in the United States.

Especially, Woo Sang-won, the head of operations, had been continuously monitoring it since its launch, identifying its strengths and weaknesses.

After lunch, he went to consult Lee Hyun-woo.

"The search engine and content are not comparable to ours."

"Is that so?"

"Yes, we must not be complacent, but for now, Jungle's search engine is superior."

Lee Hyun-woo nodded, showing that Woo Sang-won had pointed it out accurately.

"That's exactly right. We must not be complacent. Because it's Steven Job."

"Yes..."

Woo Sang-won replied with a curious expression.

Not because Lee Hyun-woo acknowledged Steven Job,

"But CEO, why are you smiling?"

Because Lee Hyun-woo, who seemed to be enjoying himself, was smiling brightly.

"Am I?"

"Yes. You're always smiling, but today's smile is different."

"How is it different?"

"I'm not sure..."

"Perhaps the smile of an athlete before an exciting match?"

"Oh? That's right."

When the answer popped out of Lee Hyun-woo's mouth, Woo Sang-won immediately nodded.

"It's actually become interesting."

"The current portal site war, you mean?"

Nod, nod.

Developers and operators had to be on edge, but Lee Hyun-woo found it truly exciting.

He had been worried about being bored until retirement recently, but now Billy Gates was keeping him in check, and Steven Job was pushing hard.

How could this not be fun?

'For it to be more interesting, the balance of the competition must be maintained.'

For now, Jungle, which had the market lead, was in a favorable position.

But the opponents were no joke.

Macro Soft's capital was incomparable, and Pineapple had Steven Job's keen eye for talent.

In fact, in the previous life, the latter could eventually surpass the former.

Because Steven Job had chosen his successor well.

'Not just the successor. He had excellent developers, designers, managers, and administrators around him.'

Knowing this, Lee Hyun-woo began to outline the strengths of the opponent.

"The reason I said not to be complacent is simple. Steven Job has countless fans worldwide. Especially in the U.S., many people see him as a role model. Like an idol singer."

"An idol..."

"It means an icon. Just as teenagers recently go crazy over teen groups, there are groups that follow Steven Job. Their loyalty is high. That's why Pineapple's computers, which are just high-spec and expensive, sell at a certain level every year."

"Ah... Yes..."

"Moreover, I saw the portal site. While the functionality doesn't match ours, the design is no joke. Right?"

"Yes, I acknowledge that."

"Personally, I think that's something we need to learn from."

Lee Hyun-woo was convinced that the future portal site war would be fought by filling in each other's weaknesses and boldly 'borrowing' the strengths of the opponent.

That's why even Yaho currently uses Jungle's search engine.

'Then Pineapple won't stand still either.'

They would be striving to improve the accuracy of their search engine.

Naturally, Jungle would 'borrow' their strengths.

"This time, we need to recruit designers extensively."

At this point, Woo Sang-won looked at Lee Hyun-woo with curious eyes.

"Recruit a lot of designers?"

"Yes, indeed. Especially in our country, there is a real shortage of designers who can create graphics. So I think it wouldn't be bad to recruit designers, train them, and then deploy them in all of Jungle's content."

"Now that you mention it, I heard Director Lee Jung-woo complaining a while ago. He said it was hard because the characters and backgrounds he envisioned didn't come out well. He wished there were more talented people in this field, but there weren't many."

"Yes, probably."

It was a time when there weren't many excellent designers.

Naturally, there was a severe shortage of designers related to computer graphics.

'That's why the characters and backgrounds in the game he was developing were somewhat shabby.'

Therefore, securing graphic designers and illustrators was expected to become increasingly important.

Knowing this, Lee Hyun-woo continued his explanation.

"On the other hand, Steven Job probably has a lot of designers in computer graphics. As you know, he is the CEO of the animation production company Pix."

Lee Hyun-woo's words were true.

Pix, led by Steven Job, had already achieved great success with the movie 'Toy Story.'

"Oh, right. I momentarily forgot that Steven Job is the CEO of an animation production company."

"It was ironic. Originally, Steven intended to use the movie company to promote computer hardware and software."

"Really? I didn't know that."

"Yes, he created something called Image Computer. It's a computer for professionals and is very expensive. It costs over 100 million won in our country's money. Naturally, the demand was limited. The main customers were mostly animation production companies and designers. As a result, he couldn't recoup the investment and costs, and later, while taking on commissioned work for Dezen... In a state of 'whatever!' he produced an animated movie that was a huge hit last year. In the process, the graphic designers and illustrators he secured became Steven's network and asset."
