In a previous life, the reason 【Yaho】 failed was because it couldn't differentiate its search function, losing its position as the emperor of portals to 【Single】.

Conversely, if you want to maintain a preoccupied position, you just have to keep doing what you do well.

Since the most important function of a portal site is search, Lee Hyun-woo extended a favor in his own way.

However, the moment he suggested using 【Jungle】's search engine, he realized that a cold air lingered around him.

This atmosphere emanated from Jamie Yang's expression.

'His pride is hurt.'

Lee Hyun-woo thought Jamie Yang still had a long way to go as a manager.

'How can he not control his facial expressions this much?'

If he didn't like it, he could simply laugh it off lightly.

Yet, he hardened his expression and finally spoke the following words.

"Personally, I believe our company's search engine is the best."

"Of course. 【Yaho】's search engine is top-notch."

Lee Hyun-woo responded with a subtle tone.

'Why can I read young people's expressions so well?'

He wouldn't be unaware of the answer.

The experience accumulated over more than 50 years of his previous life allowed him to read the expressions of the young people he met in this one.

Jamie Yang was twenty-nine years old, which could be considered thirty in Korean age.

Compared to Lee Hyun-woo's mental age, he was no different from a baby.

So clear, almost transparent.

"I know that in Taiwan, you have a much greater advantage than we do. Language is very important for search engines. Since you're from Taiwan and the young developers here prefer 【Yaho】, you naturally have an advantage over us."

"You're being humble."

"I mean it."

"Then I should say you're being honest."

"Ah, that's my greatest strength. So I have another suggestion: how about 【Jungle】 and 【Yaho】 join forces to enhance Taiwan's internet ecosystem and ADSL infrastructure?"

Jamie Yang postponed the conversation.

Realizing that he had been losing control to Lee Hyun-woo, he quickly sensed the need to change the atmosphere.

But did Lee Hyun-woo read this from his expression too?

"Ah, I'm sorry. I made another presumptuous suggestion."

"No, I had the same thought."

"As expected..."

"......"

"I heard that you were ranked first among the 50 people who influenced global IT by 【Forbes & Fortune】 in the United States. It turns out to be true."

"Haha..."

Having been so good at flattering and coaxing, it was hard for him to regain his composure today.

Receiving a compliment, he felt he had to return it, so he said,

"If you were in the United States, I think that position would have been yours, Mr. 'Lee.'"

"Personally, I don't think I qualify. I just borrowed what was already there."

"Again, you're being humble."

"I repeat, I mean it."

Lee Hyun-woo's intention was that he was applying what he had experienced in his previous life to this one early on.

Naturally, Jamie Yang couldn't understand his intention.

'If I hadn't turned back my life, you would have been leading 【Yaho】 to its prime now.'

Jamie Yang once gave an interview in Korea.

He said he was a very lucky person.

In Japan, he met Son Jung-yi and achieved great success with 【Yaho Japan】, and in China, he coincidentally met Ma Won and invested in 【Alababa】.

For reference, even though 【Yaho】 later went into decline, the $1 billion invested in 【Alababa】 in 2004 returned $30 billion, making Jamie Yang a director of 【Alababa】.

So he could only describe himself as lucky.

Now, it seemed that Lee Hyun-woo, reincarnated in this life, was taking away Jamie Yang's luck.

Even the conversation they had here was showing signs of spreading rapidly.

When asked by reporters as he walked out,

"Could you tell us what you talked about?"

Lee Hyun-woo hesitated and conveyed the conversation as follows:

"We shared a consensus that we will do our best to improve Taiwan's internet ecosystem and ADSL infrastructure. Given the recent economic downturn, we hope our investment will yield good results."

"Could you be more specific?"

"This is all I can say. Hahaha."

Lee Hyun-woo left a hint for the rest to 'ask Jamie Yang, not me.'

The remaining reporters started chatting.

"Isn't this about 【Yaho】 and 【Jungle】 joining hands to enter the Taiwanese ADSL service?"

"No way?"

"Why not? Both companies grow when internet penetration increases."

"Wow, then can we expect something? Our country's economy is in serious turmoil these days."

"Yeah. I'm also confused about what to write these days. There's so much to write about, but it feels like I'm making people anxious for no reason."

"I knew it. The foreign exchange crisis that started in Thailand couldn't possibly have no impact."

"But our country has a relatively ample foreign exchange reserve, right?"

"Yeah, so even if there's currency depreciation, it's said that we won't collapse like Thailand."

"But you never know what will happen the next day in today's economy. If these two companies invest in Taiwan's information and communication infrastructure?"

"Thinking about it, it wouldn't be bad to write as if they're about to invest."

"Why?"

"You could stimulate those who were planning to enter the ADSL market but postponed it."

"Oh, that's right! Should we steer the article in that direction?"

"Okay, I'll write it that way. Honestly, an economic crisis wouldn't be good for us either."

"Of course. So let's write that 【Jungle】 and 【Yaho】 are considering entering the ADSL service together."

"Yeah, considering means they might not do it later, so it's very appropriate."

Somehow, the scenario continued like this.

Indeed, in Taiwan, the meeting between Lee Hyun-woo and Jamie Yang was a significant one.

* * *

Though not a historic meeting, today's recording of Clones had an interesting encounter.

"CEO Lee Hyun-woo is a huge fan of our Wang Ji-hyun and really wanted to meet her."

As soon as Clones, who were special guests on the talk show, mentioned 【Jungle】 and Lee Hyun-woo, Wang Ji-hyun, who had also come specially today, sparkled her eyes.

"Oh? I'm a fan of CEO Lee Hyun-woo too."

"Wow, really? Then we should arrange a meeting between you two sometime."

"Sure, I'd love that."

At that moment, the talk show host interrupted.

"Does CEO Lee Hyun-woo have someone he's dating?"

"Not that I know of."

"Yeah, I think he's single."

"I heard there was a scandal with Kim Yoon-seon before."

When they looked at Kim Yoon-seon, who had been quiet, she waved her hand and said,

"Oh, we're just friends. There's nothing between us."

"Oh, really?"

"Then since Wang Ji-hyun and Lee Hyun-woo seem to match well, we can look forward to it, right?"

Though it was said out of courtesy, Wang Ji-hyun looked genuinely excited and gave a pretty expression while looking at Clones.

"Right. Can I look forward to it?"

"Instead of just waiting, you should make an effort."

"Right. We can introduce you, but it takes effort from both sides to go further, doesn't it?"

Sensing that the atmosphere was getting awkward, Kim Yoon-seon intervened.

The relationship between Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young was a secret known to only a few.

So she hadn't told the two members of Clones yet, but now they were suggesting introducing Wang Ji-hyun.

'Well, it's just a courtesy.'

But it wasn't just a courtesy.

In the car returning to the dorm, the conversation between Clones revealed genuine intentions for their friend.

"Did you see Hyun-woo's face on the plane?"

"Yeah, he really wanted to meet Wang Ji-hyun."

"Right. He asked us to set up a meeting."

"Hey, could this be an international couple?"

Fearing that Kim Ah-young might be displeased, Kim Yoon-seon quickly intervened.

"He's just meeting a fan. Don't overinterpret it."

"Before being a fan and a star, it's a meeting between a man and a woman."

"Right. It's a significant meeting. The world-renowned CEO of an information and communication company 【Jungle】 and the pure and seductive star Wang Ji-hyun meeting!"

"That's not it."

"Why are you like this? Are you... jealous?"

"Right. Didn't you say there's nothing between you and Hyun-woo?"

"Oh, really. I'm frustrated. Enough!"

Honestly, there was no need to raise her voice like this.

But her emotions were stirred for no reason.

So she tried to cover it up with an excuse she wouldn't normally make.

"We're here to promote with sponsorships from various companies. The broadcasts and concerts are scheduled for promotional purposes. I just said that because it seemed like they were straying from the goal."

"Oh, really?"

"It seems weird, but okay, I'll accept that."

With the two fellow singers teasing her like this, Kim Yoon-seon thought she should stop talking.

As soon as they arrived at the hotel, she greeted them briefly and went up to her room.

At that moment, she happened to meet Choi Sun-hwa in the elevator.

"Oh?"

"Sun-hwa."

They were already friends.

Especially because of Choi Sun-hwa's unpretentious personality, they quickly became close enough to call each other by name.

"Did the broadcast go well?"

"It did, but I think it'll be weird when it airs live."

"Why?"

"Just. The kids keep selling out Hyun-woo."

"Selling out Hyun-woo?"

"Yeah, there's that."

Choi Sun-hwa may be unpretentious, but Kim Yoon-seon wasn't good at hiding her true feelings.

Instead, she was cautious and often didn't reveal the critical part of her story.

In a way, she had met her match.

"You make people curious and then... Let's talk over coffee."

"It's nothing..."

"Coffee won't do. Let's have a beer. You must be tired after a whole day."

Moreover, Choi Sun-hwa was good at pushing.

So, she stood out even among the male executives in the group for her drive.

Reluctantly, Kim Yoon-seon went to Choi Sun-hwa's room, opened a beer, and clinked glasses.

"Being a celebrity, you can't even drink outside."

"Oh, sorry."

"Oh, no need to apologize. You really don't seem like a celebrity. Why are you so transparent?"

"Am I?"

That's why she sometimes got scammed and took on unnecessary burdens.

"Anyway, what's up?"

"......"

"Are you hesitating again? Just tell me, it's fine."

"I just want to ask you one thing."

"Wow, I asked first, though..."

"Sorry."

"Sorry again? Okay, ask away. I'll tell you everything."

"Are Hyun-woo and Ah-young really dating?"

Choi Sun-hwa's pupils slightly shook.

Then she gulped down her beer and replied to Kim Yoon-seon as if she understood something.

"Yeah, they are. But why are you asking? Did you also have feelings for Hyun-woo?"

"......?"

This time, question marks started to form in Kim Yoon-seon's mind.

Also? Does that mean Choi Sun-hwa also had feelings for Lee Hyun-woo?
