Design was the area that Lee Hyun-woo paid the most attention to in this recruitment process.

So when his future sister-in-law, Kim Na-yoon, changed her dream to web design, a smile naturally appeared on his lips.

"Whether it's development or web design, isn't this working with my sister-in-law?"

Lee Hyun-woo was not someone who avoided working with family or blood relatives.

This time, working in sync with his younger brother, he realized that it was always a reliable source of strength and even welcomed it.

Lee Hyun-woo had heard a lot about the pitfalls of family-run businesses in his past life, to the extent that people would say the family would run the company into the ground.

But that was because the company was managed in an unhealthy way.

Currently, under a fair system like that of Lee Hyun-woo, there were no problems if family members were involved.

Of course, the system was not yet perfect.

Although he had solidified the structure with ten departments and two secretariat chiefs, there were still a few missing elements.

Those were the accounting and legal teams.

Therefore, Lee Hyun-woo was engrossed in reorganizing Jungle until the end of November, and as he finished up, he thought about his father's business on his way home early for the first time in a while.

"It's time to pay attention to my father's work."

It wasn't exactly family management, but his father's business was at a turning point.

In fact, since returning to the past, Lee Hyun-woo had set his life goals as being a filial son, a good husband, and a respected father.

No matter how busy he was, he wanted to be a son who paid attention to his parents' affairs, so as soon as he returned home, he brought up the topic to his father, Lee Jung-yong, in a calm voice.

"It's opening soon, right?"

"Ah, yes."

Lee Hyun-woo realized that there was a mix of anxiety in his father's sigh.

"It seems he's worried because the economy isn't good these days."

In fact, the current boom in South Korea was concentrated in the information and communications industry.

Other sectors were struggling, so his father's worries were natural.

Lee Hyun-woo encouraged his father with a smile.

"The opening of GAPE KOREA seems perfect for a recession."

"Really?"

"Yes, in America, they call it a fast fashion brand."

"Right. You explained that to me before."

During their business trip to the U.S. together, Lee Hyun-woo had many conversations with his father.

One of them was about the prospects of fast fashion brands.

"But understanding it when explained and facing it in reality... I'm not sure if it will do well."

"It will do well. Especially since it's not just any brand, but partnering with GAPE is a masterstroke."

A clothing brand that handles planning, production, and distribution all under one company, SPA.

The concept of fast fashion originally came from GAPE.

"Considering that my father lacks experience and know-how in running a clothing brand, GAPE KOREA is a perfect fit."

Of course, Lee Hyun-woo knew this process well.

Reducing intermediate distribution, lessening inventory burden, and speeding up trend reflection.

His past experience of leading the fast fashion brand of Dukseong Group was invaluable and also the driving force behind his ability to check on his father's company while managing Jungle.

This will be the same even after the opening.

Ensuring they follow the latest trends, manage fast product turnover, and keep product prices reasonable.

"Considering the prices, GAPE KOREA was really expensive in my past life."

In this life, that had to change 180 degrees.

And these advantages would drive the rapid growth of his father's company, Two Woo Fashion.

* * *

Two more days passed, and his father, Lee Jung-yong, became more anxious.

Watching him get up after only a few spoonfuls of breakfast, Lee Hyun-woo felt it strongly.

"He's reached the peak of his anxiety."

Well, today was the opening day.

So his mother had prepared a much more elaborate breakfast than usual, and she wore a similarly worried expression.

"Why don't you eat more?"

"I can't. I need to go."

"But the department store isn't open yet..."

"That's only for customers. I can get in."

At that moment, Lee Jung-woo, who was eating with them, also tried to stop their father.

"Father, don't worry too much and finish your meal. There's no way it won't succeed with my brother's help, right, hyung?"

"It's not because I helped, but because it's the perfect timing. This kind of brand will do well in a recession. Father... please finish your meal and then go."

"No, I feel like I need to be there to feel reassured. And I'm sure designer Lee Hwan will be there too. He's even more worried than I am."

"Sigh, then I'll take you there."

"It's okay, it's okay. How can you not finish your meal because of me? Don't worry about me, finish your meal and come by later... like around lunchtime. Or you don't even have to come."

People usually don't want to show their insecurities when they lack confidence in their work.

It seemed to be that kind of moment.

Given the current situation in South Korea, the economy was deteriorating day by day.

Recently, there had even been talks about the IMF.

There were comments that, like Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries, South Korea would have to apply for a bailout to overcome the current economic crisis.

Of course, there was considerable opposition to this.

Countries like Taiwan and Malaysia, which did not apply for a bailout, were cited, suggesting that South Korea, with its similar or stronger economic foundation, did not need to apply for a bailout.

Anyway, the factors causing his father's anxiety were present.

"I hope it's a big hit from the first day."

Lee Hyun-woo wished for a booming opening day to see his father's worried face only today.

His younger brother, Lee Jung-woo, felt the same.

After their father left, he said to his brother,

"I hope today marks the highest sales in the history of the department store."

"It's not that simple. Fast fashion brands don't sell expensive items, so achieving that level is tough. Instead, I hope it sells out quickly."

"When are you planning to go?"

"I'm thinking of going in time for the opening. What about you?"

"I'll go right after school."

"Oh, you're working hard."

Lee Jung-woo was living independently.

But since today marked the start of their father's new turning point in life, he came home last night.

Balancing school, game development, and family affairs, Lee Hyun-woo couldn't help but be proud of his younger brother.

On the other hand, Lee Jung-woo complained for no reason.

"It's all because of you, hyung. I always think about dropping out of school. But you insist I must graduate..."

At that moment, their mother slammed her spoon down.

Lee Jung-woo flinched.

"I'm joking, Mom. Haha... why are you taking it so seriously?"

"It doesn't sound like a joke."

"No, it's really a joke. I've been stressed lately because I'm about to release a game. That's why I said nonsense. I'll graduate, I'll graduate. Haha..."

Lee Jung-woo, who lowered his tail, began shoveling food into his mouth.

* * *

Meanwhile, Lee Jung-yong's business was also the top priority for Kim Ah-young.

That's why she talked about it with Park Min-sook on her way to work.

"What time is the opening again?"

"10:30 AM. You're asking for the second time today."

"I've only asked twice."

"Should I tell you the combined number for this week?"

"Forget it. Should we just leave now?"

"Director, it's not even 8 AM yet. The store isn't open."

"I'm afraid of traffic..."

"Now is the time when traffic is bad, and it will be less congested then."

"Okay..."

"I won't say anything about you being concerned, but you seem too hasty."

"It's not that, it's just that I heard department store sales have been declining recently."

"That's because the economy is bad these days. Except for electronics and information technology, everything else is sluggish, so department stores can't help it. Some have already gone bankrupt."

"So people might not come to the department store much, and it's opening at this time... it feels a bit off."

"Why do you care?"

"I feel like I urged him."

Originally, Lee Jung-yong ran a dyeing factory.

Then, with some determination, Kim Ah-young started supporting him actively, which gave him the courage to venture into Two Woo Fashion.

Initially, it went very well.

Cheap clothing products sold well at Jungle Shopping, and it was largely thanks to Kim Na-yoon, Kim Ah-young's younger sister.

She used her blog for free advertising.

This time, Kim Na-yoon was also helping with the opening of GAPE KOREA.

- I really like Hyun-woo oppa. He even gave me sticky rice cakes and taffy for the university entrance exam. Maybe that's why I did well.

Indeed, Lee Hyun-woo had stopped by in the morning to give Kim Na-yoon sticky rice cakes and taffy for her recent university entrance exam.

Since he even took care of her sister, it was natural for Kim Ah-young to care about Lee Jung-yong's business.

That's why she was so anxious, but Park Min-sook clicked her tongue and shook her head.

"Didn't you say Mr. Lee's dream was to run a clothing company? And how much attention would Mr. Lee have paid? It's his father's company, after all. It will go well, so don't worry too much."

But it seemed Kim Ah-young didn't hear that, as she quickly took out her phone and called someone.

"Aunt? Yes, it's me. Ah, today's the opening of Mr. Hyun-woo's father's store... Ah, you're paying attention? Yes, yes, I got it. I'll see you later then."

"Sigh..."

Seeing Kim Ah-young fidgeting, Park Min-sook sighed.

"She's really fired up."

These days, it seemed all of Kim Ah-young's conversations revolved around Lee Hyun-woo.

* * *

After arriving at work, Lee Hyun-woo received a brief morning report from Woo Sang-won and the two secretaries.

Then, he headed to New World Department Store to coincide with the 10:30 AM opening.

Due to some traffic, he couldn't arrive exactly on time.

So he got off at the lobby instead of the parking lot and quickly took the elevator up.

He hoped silently as he went up.

"I hope it goes well."

Although he knew it couldn't be perfect from the start, as a son, he wished for his father's business to flourish.

When he arrived, he saw quite a few people already at the entrance, and a smile naturally appeared on his face.

Then he heard someone's voice nearby.

"Hyun-woo?"

"Huh?"

It was Kim Ah-young.

"When did you get here?"

"Just now."

"Oh, I see."

"I even bought clothes there. I was the first customer as soon as it opened."

"Haha..."

Lee Hyun-woo gave an awkward laugh.

He was grateful and grateful that Kim Ah-young did something he hadn't done himself.

But it wasn't just Kim Ah-young.

Lee Hyun-woo was surprised to see someone coming out of the store.

"What...?"

It was Kim Ah-jin.

"She came here to repay all the favors she received."

"Repay favors? I didn't do much for her."

"I don't know. She must have felt she received a lot. Ah, Na-yoon will come after school. She just called."

"This... my girlfriend's entire family is mobilized. Really, I haven't done much for them."
