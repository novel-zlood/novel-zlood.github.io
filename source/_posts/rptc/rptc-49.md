Kim Ah-young appeared to be a very competent woman in Park Min-sook's eyes.

Predicting that she would soon realize reality and shift her attention, she chimed in.

"I'll contact them then."

"Go ahead. Oh, wait a moment."

"Yes?"

"Since we can't just ask them to reveal their blog without any reason, how about we offer them something they want first? After all, transactions are based on mutual exchange."

"That makes sense, but what should we offer?"

"Could you find that out for me?"

"Yes, Director. I'll do that."

Reluctantly, Park Min-sook had no choice but to act.

She then mobilized all the methods she knew.

This was because she saw urgency on Kim Ah-young's face just a moment ago.

In fact, whether by choice or circumstances, the sons and daughters of the 【Guseong】 family had built walls around themselves from the world.

As a result, whenever they encountered matters of the outside world, it always felt precarious.

Kim Ah-young was no different now.

Though she was older, she appeared as a teenage girl in Park Min-sook's eyes.

'If I don't provide the information quickly, who knows what she might do.'

Thanks to Park Min-sook's swift instructions and her subordinates' prompt execution, they obtained the information within a day.

It wasn't difficult, actually.

Since 【Jungle】 wasn't a company that did business in secrecy, it was easy to notice.

With the gathered information, she went back to Kim Ah-young.

"【Jungle】 has been putting effort into media relations recently."

"Media relations?"

"They are preparing to launch a news service on their newly launched portal site."

"Ah..."

Kim Ah-young nodded, her eyes sparkling as if she understood.

"That's good. Before contacting CEO Lee Hyun-woo, we should prepare for that first."

Kim Ah-young quickly took out her phone.

And, of course, she called her uncle, the owner of 【Sejong Daily】.

She planned to ask him a favor, as he particularly adored her.

Thinking of it as a prerequisite to meeting Lee Hyun-woo.

* * *

Meanwhile, Lee Hyun-woo encountered Kang Dong-ho, who had returned to the company by the end of the day.

His expression wasn't bad.

"Did they agree?"

"They asked for a little more time."

"Then there's not much change from last time."

"The nuance was different. Last time, they spoke dismissively, but today it felt like they might consider prioritizing our portal’s news service. I got a similar response from other media companies as well."

A smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo's face.

That meant these newspapers had seen his blog.

They must have also caught wind of the news that the 【Korea Information and Communications Institute】 had successfully developed the core CDMA chip.

Perhaps they even discovered that both 【Guseong】 and 【GB】 were researching the core chip.

Korean media and conglomerates had an inseparable relationship.

'In that case, cooperation on the news service might come sooner than expected.'

Just as he thought this, his phone rang.

"Hello?"

(Hello?)

It was a familiar female voice.

Who could it be? As soon as he thought this, the caller identified herself.

(It's Kim Ah-young. We met at 【Seorabeol Hotel】 before.)

"Oh, hello."

(I'm calling regarding the news service with 【Jungle】.)

"Pardon?"

He was momentarily stunned by her mention of the news service but soon recalled 【Sejong Daily】.

'Come to think of it, this woman is the niece of the owner of 【Sejong Daily】, right?'

Was she trying to provide some information?

Why?

Although he didn't know the reason, he decided to gratefully accept it.

Moreover, since Kim Ah-young was an advertiser for 【Jungle】's portal site, Lee Hyun-woo responded politely.

"This is a field I'm very interested in these days, so that's great."

(Shall we meet up then?)

"Sure. I'll come by tomorrow."

(Tomorrow...?)

"It's almost time to get off work today. I never meet people for business after work."

Of course, there were times when he would be flexible, but the situation was different now.

If he appeared urgent, it might seem like he was trying to negotiate using this information.

After hanging up, he pondered what Kim Ah-young might want.

The conclusion was clear.

'【Sejong Daily】 is trying to use the news service to find out who Nostradamus is.'

Perhaps both 【Sejong Daily】 and 【Guseong】 wanted to know the identity of Nostradamus.

This was because 【Guseong】 was also researching the core CDMA chip.

So, they must have thought mobilizing Kim Ah-young, who had an acquaintance with Lee Hyun-woo, was the best method.

'But what to do?'

Lee Hyun-woo had no intention of revealing Nostradamus's identity.

He was certain that the media companies like 【Sejong】 would cooperate with 【Jungle】 regardless.

'It's just a matter of time.'

With this firm determination, Lee Hyun-woo visited 【Seorabeol Hotel】 the next morning.

"Welcome."

"Long time no see."

Today, Kim Ah-young, dressed in a neat office look, greeted him with a determined look on her face.

Lee Hyun-woo once again said to himself as he looked at her.

'Nostradamus's identity is absolutely off-limits.'

On the other hand, Kim Ah-young began an unexpected conversation after the greeting.

"CEO, why has another scandal article popped up?"

"...?"

Sometimes, people accidentally blurt out what they have been thinking deeply about without realizing it.

For Kim Ah-young, this was that moment.

'Why did I ask that?'

Even though she had heard multiple times that there was nothing between Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Yoon-sun, she desperately wanted to hear it from him directly.

She had been constantly repeating it inside, and now she couldn't control herself and asked.

Kim Ah-young's heart was burning with anxiety after posing the question.

'How do I handle this?'

While Kim Ah-young worried about handling the situation, Lee Hyun-woo was slightly taken aback.

'Is this a strategy?'

He suspected this is a negotiation tactic.

Kim Ah-young, representing 【Sejong】 and 【Guseong】, might be offering the news service in exchange for finding out Nostradamus's identity.

But unexpectedly, she brought up the scandal.

Since it could have been a tactic to catch him off guard, he regained his composure and spoke.

"It seems there's not much political news lately. Drama and sports don't seem interesting either. So they just wrote a novel using Yoon-sun and me as subjects."

"Yoon-sun..."

"Oh, she's a friend. Since we're the same age, I suggested we be friends recently."

"I'm the same age too."

"Pardon?"

"Never mind."

He didn't ask because he didn't hear.

Clearly, Kim Ah-young had said that she was the same age too.

Why would she deny it now?

'Is this also a strategy?'

In his past life, Lee Hyun-woo had heard that Kim Ah-young, unlike most women, was bold and cold.

Although he had never met her in person, he heard she was decisive.

Why was she bringing up such unexpected topics now?

Could it be to distract him?

'This might be the 【Guseong】 way. Since the conversation is so unpredictable, I need to stay more alert.'

Lee Hyun-woo looked straight at Kim Ah-young, who was intentionally causing confusion.

He wore a more relaxed expression and smiled.

Perhaps because of this, Kim Ah-young's face quickly turned red.

It seemed like her strategy wasn't working well.

Taking this opportunity, Lee Hyun-woo finally started his offense.

"Yesterday, you mentioned the news service over the phone?"

"Oh, that? Actually, I accidentally ran into the chairman of 【Sejong Daily】 yesterday. Then I happened to hear that 【Jungle】 requested a news service."

"..."

"I told him that I had met you twice. Then he said he was interested in the news service."

"Is that true?"

"Yes, that's what he told me."

She's confessing too easily now.

'Is her mental state shaken because the strategy didn't work?'

Thinking his offensive tactics had worked, Lee Hyun-woo felt a sense of triumph internally.

However, he remained vigilant.

He was sure Kim Ah-young would try to ask about Nostradamus's identity.

She must be waiting for the right moment.

"Just wait a bit. You might get some good news."

"Thank you for letting me know."

"Not at all. Personally, I hope 【Jungle】's portal site does well. That way, our 【Seorabeol Hotel】 can gain more advertising benefits."

"Ah, that's right. Then I'll tell my staff to increase the exposure frequency."

"Could you... do that?"

"Of course. Having received such good information, it's only right to do so."

Lee Hyun-woo found the key to equivalent exchange here.

Instead of revealing Nostradamus, he would increase the frequency of advertisement exposure!

'A successful transaction.'

Of course, he hadn't gained anything yet.

Naturally, this transaction would be complete once he received a call from 【Sejong Daily】, and then he planned to increase the advertisement exposure frequency.

Meanwhile, Kim Ah-young was pouting as the conversation didn't go as planned.

'This wasn't it.'

When Lee Hyun-woo stood up, she felt disappointed.

It was annoying that he did nothing but talk business.

So she blurted out another question without controlling herself.

"Can anyone be friends if they're the same age?"

"..."

"Just... since I'm the same age too, I wondered why you didn't suggest being friends."

Then Lee Hyun-woo nodded with a smile.

"If you want, of course, we can be friends."

"Then we can be friends."

"Deal."

"Deal?"

"We're friends from now on."

"Oh... Ok, then we're friends from now on."

Feeling like she had finally gained something, Kim Ah-young's face lit up.

But Park Min-sook, her secretary watching from the side, felt heavy-hearted.

'What on earth are you planning?'

* * *

Sometimes, information from a past life, or preconceptions and prejudices, could confuse a regressor.

Lee Hyun-woo was in such a state now.

He pondered as he returned to the company.

'What exactly did Kim Ah-young gain?'

No matter how he calculated, there was nothing.

It seemed like Lee Hyun-woo was the only one who gained.

She had said that the success of the portal site would maximize the advertising effect for 【Seorabeol Hotel】, but that was a far-off story.

By the time he reached his office, he had concluded.

'She's convinced of 【Jungle】's success!'

In his past life, he had always heard that Kim Ah-young had inherited the judgment and business acumen of the head of the 【Guseong Group】.

Wasn't her father the one who laid the foundation for 【Guseong】 to thrive in the semiconductor industry?

Hence, she seemed to have an inkling that the portal site, auction, and shopping would achieve tremendous success in the future.

No, judging by today, she seemed almost certain.

That's why she might be trying to make Lee Hyun-woo feel indebted.

The primary reason developed countries provide aid to underdeveloped countries is to eventually dominate them.

In other words, they make the underdeveloped countries feel indebted, regard them as benefactors, and make them economically and militarily dependent on the developed countries.

Kim Ah-young surely applied this strategy.

'Then she might suggest an investment later.'

Lee Hyun-woo's scenario was focused on this.
