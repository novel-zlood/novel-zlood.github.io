The words Kim Yoon-soo said the previous day seemed to have this meaning.

He said his father studies a lot before meeting people.

And that he is different from himself.

'That's right, he is different from this hyung.'

So, Lee Hyun-woo became more curious.

What level of knowledge does an elderly man over 70 have?

It seems Lee Hyun-woo's question will soon be answered.

"I want to see how the workers at Jungle operate and the methods they use. And it would be great if you could show me the modems needed for high-speed internet like ADSL."

The terminology coming out of his mouth was different from that of modern elderly people.

"Of course. I should show you."

Anyway, it was something that Kim Yoon-soo also had to see.

They couldn't avoid showing the products they were asked to make.

So, Lee Hyun-woo led the two out of the CEO's office, and as they walked, the old man's voice could be heard.

"My second son got scared after hearing about President Hwang Il-ho. He said the market for budget computers will become even more competitive, right?"

"That's correct. And when supply increases, there will be issues with price competitiveness."

"So, you recommended the modem to my second son because a solid weapon is needed?"

"Yes, that's correct."

It seemed that Kim Yoon-soo's father not only knew President Hwang Il-ho but also understood the principles of supply and demand well.

It was the moment when it was confirmed that his business sense was much better than Kim Yoon-soo's.

'I heard that hyung has siblings, maybe they informed this elderly man?'

That could be possible, but if a person doesn't want to understand, the information won't accumulate in their head.

Lee Hyun-woo's parents were also completely ignorant when it came to computers and the information industry.

Therefore, he had no choice but to hold Kim Yoon-soo's father, Kim Dong-baek, in higher regard.

"My second son trusts our CEO Lee very much. He said he wants to push ahead with it right away. He trusts the CEO so much that he would believe it even if you said you could make soybean paste out of red beans."

"I'm just grateful that you trust me. Here we are."

Finally, the three arrived downstairs while talking.

And immediately, Lee Hyun-woo showed the ADSL modem to Kim Dong-baek and Kim Yoon-soo.

"I need to explain from now on..."

Although he confirmed the elderly man's high level of information knowledge, Lee Hyun-woo hesitated, worried that he might not understand when he showed the modem.

Then, Kim Dong-baek looked at Lee Hyun-woo with sharp eyes uncharacteristic of an elderly man and asked for an explanation.

"It's okay, go ahead."

"Yes, I understand."

"......"

"In fact, the high-speed internet ADSL here has already been tested and concluded to be ready for commercial service soon."

"I heard about that too."

"That's a relief. Then, these kinds of modems will be installed here and there, right?"

"That would be the case."

"How many would be needed just for distribution in Seoul?"

"It's hard to imagine. It's not only for homes, right?"

"Of course not. Businesses like ours would use it too."

"Then at least a few million units."

"It won't spread that rapidly. But it's clear that the total number of subscribers will exceed one million by next year."

"Next year isn't far off."

"That's right. So, One Computer needs to start making them quickly."

"Is that possible?"

Now, doubt appeared in the old man's eyes.

It was inevitable.

While assembling complete computers involves putting together various parts, making the core components requires technology.

The problem is that the technology cannot be acquired instantly.

So, to explain the solution, Lee Hyun-woo began another story.

"Next week, someone from the company that makes this modem is coming."

"Here?"

"Yes, and the company is in Belgium."

Kim Dong-baek looked at Lee Hyun-woo for a moment, who had not immediately solved his question, then nodded and examined the modem again before speaking.

"I see. This modem was made in Belgium."

"Yes, their products are the best. Actually, there aren't many places that make this. One in Belgium, one in the U.S. The U.S. one has similar performance but is more expensive. So, we had no choice but to use the Belgian product."

"The Belgian company will be very successful."

"For now, yes. We've already ordered 100,000 units."

"100... 100,000 units? Why?"

"We plan to import and sell them to Daehan Electricity and Daehan Telecom."

"......!"

"Perhaps those two companies also placed orders in Belgium. But it won't be a large quantity. Because they might think there won't be many subscribers."

This was based on past experience and intuition.

Even back then, the unimaginable surge in subscribers significantly delayed the initial high-speed internet installations.

So why don't they think of ordering enough to have stock?

It's said that just managing inventory well can prevent losses in business activities.

In other words, if they order too much and the goods don't leave the warehouse, it results in huge losses.

Lee Hyun-woo also experienced overworking due to inventory management failures in his previous life.

'At least I can predict the demand for modems.'

This will be a one-time thing.

Once internet service providers experience a big hit, they will naturally increase their stock.

"Anyway, this will be the only time we make a profit in the middle, but the record of a large order will remain. I will use this record to contact the company in the U.S. and propose OEM production in Korea."

"Ah! Now I get it!"

Finally, Kim Dong-baek raised his voice as if he realized something.

"You mentioned earlier that the U.S. modem is expensive, so if we do OEM production in Korea, we can lower the price."

"That's correct. Wow, you understood right away without a lengthy explanation."

"More than that, I'm amazed at the incredible business acumen you've shown. My son really met a benefactor."

With such excessive praise and continuous respectful speech, Lee Hyun-woo felt quite burdened.

But listening to what Kim Dong-baek was saying, he now knew for sure that Kim Yoon-soo would be supported.

Kim Yoon-soo looked silently at Lee Hyun-woo from behind his father, as if he was overwhelmed.

Lee Hyun-woo felt like 'Thank you' was written in his eyes, making his heart feel lighter.

This was why Lee Hyun-woo couldn't help but smile.

* * *

In the evening, Kim Yoon-soo suggested having a drink of soju, and the two moved to a bar they had frequented a few times.

After downing a glass of soju, Kim Yoon-soo immediately spoke the words he had been holding back.

"Thank you, CEO Lee."

"Oh, no need to thank me."

"No, I really mean it. I did some calculations. You mentioned earlier that more than a million households could subscribe to high-speed internet next year. If the modem costs about 10,000 won, that's a revenue of 10 billion won."

"Revenue is not important. Profit is what matters."

"Who disagrees? Anyway, this business is sustainable. Also, I know that high-speed internet won't be used only in Korea. Over time, Japan, Taiwan, and eventually China will use it as well... Wow, I can't even calculate it."

"Don't get ahead of yourself. After pioneering the blue ocean, competitors will emerge. You've already faced that phenomenon in the budget computer market."

"Right, Hwang Il-ho might be the start, but if his model succeeds, others will follow and enter this market. Ah, I need to revise my goal. I used to want to become the world's largest computer manufacturer, but now I realize that's not easy."

"No, you can do it."

"Oh, you don't need to say that. I know my limits."

"Dream big. Right now, it's modems, but in the future, you can develop network equipment needed for computers."

"Really?"

"It's not impossible."

It wasn't difficult to inspire ambition in someone with a receptive ear.

"Moreover, you can continue developing other parts besides network equipment. What will happen then? You can make computers with those parts. As the parts become integrated, the unit cost will naturally drop... ensuring your price competitiveness."

"That's right."

"What's important here is to reinvest a portion of the company's profits appropriately. I don't know how you use the money you're earning now, but you need to increase the proportion of investment in research and development. Only then can you produce your own modems instead of relying on OEM, and later develop new parts."

"Yes, I understand. I'll give it a try."

Encouraged by Lee Hyun-woo's instigation, Kim Yoon-soo felt a surge of courage.

Of course, the mountains he had to overcome wouldn't be low.

But having Lee Hyun-woo close by would be reassuring.

"What would have happened if I hadn't met CEO Lee?"

"With your personality, you would have met another benefactor."

"What?"

"Even though you're easily swayed, your generous nature doesn't change."

"A lot of people take advantage of that."

"Of course. Honestly, I also took advantage of your nature at first. That's why I bought parts at almost cost price."

"Ha ha, is that so?"

"Yes, but eventually, I felt grateful for your generosity, and I felt sorry for taking advantage of your nature because I had no money, so I wanted to help you somehow later. Someone like me would have appeared by your side."

Would that really be the case?

Probably not.

Kim Yoon-soo knew that Lee Hyun-woo was saying it nicely.

He couldn't help but feel a constant prickle in his heart.

But he silently repeated it to himself, thinking it might sound too light to say out loud.

'I will consider you my lifelong benefactor.'

* * *

These days, he doesn't drink a lot to avoid being burdened with work the next day.

So, when Lee Hyun-woo arrived home, he greeted his parents, then went back to his room and took out his notebook.

Although not as meticulous as Han Se-jin, Lee Hyun-woo always made sure not to neglect his records to avoid missing anything.

Opening the notebook, he saw that everything he had touched so far was continuously connecting.

<MP3 files → Development of MP3 player by Alpha Cast>

<High-speed internet → Network business triggered by Samjin Computers>

And today, he felt he had to add another one.

<Modem → OEM production by One Computer>

However, for all this to truly connect, results were needed.

The MP3 player, another form of high-speed internet, and the OEM modem had yet to appear.

The economy does not fall under the moral or ethical realm that values the process.

No matter how good the process is, without results, it would all be in vain.

'I hope something hits.'

Was it because this wish was so earnest?

The next day, Jung Sung-woo, the CEO of Alpha Cast, came to see Lee Hyun-woo and took out an item.

"After several trial and error, this one works fine, so I brought it to show you."

Seeing the small music player, a smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo's face.
