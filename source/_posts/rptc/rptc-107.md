As soon as he got to work, Yoo Jin-young informed him that there was another call from the U.S.

(Hello? CEO?)

“Yeah, it’s me. What is it this time?”

Oh Min-woo called so often that it wasn’t even surprising anymore.

Today, he must have participated in a forum at 【Stanford】,

(I met some really impressive guys today.)

He had a feeling.

(They weren’t as good as me and Jung-woo, but their ideas were no joke.)

“Who are they?”

(I don’t think you’d know their names. They’re the ones who hypothesized the first stage of our search engine. They’re preparing to present their paper next month. Unfortunately, they’re behind us and need major revisions.)

“Really? They must be quite talented.”

(As I said, if we hadn’t created our search engine, these guys would have made something almost identical. Actually, if we hadn’t met them today, they would have continued to research in that direction.)

Listening, a name kept coming to mind.

Ray Burrin.

Mikhail Pace.

The founders of 【Single】, who held immense power in the IT ecosystem in his past life.

‘If it’s now, they’d probably be in graduate school at 【Stanford】, so there’s a high probability.’

He was curious but not enough to ask for their names.

Anyway, Oh Min-woo was spilling all the details.

(Later, Ray personally logged into 【Jungle】 to check the performance of our search engine. He shook his head with a pale face, saying it was wrong. He was planning to make a lot of money.)

“Did he really say that?”

(It was his expression.)

“Haha… Got it, got it.”

(Huh? You don’t seem very surprised?)

“About what?”

(That they discovered the search engine algorithm later than us at Stanford in the U.S.)

“It’s surprising. It’s only natural. You and Jung-woo are the best, aren’t you?”

He said what he wanted to hear, ‘Ujjujju.’

(You finally acknowledge that we are competent.)

“Yeah, I already miss you guys.”

(Hold on. I need to stop by 【Alta Beast】 before coming back.)

“Alright.”

(By the way, the folks at 【Alta Beast】 are really anxious. They’re worried we might partner up with 【Yaho】.)

That would never happen.

Even if 【Jungle】 wanted to, 【Yaho】 would never accept.

‘That’s the company that dismissed the search engine algorithm even when Ray and Mikhail took it.’

That was the story from his past life.

Of course, things could change in this life, but the probability seemed low.

However, just as 【Single】 eventually accepted the search engine in his past life and declined, it might be the same with 【Jungle】 in this life.

‘The search engine created by Ray Burrin and Mikhail Pace will probably be much worse than ours, so this seems more plausible.’

He was starting to get curious about the future.

How would 【Yaho】 change?

Would 【Single】 even come into existence?

Could 【Alta Beast】 endure for a long time?

The next day, Woo Sang-won and Jang Yoo-cheol finally returned.

This time, Lee Hyun-woo went out to greet them.

As soon as they got into the car, Woo Sang-won made a remark.

“Don’t you think you need a driver, CEO?”

“No, it’s fine. I prefer it this way.”

It was true.

Lee Hyun-woo enjoyed driving.

Even in his past life, when the company offered him a driver, he refused and drove himself.

The thrill of starting the engine, pressing the accelerator, and feeling the car move still gave Lee Hyun-woo a rush.

“By the way, CEO, you don’t know German, do you?”

“I do.”

“What? Really?”

“I learned it as a second foreign language in high school and found it interesting, so I kept studying.”

It was true, and he had also spent about two years as an expatriate in Germany in his past life, so while he wasn’t fluent, he could hold conversations to some extent.

“Wow, Jung-woo was right; you’re a genius.”

“Manager Jang, compared to the two who created the MP3, I’m nothing.”

Lee Hyun-woo laughed as Jang Yoo-cheol interrupted.

“But why do you ask about German?”

“I brought some German newspapers. I was going to ask someone who knows German to translate them…”

“Oh, I can do that for you.”

He wondered why they brought German newspapers out of curiosity.

While thinking this, the two insisted on going back to the company.

“It’s almost quitting time.”

“Please, just this once.”

“Yeah, I really want to read the German newspapers accurately. I heard there were a lot of articles about Jungle.”

Did they hear that at the forum?

Lee Hyun-woo reluctantly turned the car around and headed back to 【Jungle】.

When they arrived and went upstairs, Yoo Jin-young looked surprised to see the three of them.

“Jin-young, I’ll have a coffee.”

“I’ll have a coffee with lots of sugar, please.”

They quickly placed their orders with Yoo Jin-young as if they were at a coffee shop and then went into the CEO’s office and handed Lee Hyun-woo the newspapers.

Lee Hyun-woo awkwardly smiled as he accepted the newspapers.

“Let’s see. Deutsche Telekom, considering entering the music industry in partnership with 【Jungle】? What?”

“Really?”

“Seriously?”

“No way. We haven’t received any contact. Oh… here it says they are reviewing it.”

“Oh…”

“Yes…”

“Let’s check the other newspapers.”

Another newspaper mentioned that the MP3 files developed by 【Jungle】 were establishing a new form of business in Korea.

The other newspapers mainly introduced the company, 【Jungle】.

After summarizing these articles, the two men smiled proudly while sipping the coffee Yoo Jin-young brought.

They seemed to feel a sense of pride.

Lee Hyun-woo let them enjoy the moment of joy in silence for a while.

Then Woo Sang-won broke the silence.

“At the forum, a few people mentioned that while the U.S. set the standards for the internet, and the UK for the World Wide Web, Korea seems to be setting the standards for music.”

Another wave of pride washed over them.

To fully enjoy the mood, Lee Hyun-woo added another dose of national pride.

“Music alone won’t cut it. We need to set the standards for search engines, portals, online auctions and shopping, and even SNS.”

“Yes, that’s right. But what’s SNS?”

“Oh, that?”

Lee Hyun-woo realized he had slipped.

He had mentioned something that hadn’t even come out yet.

“That’s the big thing Oh Team-leader came up with. Creating connections through blogs and finding friends.”

“Oh, the thing you mentioned last time?”

“Yes, I named it ‘Social Networking Service.’ It means a network of relationships among people. The acronym is SNS. But of course, I’m the only one calling it that for now.”

They had already heard about this blog from Lee Hyun-woo when they were in Germany.

The thought of finally being able to see it made them excited.

“Let’s go check it out. There are quite a few interesting features.”

They must have been really curious.

As soon as he finished speaking, the two stood up and went outside.

At the same time, Yoo Jin-young entered the room.

“Uh… I was wondering if I could leave now.”

Lee Hyun-woo suddenly looked at the time.

It was already past six.

“Oh? Why haven’t you left yet?”

“I couldn’t leave while you were still here… But I have to go to my English conversation class soon.”

“Next time, let me know about such things in advance, and make sure to leave on time.”

Yoo Jin-young hesitated to respond.

Despite working together for almost a year, she still couldn’t raise her voice in front of Lee Hyun-woo.

Even now, she spoke in a voice barely louder than a mosquito’s as she left, making Lee Hyun-woo chuckle.

‘They say you can’t change a person’s nature.’

In that sense, Woo Sang-won and Jang Yoo-cheol also seemed unable to change their developer nature.

Especially as developers who created the MP3 player, they were now discussing something amazing.

* * *

“Manager, don’t you feel like we’re a step behind?”

“Yeah. They’ve done something amazing.”

“Looking at this, I don’t know if you’ll be satisfied with what we’re developing.”

Jang Yoo-cheol’s face hardened as he examined the blog.

It felt like his friend Oh Min-woo had once again taken a step ahead.

Woo Sang-won felt similarly.

“There’s a friend recommendation feature here.”

“Yes, I see a high school friend among the ‘People You May Know’ suggestions.”

For this to work, users need to update their personal information.

In other words, new fields such as place of birth, alma mater, and current workplace were added to the personal information section.

Of course, there was an option to make this public or private, so it was up to the user to disclose it.

“Phew, I feel like messaging my old friends. Just as Manager Jang said, what we’ve designed might get overshadowed. But on the flip side, doesn’t this feature make the blog more active?”

“Indeed. Even those who haven’t created a blog might do so now.”

“That’s good for us. The more blog users, the more music files we can sell.”

“Shall we tell the CEO about this?”

“Yeah, let’s talk to him right away.”

The two had just arrived in Korea today.

But as soon as they arrived, they were already engrossed in work.

At the same time, they were strategizing to avoid getting scolded by Lee Hyun-woo.

“Even though the CEO hasn’t left yet, it’s no longer working hours, so he might not listen to our ideas.”

“He might not just ignore us but even kick us out.”

“Shall we ask him to buy us some beer?”

“Haha, we drank plenty in Germany…”

“Let’s just say we missed Korean beer.”

And so, they managed to drag Lee Hyun-woo to a nearby pub.

After downing a refreshing beer, Woo Sang-won started the conversation.

“CEO, we secretly designed something before going to Germany.”

“What is it?”

Fortunately, Lee Hyun-woo responded well.

“Isn’t the current blog too plain?”

“That couldn’t be helped. It was made during the modem era.”

“Yes, but now we are in the era of high-speed internet.”

“Right.”

“Now, users should be able to customize their blogs.”

“Right…”

Lee Hyun-woo responded with a voice full of expectation.

He even swallowed hard, listening intently to Woo Sang-won’s next words.

“Team Leader Oh has already updated the blog for better engagement. Now, we add design to it. We could even sell good designs. Especially, celebrity backgrounds would be great. Of course, we’d need to negotiate trademark fees first.”

“That can be handled by Manager Han or Manager Kang.”

“Yes, and also music. We could allow background music. The original creators would get additional income, we’d profit, and users would have more vibrant blogs.”

“Great! That’s fantastic! Let’s start implementing it tomorrow!”
