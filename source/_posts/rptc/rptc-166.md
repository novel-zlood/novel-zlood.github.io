Monday morning after the weekend.

As soon as Lee Hyun-woo arrived at work, he turned on his computer and logged onto the internet.

"What the heck is this?"

He discovered that more friend requests than ever had come in.

Among them was Choi Sun-hwa, whom he met last time, seemingly just now paying attention to her blog.

"Huh? Why did everyone from that family send me friend requests?"

Kim Tae-hyun, Kim Ah-jin, and Kim Na-yoon, the three siblings, had sent friend requests to Lee Hyun-woo.

He clicked on each one and checked them out.

It was clear that Kim Tae-hyun and Kim Ah-jin didn’t manage their blogs at all.

But Kim Na-yoon...

"She decorates well."

She had spent money on the background and BGM to decorate her blog.

The posts and pictures she uploaded were the same.

Perhaps because she was the daughter of a wealthy family, she was taking photos of her daily life with the latest digital camera and uploading them to her blog.

Lee Hyun-woo couldn’t have predicted that the youngest daughter of the secretive Guseong family would enjoy blogging so much.

"Did she do that in her past life too?"

Back then, Lee Hyun-woo hadn’t paid much attention to social media, so there was no way to confirm.

If he had known he would live life twice, he would have enjoyed it to the fullest.

"Still, it’s fortunate. Given a second life, I must experience everything before I die."

That included the human relationships he vowed to improve yesterday.

In his previous life, he regretted most being buried in work and neglecting relationships.

Ring-ring!

Whenever his phone rang like now, he couldn’t help but greet it warmly for existing or new relationships.

(Hello?)

"Hello?"

(Oh, Hyun-woo, it’s me.)

"Oh, Ah-young."

(Do you have some time after work today?)

"Huh? Of course, I do. But what’s the occasion? It’s rare for you to ask."

Kim Ah-young usually asked when he finished work.

So Lee Hyun-woo would answer 'late' if he had something to do and 'on time' if he didn’t.

The former meant he couldn’t meet today.

The latter, of course, meant he should come.

(Oh, I’m planning to bring Ah-jin today.)

This was an unexpected statement.

"Really? That sounds good. But has Ah-jin returned to Korea?"

(Yeah, she’s about to graduate, and once she takes her test next month, she’s done. So she’s officially started working today. And right about now, she’s probably discussing the online fashion mall with the team from First Textile that you mentioned.)

"Got it."

He roughly organized the purpose of today’s meeting in his mind.

"They must want help."

The work on First Textile’s website had already started.

It was because Lee Hyun-woo had given instructions to the relevant department last week.

Also, he had told Kim Ah-young several times about the successful strategies for the fashion mall.

But passing the information through someone else inevitably weakened its impact.

"Alright, for my future sister-in-law, I'll teach her the perfect way to run a fashion mall today."

So he said,

"Why not have Na-yoon come too?"

(Na-yoon too?)

"Yeah, I came up with a good marketing idea."

(Really? Alright, I’ll do that.)

What kind of marketing could it be that he even called the youngest, Kim Na-yoon?

Although Kim Ah-young’s voice was full of such nuance, Lee Hyun-woo didn’t need to explain over the phone.

Anyway, the content would be unveiled during dinner.

* * *

That evening, Lee Hyun-woo met the three sisters.

The meeting place was a restaurant with a private room, isolated from other areas.

"Long time no see, Ah-jin, and Na-yoon."

Lee Hyun-woo greeted them one by one with both politeness and ease as they walked in.

Kim Na-yoon was the first to respond.

"Na-yoon? It feels a bit odd when you call me that."

"Then what should I call you?"

"Just Na-yoon."

"Alright, I’ll call you that."

"And speak informally too."

"I will."

Kim Na-yoon was so surprised that she opened her eyes wide as Lee Hyun-woo accepted all her requests.

So what could Kim Ah-jin do?

"Speak informally to me too."

"Alright, I will."

It seemed that from now on, there wouldn’t be a situation where Lee Hyun-woo had to speak formally to the three women.

Instead, the beginning was a reconnaissance battle.

Although they had met a few times, they had never had deep conversations, so the chats were exploratory.

"You must be busy as a senior in high school."

"Busy and frustrated. I’m grateful you called me out today. Oppa called… Ah, can I call you oppa?"

"Of course."

"Yes, when I said oppa called me out, Mom didn’t say anything and even postponed my tutoring."

"You’re getting tutoring too?"

"Honestly, I don’t need it, but they want me to get into a good college… Our parents care too much about appearances."

At this point, Kim Ah-jin subtly interjected.

"They just think you should cover the basics. You can’t go to a weird college alone."

"Why not?"

"Is that even a question? Is your puberty not over yet?"

"I don’t even remember when it started."

"Are you two really going to fight here?"

Finally, Kim Ah-young intervened to stop them, and Lee Hyun-woo laughed and said,

"Come to think of it, except for Na-yoon, the other three of us went through the same education process. Studying boringly to get into college. But these days, I envy Na-yoon the most."

"Me? Why?"

"When I was in high school, there was nothing to enjoy. Although there still isn’t much, with the evolution of internet cafes, PC rooms started to appear, and even if not, you can communicate with people from home via computers. Especially looking at Na-yoon’s blog, you have a huge fan base."

"It just happened… After an article about me using a blog came out in the newspaper, people started flocking in."

"Oh, that happened."

"But I think I won’t be able to do that anymore."

"Why?"

"My digital camera was confiscated. For not studying… If only someone hadn’t tattled."

"You keep… Sigh, I won’t say anything."

Judging by Kim Ah-jin’s reaction, it was clear who had tattled.

Lee Hyun-woo showed a somewhat troubled expression.

"This is a big deal."

"..."

"..."

"Why?"

Kim Ah-young asked the reason for Lee Hyun-woo’s words while the other two remained silent.

"The thing is, I was going to tell you today how to completely grab everyone’s attention in the early stages of Guseong’s fashion mall."

"And?"

"The key was Na-yoon’s blog."

"What?"

"Honestly, you, Ah-jin, and Na-yoon are all pretty. Your styles are also amazing. But the public perceives the eldest and second daughters as hard to approach. Moreover, both of you intentionally stay away from the public. But Na-yoon isn’t like that. How should I put it? Showing the daily life of a prestigious family through the blog might be the right expression, and because of that, your peers especially admire it."

"Some people don’t see it positively."

"Those people will always see things negatively no matter what. But as I said earlier, the perfect marketing to draw people’s attention was Na-yoon’s blog."

For a moment, the three women’s eyes widened.

Except for Kim Na-yoon, it was hard for them to accept what Lee Hyun-woo had said.

In the end, Kim Ah-young spoke up again.

"Hyun-woo, don’t you think that’s a bit too much? Na-yoon isn’t a model..."

"No, but when else would she ever do it? As I said before, although it applies to both of you, Na-yoon’s clothing style is so impressive that her peers are racing to compliment her. You can easily see this by looking at the blog comments."

It was true.

Peers who admired Kim Na-yoon’s style were curious about the clothes, sunglasses, shoes, and accessories she wore.

And even if Kim Na-yoon didn’t reply to each comment, someone would find out and it would spread widely, something Lee Hyun-woo discovered today.

"She meets all the conditions of an excellent influencer."

Of course, he didn’t plan to persuade these three persistently.

So he decided to take a step back at this point.

"I’d like you to see this as a personal opinion. I just thought it would be fun and suggested it. Now... I have to talk about something boring."

From this point, Lee Hyun-woo started talking about the fashion mall’s operational strategy.

"As you know, the cost price of a brand sold in a department store is only 30% of the selling price. Therefore, setting the goal is crucial, but selling new products has issues. Why? Because First Textile has to sell goods not only online but also offline. So, we need to adopt a strategy to consume the leftover stock from past seasons..."

Naturally, Kim Ah-jin’s concentration was at its peak.

Although Lee Hyun-woo said it was a boring story, it was something she was highly interested in, so it went straight into her ears.

On the other hand, the youngest, Kim Na-yoon, let all the content pass by.

More precisely, she was thinking about something else.

"This oppa is right. Just looking at the blog comments, there’s a lot of interest in the clothes I wear. If I connect this to marketing, it would be incredible."

Originally, Kim Na-yoon didn’t seem like a chaebol daughter in her past life either.

Instead, she created the "Pretty Na-yoon’s" homepage on Sign World and shared her trivial daily life.

Later, she even posted photos taken with her boyfriend and personal photos.

Especially, it included anecdotes with her family, who rarely appeared in public, making her popular among netizens.

This ordinary personality was formed because she received a lot of love growing up as the youngest daughter, and it wouldn’t change in this life either.

"I’ll just do it."

After Lee Hyun-woo finished all his advice, she suddenly blurted out.

"..."

"..."

Her two older sisters remained silent, and Lee Hyun-woo smiled broadly.

Unsurprisingly, Kim Ah-young’s belated ‘stop’ followed.

"What are you going to say to Dad?"

"I’ll just listen."

"What?"

"Nagging from Dad and Mom has increased a lot as a senior in high school. It’s not going to decrease anyway. I get a lot of stress because of it, so I’ll relieve it with this. I like uploading photos to my blog and communicating with other netizens."

"That’s not what I’m saying. Do it, go ahead. But if you upload it to your blog, wearing our company’s clothes, as if a chaebol daughter is advertising the company’s products..."

"Then I just won’t wear our company’s clothes?"

"..."

"Oppa, what would happen if I don’t wear our company’s clothes?"

Now she turned her gaze to Lee Hyun-woo, asking for his opinion, assuming he would side with her.

Then Lee Hyun-woo quickly responded with a super excited expression.

"I can’t say much about that, but since we’re here... can you officially wear the clothes our company sells?"

"Huh?"

"To be precise, the clothes my father’s company sells."

"Your father’s company?"

"Yeah, he recently mentioned dealing with clothing, so he brought in a lot of stock from various companies. And he plans to secure clothes from Dongdaemun wholesale stores. Online sales will start next week through Jungle, and it would be great if you could promote it on your blog. Oh, and in case you’re worried, I assure you this method will also improve Guseong’s image. If a chaebol daughter wears clothes sold in Dongdaemun, it would show a humble side rather than an aristocratic one, and netizens would praise it."
