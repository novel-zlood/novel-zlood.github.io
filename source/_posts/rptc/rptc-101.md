Lee Hyun-woo already suspected that he had a close relationship with his younger brother, Kim Ah-young.

However, to what extent it had progressed was only a matter of speculation.

‘But does this active assistance mean he has feelings for our An-young?’

The prediction did not turn into a question.

Such a topic would make things uncomfortable.

If so, the chances of distancing himself from Lee Hyun-woo, whom he had recently started to get along with due to mutual interests, were high.

So, he appropriately concluded the conversation and brought up the data center issue.

“I was a bit late because I had to organize things internally. I handed it over yesterday, so they’ll probably start discussing it among themselves.”

“I don’t intend to rush. We’ll need the help of the local government anyway.”

“If that’s the case, I can handle it. What do you need?”

Help is something that goes both ways.

Having received help, Kim Tae-hyun quickly continued to offer assistance.

“Permits? Or electricity? Tax benefits?”

“I’ll handle it for now, but I’ll let you know if I need anything later.”

“Sure, don’t think too hard about it, just let me know anytime.”

“Yes, hyung. Oh, but we constantly need servers, so please make sure they don’t get disconnected.”

“Got it, I’ll make a note of it.”

These days, getting good servers was like picking stars from the sky.

It meant that data accumulation was piling up like a mountain.

When he requested to secure a stable supply to prevent any interruptions, it was quickly approved.

‘Information really is money, huh?’

Lee Hyun-woo chuckled inwardly.

Top-secret information that no one else knew had an unquantifiable monetary value.

Just by mentioning the 【MiSam Group】 today, he might have helped prevent a potential loss for 【KooSung】.

Even before this, there were servers and MP3 mobile phones, so it was clear that Kim Tae-hyun did not take this lightly.

It was even better.

‘It would be really interesting to steer the direction of KooSung in the future.’

Of course, things wouldn’t go as planned, but just guiding and observing the direction would be immensely satisfying.

On his way home after parting ways with Kim Tae-hyun, various scenarios unfolded in his mind.

‘Chairman Park Yong-jin of 【SamJin】 also gave up on unnecessary things due to lack of funds.’

So how about suggesting something new to make 【KooSung】 use their funds more efficiently?

Maybe it could reduce the overproduction from the previous life.

‘Wow, the information is becoming so vast that I don’t know if my brain can handle it.’

No matter how exceptional his memory was, even Lee Hyun-woo’s brain had its limits in storing all the information.

That’s why he frequently used notebooks and blogs.

Today, too, various things were being written down in his notebook.

One of them was,

- Having moved Kim Tae-hyun, the next target is Chairman Kim Sung-moo.

An enormous plan, challenging the impossible, was being noted down.

* * *

The next day, as soon as Kim Tae-hyun arrived at work, he contacted the staff responsible for the group’s information.

(Hello?)

“Ah, Chief Yoon. It’s me.”

(Ah, yes, Director.)

“I contacted you to look into something.”

(Please go ahead.)

Originally, Yoon Tae-ho, who was now answering the phone, only gave top-secret information to his father.

However, recently, he had started subtly informing Kim Tae-hyun, who was positioning himself as the successor.

So, he first checked if he could ask for it this time too,

“It’s just that I heard rumors that the 【MiSam Group】 is not doing well.”

(Oh? That’s correct.)

The response came immediately.

“Really? Is the situation with 【MiSam Group】 really bad?”

(Yes, it is. That’s why the chairman has recently instructed us to minimize transactions. But how did you know to ask about them…)

“Ah, I heard some things too.”

Of course, it was something Lee Hyun-woo had mentioned.

And as soon as he recalled the conversation from the previous day, he couldn’t help but be impressed.

‘The power of handling portal site information is truly amazing.’

Kim Tae-hyun hung up and pondered deeply.

He, too, had been very interested in portal sites recently due to their expansion into Japan.

Though he didn’t know much else, he had directly observed the new information search form, ‘Knowledge Service,’ introduced by 【Jungle】 in the second half of last year.

Typing in a search word would automatically show results from the ‘Knowledge Service,’ so it was impossible not to know.

Then, while checking the search word rankings the previous day, he realized the power of information.

‘Does it rival the information agencies of a country?’

By finding the information an unspecified group wanted in this way and gathering that data to derive an approximate answer, he thought,

‘Maybe we can prepare for bad situations in advance.’

He reached a natural conclusion.

Kim Tae-hyun picked up the phone again and dialed the number.

(Hello?)

The recipient was Lee Hyun-woo.

“Oh, it’s me.”

(Oh? Hyung?)

A welcoming voice was heard.

Naturally, thinking there might be news he was waiting for, he quickly shared it.

“After checking, it turns out 【MiSam】 is quite unstable.”

(Oh, really?)

“Yes, I think it’s best to discourage your father. If it’s urgent, use 【KooSung Trading】. I’ll set it up.”

(If you do that, I’d be really grateful. I’ll talk to my father and get back to you. Oh, and thank you so much for taking care of this.)

“Hey, of course, I had to inform you. You’re my cherished dongsaeng.”

At this moment, Kim Tae-hyun decided to meet with Lee Hyun-woo more frequently than he had thought.

He wanted to somehow utilize the information-gathering capabilities of the portal site.

So, after hanging up, he couldn’t help but ponder.

‘Do we need to create our own portal site?’

He soon shook his head.

These days, 【Jungle】 was demonstrating that it was incredibly difficult for latecomers to catch up.

Just seeing how other portal sites that popped up like mushrooms were not operating properly was enough.

‘The timing is already late. Moreover, Hyun-woo is running it exceptionally well.’

Each person has innate abilities, and there are industries that match those abilities.

Lee Hyun-woo was born to handle portal sites and online shopping.

Recently, with 【Jungle Music】, he had made a significant impact, creating a new order in the South Korean music market.

Therefore, it seemed more appropriate to establish a relationship with him as a ‘collaborator’ or ‘business partner’ in the future.

‘By the way, my father is truly amazing.’

He felt this anew after the conversation with Lee Hyun-woo the previous day.

He had been instilling a sense of crisis in him all year long, and now, with the information that 【BoHan】 had collapsed and 【MiSam】 was likely to follow at the beginning of the new year,

‘I need to learn my father’s instincts.’

Lee Hyun-woo probably confirmed it based on the information gathered from his portal site, but his father, Kim Sung-moo, had undoubtedly spoken from pure instinct.

‘I need to go see my father today and hear how this situation might affect us.’

* * *

He wasn’t a child, so he didn’t see his father every day just because they were father and son.

Moreover, it wasn’t widely known, but Kim Tae-hyun, who had quite a reputation for womanizing, often enjoyed a free-spirited life, rarely coming home.

“What brings you home at this hour today?”

Chairman Kim Sung-moo asked with his characteristic sharp eyes, looking at Kim Tae-hyun.

It seemed he found it surprising that Kim Tae-hyun had come home in the evening.

“I have something important to discuss, father.”

“……”

“It’s about 【BoHan】 going bankrupt for sure, and then 【MiSam】, and there’s a system that predicted this perfectly.”

Kim Sung-moo’s eyebrows raised.

It meant he was interested.

Then he narrowed his eyes and asked,

“How did you know that 【MiSam】 is not doing well?”

“I heard it from the place I mentioned earlier, and I confirmed it separately.”

Kim Tae-hyun refrained from saying that he had contacted the group’s information office and moved on ambiguously.

Instead, he continued to steer the topic in the intended direction.

“I now fully understand why you always talked about crises. It means there will come a day when large corporations will collapse.”

“Hmm, yes, that’s right.”

“Your words from before have been resonating with me recently. That’s why I came home early today.”

Kim Sung-moo stared at his son for a moment.

He had reprimanded him several times for being disorganized since he was young, and today seemed no different.

Connecting systems and crises without any order.

‘Still, he’s in a mindset to heed my words, so I won’t scold him.’

Instead, his curiosity was piqued.

“What is the system you mentioned earlier?”

“The portal site of 【Jungle】, which predicted the crises of the two companies I mentioned earlier.”

“What?”

“Specifically, the CEO there receives a daily report on which words are most frequently searched on the portal site.”

A slight tremor that no one noticed appeared in Kim Sung-moo’s pupils.

‘A portal site can gather such important information that quickly?’

The head of Korea’s top group always strives not to fall behind.

Naturally, he was well aware of portal sites, search words, and so on.

But trusting his son’s words was hard.

Did he notice that gaze?

Kim Tae-hyun emphasized with a firm voice.

“Father, it’s true. And if we can sense crises based on the frequency of search words, I thought about how we could use this and felt I needed to discuss it with you.”

“If you have a willingness to learn, I’m always open to it.”

Kim Sung-moo was pleased to have a time to discuss the future with his son.

Especially since Kim Tae-hyun, who would eventually inherit the group, was now actively mentioning crises, unlike before.

‘By the way, it seems that 【Jungle】 is the trigger.’

Kim Sung-moo was also very familiar with 【Jungle】.

Recently, his son and daughter often mentioned the company at the breakfast table, which piqued his interest even more.

“You said 【Jungle】 uses search words to sense crises?”

“Yes, that’s correct.”

“But isn’t this incident more of a coincidence?”

“I also thought it could be. However, thinking that we could acquire fast information in the future, I felt it was crucial to solidify our relationship with the CEO there.”

Suddenly, the name Lee Hyun-woo popped into Kim Sung-moo’s mind, and his eyes sparkled.

‘Lee Hyun-woo…’

He remembered the time when Kim Tae-hyun had come to him, saying he wanted to expand into Japan.

He mentioned leveraging portal sites and online shopping to bring in 【Jungle】 and 【Software Bank】.

Later, Kim Ah-young also came to him with the same story, but the content was slightly different.

Specifically, it was Lee Hyun-woo of 【Jungle】 who was leading the expansion into Japan.

Since then, he had taken note of Lee Hyun-woo and thought highly of him as he frequently appeared in the media.

In fact, with American and Japanese investors showing interest and the next-generation information technology academic and research institutions focusing on him, it was impossible not to pay attention to the young CEO of 【Jungle】.

‘But my son, who has no friends, is close with Lee Hyun-woo?’

Looking at his son’s face again, Kim Sung-moo began to feel more curious about Lee Hyun-woo.
