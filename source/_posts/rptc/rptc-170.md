Originally, household discipline was typically handled by the mother or the eldest child rather than the head of the house.

Today, Kim Tae-hyun took the initiative.

"I'll take you to school."

Instead of a driver, he grabbed the steering wheel himself to drive Kim Na-yoon to school, and soon after departing, he began to admonish her.

"How long are you going to keep up with that blog?"

"What do you mean, how long?"

"If you keep posting photos and responding to everyone’s comments like this, what does that do to our family’s reputation? Try to cut back if possible."

"No."

"Aren't you over your teenage rebellion yet?"

"I don’t even remember when it started, but you weren't there for me during the hardest times, oppa."

"Wow, your attitude… No wonder your two unnie have given up on you."

Originally, Kim Tae-hyun had planned to leave the disciplining to Kim Ah-young or Kim Ah-jin.

Both of them said they couldn't do it.

So he stepped in himself, but as expected, the youngest sister wouldn’t listen.

"If you stop posting photos on your blog, I'll buy you whatever you want."

"If you turn a blind eye to me continuing to post photos, I’ll buy you what you want later, oppa."

"You little…"

"Don’t try to convince me. I’m really enjoying relieving my stress right now. If you try to forcibly stop my hobby, I’ll show you the true end of teenage rebellion."

Her threats were diverse.

It was very fitting for her age,

‘This is just… completely unreasonable.’

He understood why the two older sisters had given up.

Eventually, after dropping her off at school and heading to work, Kim Tae-hyun contacted Lee Hyun-woo.

He had already grasped the situation fairly well and intended to talk it over calmly.

However,

Beep beep beep beep.

Whenever it was frustrating, it was always like this, a busy signal.

It was the same the second time,

‘Who is he talking to so long?’

While he was inwardly grumbling about Lee Hyun-woo not answering the phone, a text came just as he was about to try a third time.

- Oppa, I’ll talk to Hyun-woo.

It was Kim Ah-young.

He snorted as soon as he finished reading.

‘As if you could talk him into it.’

Hadn't she already tried?

The fact that there was no change in Kim Na-yoon meant that Lee Hyun-woo hadn’t been swayed by her words.

However, since his sister was asking like this, Kim Tae-hyun decided to give her one more chance.

- Okay, got it.

He sent the text and put down the phone.

‘Anyway, we’re going to the alumni meeting together next week.’

If there was no change by then, it wouldn’t be too late to meet Lee Hyun-woo in person and talk.

* * *

At that time, Lee Hyun-woo was on the phone with Joe Murphy of 【Jungle USA】.

This was the reason for the busy signal.

Joe Murphy was engrossed in bragging about how well things were going.

(I bet 【Yahoo】 is really on edge. Our search share has surged right up to their heels.)

“Is that so?”

He would respond, but unless it was a fact, he wouldn’t believe it.

‘Not yet. Humans don’t easily leave familiar places.’

Even if the store next door gets significantly better items, it takes time to start peeking over.

And even if they visit by chance, it takes more time to become regulars.

“By the way, when is the blog service going to be launched?”

(Ah, you mean the SNS you mentioned last time. I have to ask the tech team about that.)

There were still many contents not yet introduced in 【Jungle USA】.

The blog was one of them.

Considering the spread speed in Korea, there were expectations for the US too, but it seemed to need more time.

Also, no matter how much Joe Murphy was the CEO, he couldn’t be more knowledgeable about tech than the CTO, Tim Connor.

However, he was confident about the financial side.

(Oh, the calculations for the second quarter profit are almost done, and it looks promising.)

It wasn’t even the end of June yet, but it seemed they had already started calculating the consolidated profit.

“What if you get disappointed by setting such high expectations?”

(I'm telling you to expect it, taking that into account.)

Is the US market really that big?

Joe Murphy’s statement was giving him a sense of anticipation.

But like a roller coaster, he immediately delivered some bad news.

(And also… this will become known soon, so I’m telling you in advance.)

“……”

(The movement to withdraw funds invested in Asia from Wall Street is growing.)

Lee Hyun-woo’s eyes sparkled.

The foreign exchange crisis he hoped wouldn’t come seemed to be showing signs after all.

(Especially, it seems the money invested in Thailand will be pulled out soon. If you were planning to expand there, it might be wise to hold off for now.)

“Thanks for the valuable information.”

(You sound so calm, it feels like you already knew.)

“No, this is the first time I’ve heard it. It’s just that I don’t get surprised easily. Anyway, take care, and let’s stay in touch.”

(Yes, have a good day.)

As he hung up, Lee Hyun-woo’s mind became a bit complicated.

Since there hadn’t been a major crisis until now, he thought maybe he’d get through this life without one,

‘It was just coming a bit late.’

The epicenter being Thailand was the same as in his past life.

Should he start preparing his mind?

‘Thinking an economic crisis wouldn’t happen at all is just a fantasy.’

Once a foreign exchange crisis hit Thailand, it would quickly spread to neighboring countries.

Although the situation was better than before, it wouldn’t be without impact on Korea, which he disliked.

One of his goals in this life was not to watch the same reruns.

Especially, why watch bad reruns?

‘This won’t do. I need to use Nostradamus’s blog for the first time in a while.’

Lee Hyun-woo immediately posted on Nostradamus’s blog.

The title was,

<Thailand, Will Financial Instability Expand Due to Lax Management and Lack of Supervisory Functions at Financial Institutions?>

The content listed the future developments based on what Joe Murphy had mentioned.

- The instability of the national currency (通貨) will lead to a rush towards foreign currency or real estate.

- Naturally, a bubble will form in the real estate market in Thailand.

- The real estate bubble will cause asset inflation and lead to an overall economic bubble.

- To prevent this, the state will intervene in the real estate market, and financial authorities will abandon the fixed exchange rate system, leading to the appreciation of the baht.

- The real estate bubble will start to burst.

- There will be doubts about the repayment ability of companies and individuals who invested in real estate.

- Financial institutions will reduce loans and recover funds, fearing a sharp increase in non-performing loans.

- Meanwhile, the appreciation of the baht will cause a loss of export competitiveness.

- Naturally, the insolvency of companies and individuals will begin, leading to a series of defaults and bankruptcies.

- Due to this financial instability, the value of the baht will plummet.

- Inevitably, a world where the dollar is king will arrive.

Lee Hyun-woo stopped writing around here and read what he had written.

‘Reading it, it sounds just like our country.’

He could only hope someone would read this and make an appropriate judgment.

Especially, he hoped the media, which was very interested in Nostradamus’s blog, would extensively report on the situation in Thailand.

In his past life, ordinary people, companies, and even conglomerates were insensitive to international finance.

It would probably be similar in this life too.

* * *

In the evening, Kim Ah-young came over.

Somehow, the paparazzi who had been following the two of them around had disappeared, and her visits became more frequent.

But her face was full of things she wanted to say.

‘The atmosphere at home due to Na-yoon’s actions is written all over her face.’

Since it was expected, Lee Hyun-woo spoke first.

“Don’t worry too much about Na-yoon.”

“Huh? Oh… of course, I’m not worried. It seems she’s relieving stress through her blog.”

“But your parents and Tae-hyun hyung don’t like it, right?”

“Well… yeah…”

“Then, I’ll meet hyung and explain it directly.”

“What? No, there’s no need for that. I’ll talk to him well in the middle.”

“No, I think it’s better if I do it.”

“What… what are you going to do?”

“Have you heard this saying?”

“……”

“An issue is covered by another issue!”

“What does that even mean?”

“I’ll make Na-yoon’s matter a non-issue… In other words, don’t worry. Got it?”

Kim Ah-young nodded.

There was only one thing she was worried about.

That Lee Hyun-woo would get on the bad side of her parents and oppa.

This would definitely hinder the progress of their relationship.

However, noticing her expression, Lee Hyun-woo finally drew his sword.

He picked up his phone and dialed Kim Tae-hyun’s number.

And as Kim Ah-young tilted her head, not knowing whom he was calling, Kim Tae-hyun’s voice came through.

(Hello?)

“Hello? Tae-hyun hyung?”

(Oh, hey. I was just calling earlier.)

“Really? I didn’t notice. Maybe you should make a good phone for me, hyung. One with caller ID and call waiting technology so I don’t miss your calls.”

(What are you talking about?)

“Haha, just joking. I’m a bit silly, aren’t I?”

(You really are silly. Anyway, you seem really busy these days. Seeing you always on calls, business must be going well.)

“Not bad. Actually, I got a call from the US earlier.”

(The US? You mean 【Jungle USA】?)

“Yes, I was talking with Joe Murphy, the representative there.”

Lee Hyun-woo slowly brought up an issue to cover Kim Na-yoon’s.

‘As far as I know, 【Guseong】 was in the middle of building a factory in Thailand around this time.’

In his past life, it was related to their expansion into the automotive industry with equipment investments.

Due to labor costs, some items were manufactured in Southeast Asia, one of which was Thailand.

But in this life, everything got messed up.

They had been investing in various other things with the money meant for the automotive sector.

However, they hadn’t sold off the land they had pre-purchased in Thailand, so he subtly tossed out the bait.

“Thailand’s situation isn’t looking good.”

(What do you mean by that?)

“To put it simply, the financial instability in Thailand is about to burst the real estate bubble.”

(What? Is that true?)

“Joe Murphy said so. You may or may not know, but he used to work at 【Natural Standard Fund】.”

At that, Kim Ah-young mouthed the words.

‘My oppa knows.’

Sure enough, Joe Murphy was known as a legendary fund manager at that company.

Whether he knew it from before or learned it later, there was no way he wouldn’t know.

(Of course, if Joe Murphy said it, it’s credible. He should be well-informed, right?)

“I suppose so.”

(Where are you now? Can you spare a moment?)

“Sure, I’m near the company. Come on over.”

He planned to explain kindly and cover the issue with another.

Thinking this inwardly, Lee Hyun-woo hung up the phone.

Then he smiled warmly at Kim Ah-young.

“How’s that? With this, they won’t be able to focus on Na-yoon’s matter. Right?”

Kim Ah-young nodded.
