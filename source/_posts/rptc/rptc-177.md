Lee Jung-yong, Lee Hyun-woo's father, also has extensive business experience.

Lee Hyun-woo thought that if it hadn't been for the IMF in his previous life, his father would have managed well on his own.

"With the experience you've accumulated and a son who has returned, you should soar in this life."

Lee Hyun-woo wanted to do his best to help because of the dream his father had mentioned last time.

Fortunately, his father, Lee Jung-yong, didn't refuse his help.

"Then my immediate task is to look into getting a spot in a department store. And also to open stores in Myeong-dong and Gangnam. That way, once we sign a contract with 【GAPE】 and establish a joint venture, several stores can launch right away."

"Right?"

He's good at prioritizing what needs to be done.

And he's good at organizing as well.

"Great. You negotiate with 【GAPE】 in the U.S., and while Hwan does market research for design, I'll secure the logistics and sales network. Does that sound right?"

"Yes, and we might need some funds."

"I have some saved up. Plus, there's the money you gave me when you adjusted the shares last time."

In fact, 【Jungle】 had started 100% with his father's money.

Even between parents and children, he thought they should be clear about finances, so he converted his father's initial investment into shares.

When they calculated it at the end of last year, it was a staggering amount.

It was clear that his father had been preparing for this business using that as capital.

"Honestly, I don't know exactly how much money my father has."

Even after returning, when he asked his father to invest, he gave it after some consideration.

Of course, he had never disclosed exactly how much was originally in his account.

If additional help was needed, Lee Hyun-woo thought he would assist this time.

"I think I can handle the stores and logistics, so proceed without worry."

"Okay, I'll let you know once the date for the U.S. trip is set."

Amid the joy, a goal came to mind.

To be precise, it was a conflict of the goals he had.

"But what about my work-life balance?"

It wasn't easy to balance helping his father's work with having evenings to himself.

With both 【Jungle】 and his father's work to handle, it required double the effort.

Fortunately, 【Jungle】 was already on track, so it ran smoothly even without Lee Hyun-woo's constant supervision.

"So, I think I should help with my father's business now."

If he laid a good foundation for his father's business like he did for 【Jungle】, it would run well on its own later.

Ultimately, the goal of being a filial son clashed with work-life balance, but only for a while.

Rationalizing himself once more, Lee Hyun-woo moved busily that day as well.

Naturally, he often communicated with Joe Murphy and, after finally talking to 【GAPE】, set the date for the end of the month.

When he informed his father of this at night,

"You should get your visa in the meantime."

"Thanks to you, I get to visit the U.S. too."

More than the fact that he was going to the U.S., Lee Hyun-woo felt excited because his father seemed thrilled to finally realize his dream.

Lee Hyun-woo felt the same way.

"Can I finally help my father realize his dream?"

Of course, he couldn't take the business lightly, but Lee Hyun-woo saw a certain level of success.

Having a son as a cheat key, it would be more bizarre to fail.

"Have I now created a win-win foundation?"

The win-win he thought of.

It meant good results for his father, himself, and Kim Ah-young.

The part where it was good for him held a slightly special meaning.

Somehow, he wanted to see the failed SPA from his previous life bloom brilliantly this time.

Although if it succeeded, it would be known as his father's achievement,

"I feel like I'll get vicarious satisfaction."

This triggered Lee Hyun-woo's workaholic instinct again.

* * *

Meanwhile, Kim Ah-young, after a day of anxious contemplation, finally called Lee Jung-woo.

(Hello?)

"It's me, Jung-woo."

(Oh, sister-in-law!)

"I was curious if everything was okay."

(You mean if my brother knows?)

"Yes, that's right."

(Of course, he noticed everything. Though he seems dull, my brother is someone who has a sly fox inside him.)

"Oh... as expected..."

She had realized it after seeing Lee Hyun-woo's eyes the previous day.

Still, she had many worries and didn't ask, but everything was eventually revealed.

"How is Hyun-woo feeling?"

(He seems very pleased.)

"Really? Is that true?"

(You might not know this about my brother, but although people often say he lacks depth, he understands very well why others do what they do. He quickly realized that you were considering his father's company and actively jumped in.)

"How so?"

(Do you know the brand 【GAPE】 in the U.S.?)

"Yes, I know it."

(It seems our father's company will partner with them for domestic distribution and sales.)

"Really?"

(Yes, my brother went to our father's company today and laid out a very detailed plan. It seems a designer helping our father will conduct market research to slightly modify and supplement 【GAPE】's design to suit Koreans.)

"Oh..."

(And my brother will go to the U.S. to negotiate with 【GAPE】, while our father looks into department stores or direct stores. You know my brother; once he sets a plan, he moves very quickly, so it seems he's already set the date to go to the U.S.)

As Lee Jung-woo mentioned, Kim Ah-young knew Lee Hyun-woo's style well.

She knew for sure that once Lee Hyun-woo got involved, things moved quickly.

"Wow, that's really great."

(Yes, so don't worry too much, and please take good care of my brother. Although he seems fine on the surface, he might be feeling a bit hurt inside.)

Lee Jung-woo, who just said Lee Hyun-woo had no depth, now spoke of his hidden feelings.

Kim Ah-young could only nod at these contradictory words.

"The brothers are similar. They really try to consider others' feelings."

She thought deeply after replying.

"Since it has come to this, I should push forward too."

Determined to roll up her sleeves and help Lee Hyun-woo's father's business, she grabbed the phone again.

The person she decided to call was her aunt.

Of course, it was Chairman Kim Sung-hee, who runs 【New World Department Store】.

(Hello?)

"It's me, aunt."

(Oh? What's the occasion?)

"How have you been?"

(Same as always.)

"I have a favor to ask, and I'd like to meet you tomorrow if you have time."

(Of course, I'll make time if my beloved niece is coming. But what's the favor?)

"I'll tell you tomorrow."

(Okay, see you tomorrow then.)

"Yes, aunt."

* * *

The favor was, of course, to get a store space for Lee Hyun-woo's father's company.

Kim Ah-young planned to ask for good conditions and actually secured that promise from Kim Sung-hee the next day.

With this in mind, she cheerfully headed to 【Jungle】 to meet Lee Hyun-woo around his off-hours.

But as she entered Lee Hyun-woo's office, her heart grew heavy again.

"Am I overstepping?"

A woman's heart can waver like this in just one day.

Especially for Kim Ah-young, a novice in dating, everything was clumsy.

Naturally, she was flustered by Lee Hyun-woo's next words as soon as she entered.

"I've figured out what conspiracy you and my brother have been plotting."

"Oh, that... I'm sorry..."

"Why apologize? I'm grateful. You knew my goal was to be a filial son and helped, didn't you?"

"Yes, but I was worried I might have upset you."

At Kim Ah-young's words, Lee Hyun-woo smiled broadly.

"To say it's completely untrue would be a lie, but other things made me feel good and overshadowed it all."

What could the other things be?

Kim Ah-young guessed subtly.

"Could it be... he realized I like him more?"

If not, he'd be a fool.

Despite Park Min-sook's constant warnings, Kim Ah-young, a novice in dating, could never hide her feelings for Lee Hyun-woo.

Even now, it's the same.

"I'm feeling a bit self-conscious."

"Huh? Why?"

"Am I the only one nervous? Are you completely at ease?"

"No way. I also jumped into my father's work actively because of it."

"Really?"

"Yes, because I understood clearly what you and my brother were thinking."

"Then there's one more thing I've been hiding. Will you forgive me?"

"Of course, what is it?"

"I asked my aunt to secure a store space for your father's company. And with good conditions."

"Wow... did you talk to my brother about 【GAPE】 again?"

"Well... somehow, it happened."

"There was an internal spy in the family. All the information leaked out."

Lee Hyun-woo shook his head as if he couldn't believe it.

"Honestly, in my previous life, I might have felt inferior or hurt my pride."

So what had changed for Lee Hyun-woo now?

Having lived over 50 years, he couldn't not know.

Marriage is a union of families, and no matter how good 【Guseong】 is, it could make his parents uncomfortable.

Moreover, in his previous life, Lee Hyun-woo would have felt very burdened about his uncertain future with Kim Ah-young.

But now?

"In a few years, 【Jungle】 will grow to be a company equal to 【Guseong】."

With such a clear answer, why be anxious?

So he smiled and said,

"While we're at it, I should ask Seon-hwa for help too."

"Oh, right. There's 【Aejeong Department Store】 too?"

"Yes, and once we get into those two, will other department stores stand still?"

"Absolutely not. 【LO Department Store】, a rival of my aunt's, would definitely take it."

"Wow, my father's company will grow rapidly."

"I'm excited."

"Me too."

Lee Hyun-woo thought about introducing Kim Ah-young to his parents around that time.

"How long will it take?"

Hopefully, within this year.

* * *

At that time, Kim Sung-hee also visited her brother after a long time.

And she said,

"Ah-young is really clever, brother."

"Did something happen?"

"Something did, but she asked me to keep it a secret from you, so I can't say anything."

"Well, that's pointless. Why bring it up then?"

"Just think of it as something related to Lee Hyun-woo."

"Hyun-woo? Why him?"

"Since it's a secret, don't pry too much. Instead, you should keep an eye on CEO Lee."

"What do you mean by keeping an eye on Hyun-woo?"

"Many people are eyeing him as a prospective son-in-law. Recently, even the chairman of 【Aejeong Department Store】 visited. She seemed to think her daughter is dating CEO Lee or something."

"That's nonsense."

"Yes, so I firmly denied it. But from that one incident, I realized something. Even if CEO Lee does nothing, girls will keep flocking around him. And if it makes the news, it'll be a big fuss."

"......"

"So I'm saying you should keep a close watch on him. I came to see you to tell you this."
