Lee Hyun-woo, who is interested in the value of life beyond just money and success, became interested in the 【Internet Art Gallery】.

Hwang Man's explanation can be summarized as follows:

First, the basic concept of the 【Internet Art Gallery】 is similar to 【Jungle】's auction system. In other words, it facilitates the trading of artworks through auctions and earns a commission in the process.

Second, the promotional efforts also make extensive use of 【Jungle】's blog. Unexpectedly, they found a significant demand from people who are quite interested in artworks.

Third, for supply, they persuade senior and mid-level domestic artists to symbolically display some of their works online.

Fourth, however, the purpose of this site is the popularization of artworks. The goal is to provide emotional richness to the middle class, who have been focused solely on making a living and have struggled through midlife. Therefore, the focus is more on mid-to-low priced artworks rather than high-priced ones.

Fifth, this can create a virtuous cycle. As everyone knows, being an artist is a financially challenging profession. However, with a stable supply of artwork, artists can generate income and continue their creative activities, leading to an improved quality of life compared to the past.

Lee Hyun-woo unconsciously nodded at Hwang Man's last explanation.

- Ring ring ring ring

If it weren't for the ringing of his cell phone, he would have wanted to encourage Hwang Man with an excited voice.

"Please, don't mind me and take the call."

"Alright, then, excuse me for a moment."

When he answered the phone, a half-familiar voice came through.

(Oppa, it's me.)

It was Kim Ah-jin.

"Oh…."

(Have you been well?)

"Yes, Ah-jin, have you been well too?"

(Thanks to you. Ah, are you free for lunch tomorrow by any chance?)

"Lunch tomorrow? Well, I don't have any particular plans."

(That's great. Then please give me the honor of treating you to lunch tomorrow.)

Lee Hyun-woo had a rough idea why Kim Ah-jin wanted to meet him tomorrow.

‘She’s finally coming to ask where she should invest.’

Unlike her siblings, Kim Ah-jin seemed to depend entirely on Lee Hyun-woo, so he decided to tell her about the unique sector.

That was the 【Internet Art Gallery】.

‘Maybe it’s perfect for Kim Ah-jin? She used to run an art gallery in a past life.’

If a wealthy investor like Kim Ah-jin partnered with the 【Internet Art Gallery】, it would be quite ideal, and a smile unknowingly formed on his lips.

‘Even if it's not her, it's a site I want to invest in.’

After hanging up the phone, Lee Hyun-woo turned to Hwang Man and spoke.

"After hearing your explanation, the purpose of this site has become very clear. Please make sure to attend the upcoming 21st Century Venture Business Association meeting."

"Ah, yes, I will prepare thoroughly and participate!"

The next day at lunchtime.

Lee Hyun-woo mentioned the name of the site he had learned about the previous day to Kim Ah-jin.

"I happened to find a good place. It's called 【Internet Art Gallery】."

"What? 【Internet Art Gallery】?"

Kim Ah-jin asked Lee Hyun-woo with a somewhat understanding expression of what it might be.

"Is it really a site where you buy and sell artworks online?"

"Exactly."

Lee Hyun-woo was now speaking to her more casually.

After all, she was going to be his sister-in-law someday, and she had begged him to speak more casually.

Because of that, it seemed he could make recommendations more comfortably.

"When do you think artworks will always be traded offline?"

"Well… but artworks generally need to be seen before buying, so it seems difficult to trade them online."

Although Kim Ah-jin majored in design, she was also deeply knowledgeable about art.

She liked artworks so much that she would later run an art gallery.

To such a person, Lee Hyun-woo spoke firmly.

"It's a prejudice."

"A prejudice?"

"Your company's fashion mall has been doing well recently, right? And the clothes sold there are much more expensive than the ones our company sells. Why is that?"

"Well… it’s because the brand name 【First Wool】 gives consumers a sense of trust. And to be precise, it’s not that it’s doing better. I heard the scale of clothes sold at 【Jungle Shopping】 is enormous."

"What I mean is that your company's fashion mall makes bigger profits even by selling just one piece of clothing. Anyway, you just said that the trust that the brand gives has an impact online."

"Yes… but so what?"

"Then what if the 【Internet Art Gallery】 only sells artworks guaranteed by trusted artists?"

"Really? Do they sell like that?"

"I don't know."

"What?"

"But an investor can suggest that. And the person who created that site probably planned it that way."

Kim Ah-jin’s doe-like eyes wavered greatly.

Lee Hyun-woo’s words sounded plausible to her.

"But… the reason I'm investing this time is to get the maximum return on investment…."

"Then you’ve got it wrong. I'm not a god, how would I know that? You should ask an investment expert at 【Guseong Securities】 for that. Right?"

"……."

"I told your brother and sister the same thing. The stocks I recommend may not be that great. I even told your sister about a company that wants to produce 3D printers."

At this point, Lee Hyun-woo briefly explained 3D printers.

He then told her to confirm with Kim Ah-young, which made Kim Ah-jin sigh.

"Yes, I know about that. And my sister and brother already said they would invest based on their abilities without relying on advice. My father even praised them for that."

"Of course. A crucial skill in management is the ability to foresee future industries. But why don’t you want to do that?"

"Honestly… I don't trust myself. I don't know how you'll see me for saying this, but I've never gone against my parents' wishes even once. That means I've rarely done anything according to my own will. So I thought about it. How about showing my capability by investing in a good company without taking any advice this time?"

"Then? Why did you come?"

"Because the deadline is approaching, and I'm anxious…"

Although they were siblings, their characters were different.

But Lee Hyun-woo understood enough.

He and his brother also had different characters.

‘This young lady is dependent on someone else from start to end.’

Knowing this, he couldn't just step in and help.

She was a gold spoon among gold spoons, born with more advantages than anyone else.

Even though her starting line was different, she had already received help from Lee Hyun-woo, so now she had to prove her ability on her own.

If not, she could invest in the 【Internet Art Gallery】 he mentioned and try to grow a new and unique platform.

"That's all the advice I can give you. I told you this because you’re Ah-young's sister, meaning you’re my girlfriend’s sister, and I chose and told you carefully. And maybe it’s perfect for you. It’s related to your major, and you have a deep understanding of art… isn't it?"

"Yes…"

Her eyes, filled with helplessness, seemed to be pleading.

Was there nothing else?

But Lee Hyun-woo just smiled.

Then he spoke.

"If it goes well later, treat me."

Lee Hyun-woo looked at Kim Ah-jin with eyes full of pride, as if he had done something fulfilling.

* * *

A few days later, the 21st Century Venture Business Association meeting was finally held at Seorabeol Hotel.

And more companies than ever occupied the lobby.

At the forefront, Lee Hyun-woo was greeting investors.

First, Joe Murphy, who hadn't left for the U.S. yet, brought people.

"Welcome."

Lee Hyun-woo already knew that Joe Murphy's party consisted of acquaintances he had made on Wall Street.

‘Foreign big shots will stir things up first.’

The second group was also foreign big shots.

"Long time no see. Hahaha."

Son Jung-yi, and the Japanese investors he brought along.

The third were the so-called underground financiers.

"CEO Lee, have you been well?"

It was none other than Kim Yoon-soo's father, Kim Dong-baek, and the people from the shadows who accompanied him.

The fourth group was from 【Guseong Group】 and 【Aejeong Group】, as well as other chaebol groups who decided to participate after hearing about the involvement of these two.

Even Park Jin-yong, the chairman of 【Samjin Computers】, came and said to Lee Hyun-woo with a fond expression.

"I've seen you in the news a lot lately, but don't just work, take it easy sometimes."

"Yes, Chairman. Hahaha."

After that, public institutions and public enterprises made their appearances.

Looking at these scenes, Lee Hyun-woo felt a sense of disconnection from the previous period of his life.

‘It's hard to even recall the shadow of the foreign exchange crisis.’

Although 【Domipa Department Store】 finally went bankrupt the previous day, today's event felt like it offset that.

‘Hope it goes well.’

Seeing the bustling booths, a gentle smile spread across his face unknowingly.

And then, occasionally, he made eye contact with Kim Ah-young, who was glancing at him.

Her booth was interesting.

【GO to travel】, a site that connects accommodation and flights, which Lee Hyun-woo had recently been paying attention to.

‘Since she manages a hotel, she's interested in that.’

The probability of it leading to an investment was high.

The picture was already forming.

A product combining flight tickets and hotel accommodations being sold on 【GO to travel】.

Meanwhile, Kim Tae-hyun, the eldest son of 【Guseong Group】, was standing for a long time in front of a company called 【GoldenBlue】.

Lee Hyun-woo knew very well what kind of company it was.

‘That's just an advertising site, right?’

In other words, the site was filled with advertisements from the first page to the last, and the surprising thing was that this company had gone public in his previous life.

Its market capitalization was quite high too.

Later, the bubble burst, and it went bankrupt, but if you invested now, you could probably make a profit in the middle.

Lastly, the youngest of 【Guseong Group】, Kim Ah-jin, seemed to be contemplating for a long time in front of the 【Internet Art Gallery】.

‘Honestly, I don’t know if that will succeed in the short term.’

Lee Hyun-woo intended to invest regardless of whether she did, to support Hwang Man, the company’s president.

No, he had already made up his mind irrespective of Kim Ah-jin's investment.

Lee Hyun-woo deeply remembered what Hwang Man had said.

The fundamental purpose of the 【Internet Art Gallery】 was to popularize artworks.

He wanted to bring emotional richness to the lives of people who had been focused solely on making a living.

‘I used to live like that in my past life.’

In this life, he was trying to place value on other things, but it wasn't easy.

Of course, there was no giving up.

He would buy artworks to display in his home for emotional richness.

‘I’ll definitely buy something when the site opens.’

While thinking this, someone tapped him on the back.

Turning around, it was Kim Na-yoon, the youngest of 【Guseong】.

"Oh? You came too?"

"Yes, just now."

"Are you here to invest too?"

"I'm here to look around, but there's one place I like."

"What is it?"

"That…"

Lee Hyun-woo chuckled at what she pointed to.

The booth she pointed to was a site for trading second-hand luxury goods.

"Well, that's not bad."

Today, Lee Hyun-woo felt one thing for sure.

The world is vast, and truly diverse platforms can be born.

‘Next time, should I invite venture companies from around the world to Korea and open a market?’
