Recently, the place that has been receiving the most attention in the Korean economy is 【Jungle】.

In particular, the interest from journalists was tremendous, as evidenced by the huge number gathered at the airport.

Before Lee Hyun-woo appeared, their conversation was quite interesting.

"It seems like the days we can approach Lee Hyun-woo are numbered."

"Yeah, right. I think they'll start assigning bodyguards soon."

"They already have bodyguards, though not hired by 【Jungle】."

This remark naturally shifted the topic of conversation.

"That's true. For a while, the bodyguards from 【Guseong】 have been doing a good job."

"We should have realized it then—that the two were already dating."

"Many people here already noticed, but no one dared to confirm it."

"Can't we confirm it now? Our desk said they won't particularly prevent it."

"Same here."

"Us too."

"So, it means 【Guseong】 won't intervene."

"To write a bit of a novel, it's probably because 【Guseong】 doesn't feel the need to intervene anymore. 【Jungle】's status has drastically changed from before."

"Indeed. In the past, being the eldest daughter of 【Guseong】 was a huge advantage, but now it's almost even or even about to be reversed."

"The news about 【Yaho】 adopting 【Jungle】's search engine was huge."

"Even without that, think about Lee Hyun-woo himself. Was there ever anyone like him in Korea? Most founders of conglomerates grew along with the development of their era, but Lee Hyun-woo isn't like that. In an already established economic world, he is boldly self-made."

"Is it just about being self-made? He's also supporting other companies in the information and communication sector. Actually, that sounds a bit off. It would be more fitting to say he's been cultivating the field to plant seeds."

"That's why 【Guseong】 didn't need to block it. If anything, they might advertise it."

"You've heard that too, huh? Gangnam matchmakers are all excited about Lee Hyun-woo."

"Hey, that story is already outdated. Since Lee Hyun-woo is taken, they're aiming for his younger brother, Lee Jung-woo."

"Not just Lee Jung-woo, though. All of the key founding members of 【Jungle】 are single. Starting with COO Woo Sang-won, CTO Jang Yoo-chul, and another CTO Oh Min-woo."

"I even heard that Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho, heads of sales and marketing, are top-tier groom candidates."

"Damn, why does my stomach hurt? I graduated from a better university than them."

"That's an old-fashioned thing to say. Hey, because of 【Jungle】, there's a new trend of 'education doesn't matter.' That company even hires high school graduates. So, what's the big deal about academic background? All that matters is showing your capabilities in a company like 【Jungle】."

"That's right, that's right. Not just 【Jungle】, but even companies like 【One Computer】 and 【Alpha Cast】 don't have people with outstanding academic backgrounds. Same with 【Someone's Story】."

This is proof that Korea has fully entered the information age.

Now, it's not just about 【Jungle】.

Recently, two other companies have also been standing out.

Each for their MP3 players and communication equipment.

A short while ago, both companies entered the Japanese market simultaneously.

There are also rumors that they are negotiating in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Hence, some journalists called these three companies ‘JOA’ from their initials, which in Korean sounds like "joa" (meaning "to like").

"To write another novel, I'm looking forward to the battle between the old and the new. It seems like it will be a key point to watch."

"By the battle between the old and the new, you mean the current conglomerates and emerging venture companies like ‘JOA’?"

"Exactly. Personally, I think the latter will do better. Right now, it's only ‘JOA,’ but companies like 【Someone's Story】, 【Ghost】, 【Type Soft】, and 【Internet Goblin Market】 are growing rapidly too."

"Yes. On the other hand, the conglomerates are shaking massively recently. After the bankruptcy of 【DoMiPa Department Store】, there are many rumors about who will be next."

"Ugh, let's keep that talk to a minimum. Hearing about company failures here and there makes me feel depressed."

"There are indeed many people suffering from depression. It’s been more than just one or two companies this year."

"I'm worried that we might end up like Thailand."

"Hey, can you really compare Thailand and Korea? It won't be that bad."

"No. If you read Nostradamus's prophecies, it's quite worrisome."

"Alright, alright. Let's talk about something pleasant."

"Why only talk about good things? You need to look at both sides objectively. Personally, I believe this is a transitional period. One side is disintegrating, and the other is being created."

"And since it is balanced so intricately, let's agree that there won't be a situation similar to Thailand."

"What the... Oh?"

"Oh? They're coming out!"

"They're coming!"

The chatter was long.

So, when they saw Lee Hyun-woo and his entourage coming out, they were delighted.

But soon their faces were filled with disappointment.

That's because many more bodyguards than before blocked them.

This was at the level of 【Guseong Group】 intervention, and more precisely, Kim Tae-hyun had mobilized them to capture Lee Hyun-woo.

* * *

A little later, in Kim Tae-hyun's car.

Thinking there might be an uncomfortable conversation, he put Kim Ah-young in another car and sat Lee Hyun-woo next to him.

"Why are you suddenly rushing?"

A question missing where to, what for, and with whom.

Lee Hyun-woo understood instantly.

Public dating.

"Did exposing my private life cause any damage to you, hyung?"

"A lot. What I dislike the most is that because of you, I might have to get married earlier."

"Oh, sorry about that."

Now, Lee Hyun-woo could understand the displeased face of Kim Tae-hyun, who had come to meet him.

"Is there anything else you don't like?"

"The world keeps comparing you and me. I try not to be conscious of it, but it's hard not to."

"Hahaha."

"Don't laugh, it's annoying."

"I can't help but laugh because I like your straightforwardness, hyung. And since I'll need more affection in the future, it's welcome if we get closer now."

"Anyway, you talk really well. If there were any gaps, you’d exploit them."

"Surprisingly, I have my shortcomings."

"Then show me."

"I already told you I have shortcomings. You should find and exploit them and take advantage of my weaknesses."

"Why go as far as finding weaknesses? I already have a few. You're like Nostradamus. Without me, you can't build a data center immediately. And most importantly, you'll be my junior."

"Listening to you, I realize I'm the weaker one. You must be happy, hyung. But having a junior like me would be reassuring, wouldn't it?"

"Half of it, yes."

"What about the other half?"

"It feels burdensome. The world will keep comparing us because you're more successful."

"No matter what, you'd be compared to others anyway. You have a cousin from 【New World Group】 too, don't you?"

"That's right. He was always a comparison target too. But not as much as you."

In Kim Tae-hyun's voice, there was an unreserved acknowledgment of Lee Hyun-woo.

Essentially, he was saying he was great, and the only person comparable to him was Lee Hyun-woo.

Lee Hyun-woo couldn't help but smile at this amusing thought.

"By the way, what's the exact reason you came to get me? It feels like we're having a meaningless conversation."

"A meaningful relationship often involves a lot of meaningless conversations. We'll be meeting for that purpose from now on."

"Now that you mention it, that seems true."

"In that sense, come over for the upcoming Chuseok. Father and Mother want to see you."

"Ah, so this was the purpose. Inviting me for Chuseok."

"That's right. While we're at it, I also want to hear about how things went in Taiwan and Hong Kong."

"Didn't our media cover it well? These days, there are so many places trying to make my life difficult."

"Is that why you declared public dating?"

"No. It's because it seemed unfair to Ah-young."

"Unfair in what way?"

"Qualifications?"

Hearing that, Kim Tae-hyun's eyes twitched.

Though he mentioned Kim Ah-young, he was actually talking about 【Guseong】, specifically, Kim Tae-hyun and his father.

In other words, he was saying he wasn't unqualified to be Kim Ah-young's partner.

"Qualifications were met long ago. At least, that's what I think."

"Thank you."

"Then let me ask again. Are most of the news reports true?"

"If you're referring to the news about 【Yaho】, it's 100% true."

"Phew, this is really something. 【Jungle】's technology must be amazing."

"Consider yourself lucky. We're developing an operating system for 【Guseong】's PDA phones with this technology."

"I indeed consider that fortunate. Even before that, with the MP3 phones."

"Oh, right. How are they doing? Selling well?"

"It's unbelievable. Moreover, we made a few more of the color phones you gave me and distributed them. Now, people who didn't receive them are contacting us, asking how much they can buy them for."

He didn't mention where they were distributed, but it was unnecessary.

Just one of the social clubs Kim Tae-hyun knew would ensure all its members wanted one.

"That's impressive."

"Thanks to you. I honestly admit it. In terms of strategy, you are far superior to me."

"You're flattering me."

"No, I'm saying it without the extra praise I want to give. But don't get too proud. I've also started putting in effort recently."

Does that mean he hadn't before?

Though unclear, it seems his inherent talents will make him much better than in the past, where he had a privileged background.

No matter what, Lee Hyun-woo could see through his thoughts.

It couldn't be helped.

Lee Hyun-woo seemed to have lived a long life, so how could Kim Tae-hyun, barely in his thirties, hide anything from him?

On the contrary, realizing he couldn't hide it, he deliberately exposed many parts today.

"Yes. By showing your abilities like this, you'll be properly treated as a successor later."

That's why he was the center of controversy in his past life.

Hopefully, in this life, he will be recognized as qualified and rise as a key executive in 【Guseong】.

* * *

After meeting Kim Tae-hyun, the next task was his parents.

As soon as Lee Hyun-woo entered the house, seeing the prepared table, he realized.

His parents wanted to hear his explanation or clarification.

A little later, with a calm expression, he picked up his spoon and said,

"You know whose daughter Ah-young is, right? I'm sorry for hiding it all this time."

"You two are alike."

"Indeed, why do you both apologize so much."

"What? What do you mean..."

"Ah-young called just a while ago."

"Oh, she kept apologizing for hiding it."

"And she said she would come and greet us this Chuseok."

"But I'm worried if it's okay with so many relatives coming this Chuseok."

For a moment, Lee Hyun-woo's eyes widened.

At the same time, a thought occurred.

'I really am dating a wonderful woman.'
