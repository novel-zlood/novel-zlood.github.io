The basics of sales are to get out there once you have the answer.

However, you can't just run around blindly.

Of course, you need to devise a strategy.

"Mr. Han Se-jin, I think you need to find out about the performances we can integrate immediately."

"Yes, I'll look into it right away."

"You know the age group, right?"

"Teenagers and twenty-somethings... singers that they would like, right?"

"That's right."

In this era, while there is an internet population in their 30s, teenagers and twenty-somethings are overwhelmingly more.

This applies not only to concerts but also to movies, plays, and sports games.

'Maybe we can do direct purchases?'

Until now, the company hadn't considered direct purchases because it didn't have a warehouse to store products, which involves buying directly, leaving a margin, and then selling.

Originally, direct purchases were the core growth strategy of 【Amazoness】.

The problem was the storage warehouse and logistics costs for transportation.

Initially, 【Amazoness】 incurred huge deficits here but covered them through investments and eventually monopolized the market.

If 【Jungle】 wants to follow that, it needs to bear deficits and attract investments, but Lee Hyun-woo's current stance is 'self-sustained growth.'

Therefore, he planned to start direct purchases after accumulating more capital.

'Yes, it's time to start.'

Fortunately, tickets don't require a large warehouse, so they can be bought in bulk and sold online.

As his thoughts connected, he wondered if the same could be applied to records.

A small office space could easily store tapes or CDs.

'Let's take it step by step.'

So, when Lee Hyun-woo heard the information Han Se-jin had gathered shortly after,

"There is a Shin Sung-hoon concert coming up soon."

he immediately gave this instruction.

"Can you contact Shin Sung-hoon's agency and tell them that 【Jungle】 would like to promote the concert?"

"Oh? That's a good idea."

"Emphasize that we'll do it for free and suggest a meeting because of this."

【Jungle】 grew as the PC communication population flowed in.

And PC communication was still active, centered around clubs.

Could a singer who values fans ignore an online fan club-like community?

When Lee Hyun-woo explained this to Han Se-jin, he reported back by the end of the day,

"【Nine Sound】 wants to meet tomorrow."

【Nine Sound】, which Han Se-jin mentioned, was a big agency in 1996, housing stars like Shin Sung-hoon and Kim Geun-mo.

While they might peak and decline when the idol era comes, breaking through this place now was significant.

Thus, the next morning, Lee Hyun-woo and Han Se-jin visited 【Nine Sound】.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Hong Dong-wook, the PR team leader at Nine Sound."

"I'm Lee Hyun-woo, the CEO of 【Jungle】 Software, and this is Han Se-jin, who handles sales. He will often come to 【Nine Sound】 on my behalf."

Talking about 'next time' even when the other party isn't considering it shows confidence.

Lee Hyun-woo spent the initial time praising 【Nine Sound】 for nurturing Shin Sung-hoon and Kim Geun-mo.

Then, as the atmosphere ripened, he slowly brought up the main topic.

"We hope Shin Sung-hoon's concert gets more promotion through 【Jungle】."

"I'm glad to learn about this method using the internet. Moreover, it's great that there are no promotional costs."

"It's just putting up a window. Ah, while we're at it, how about selling some concert tickets online?"

Originally, the purpose was to promote the concert, but Lee Hyun-woo subtly started the inclusion process.

Hong Dong-wook showed an interested expression.

Although not the entire quantity, he responded positively, thinking it might be worth trying for a part.

"I'll have to propose it to the higher-ups, but it sounds good. But can you explain the exact method? I need to explain it well."

"It's simple. You give us the tickets in advance, and we collect money from those who want to buy them online. Then we send them by mail."

"That's really simple."

"By selling them online, you can eliminate the inconvenience for fans lining up to buy tickets and the hassle or labor costs of setting up multiple booths to sell tickets."

"Wow, that sounds good just listening to it. People are really quick-witted these days. Anyway, I'll take responsibility for pushing this forward."

Seeing Hong Dong-wook’s half-convinced expression, Lee Hyun-woo smiled inwardly.

As they left, Han Se-jin's face showed admiration.

Seeing this, Lee Hyun-woo said,

"How is it? We can do this in other places too, right?"

"Yes, I'll give it a try. And thank you and I'm sorry."

"For what?"

"Thank you for teaching me everything from the beginning to the end, and I'm sorry because I feel like I'm not doing much."

Lee Hyun-woo smiled gently again.

Seeing Han Se-jin reminded him of his early days.

He also learned by following his seniors like this.

And later, he taught someone else in the same way.

Or rather, he taught an upgraded version by adding some applications.

So, for Han Se-jin, he looks forward to the future, not the present.

He hopes Han Se-jin will teach his juniors well with his own methods.

Of course, this was just his thoughts, and what came out of his mouth was different.

"Since you've learned, you should be put into practice now, right?"

"Yes, I'll give it a try from now on."

Lee Hyun-woo nodded at Han Se-jin's enthusiastic look.

And he thought that as long as they didn't deviate much from his method, they could expand 【Jungle】's territory by approaching it like today.

* * *

A little later, Lee Hyun-woo returned to the company.

And he informed them about the discussions with 【Nine Sound】 regarding Shin Sung-hoon's concert.

"Can you create an event window now?"

"I can do it with my eyes closed now."

Lee Jung-woo jokingly accepted Lee Hyun-woo's instruction.

But contrary to his boastful words, when he actually starts working, he shows terrifying concentration.

It might be a characteristic of siblings sharing the same genes.

The absorption rate is also fast.

Although he lacked design sense, the event windows he created after listening to Yoo Jin-young were much better than before.

That evening, good news came from 【Nine Sound】.

(The higher-ups have approved it. Please sell 200 pre-sale tickets online.)

The main hall of the Central Culture Center, where the concert would be held, had about 4,000 seats.

It was less than he thought, which was disappointing, but Lee Hyun-woo understood as there might be other distribution-related relationships.

'The beginning is half the battle. Don't be disappointed.'

The next day, a satisfactory event window was prepared,

"Shall we put it up right away?"

"Okay."

They started the event, including the pre-sale ticket announcement.

Perhaps as a sign that the system was being established, seeing this, Han Se-jin was fired up with enthusiasm.

"I'm going out to find new concerts."

"Alright then. Please work hard."

"Yes, sir."

Watching Han Se-jin walk out with a notebook in his left hand, no longer keeping it in his pocket, Lee Hyun-woo's face was filled with a bright smile.

'I need to secure a concert soon for his morale.'

Meanwhile, seeing the busy company employees, Yoo Jin-young spoke in a regretful voice.

"It would be nice if we could do double."

Hearing her voice by chance, Lee Hyun-woo's expression turned complicated.

'One of the double members died under mysterious circumstances, whether it was suicide or homicide. Could it be repeated in this life?'

Lee Hyun-woo shook his head.

The history of past lives could repeat in some aspects and differ in others.

Especially in personal matters, he thought the probability of the same thing happening was very low.

Therefore, he believed it was unlikely that one of the double members would face a tragedy this time.

Similarly, the field Lee Hyun-woo was now involved in showed significant signs of change.

Even at the moment, it was evident.

Recently, inquiries about selling through the internet were pouring in, not only from Kim Yoon-soo of 【One Computer】 and Hwang Il-ho, the sales king of Yongsan Electronics Market.

Perhaps because of this, Lee Jung-woo's voice was much brighter at the meeting the next day.

"We started promoting the concert yesterday, and the number of connections has increased again."

"Since celebrities have that much of a ripple effect."

"And we should see that people are spending more time on the website. Then the computer event gets exposed, and this could lead to more sales, so it seems like we're on a good trend."

Shin Sung-hoon is undoubtedly one of the top singers of this era.

Especially with solid support from women in their 20s, as his concert promotion started, PC communication clubs began to enter 【Jungle】.

In fact, to participate in auctions or online shopping at 【Jungle】, one must sign up.

"Not only has the number of connections increased, but the number of subscribers is almost skyrocketing."

"It's really good news from the morning."

"So, I was thinking, how about expanding shopping beyond just computers?"

"For example?"

"Of course, Shin Sung-hoon's albums. They sell a million copies once released, so we can buy them at a reasonable price and sell them a bit cheaper online."

Lee Hyun-woo grinned at his brother's words.

As expected, he wasn't living thoughtlessly.

It was a very positive phenomenon for the whole company.

'The concept of direct purchase, which no one taught, is starting to emerge from the engineer's mouth.'

Moreover, selling now, with exposure effects, could be more effective.

Sensing this instinctively, Lee Jung-woo cautiously suggested again.

"We worried about delivery costs last time, but since we don't run a separate record retail store, we don't have to pay rent or maintenance costs. If we sell a lot, it wouldn't be a loss."

"That doesn't mean we can cover the delivery costs ourselves. Ticket postage isn't much of a loss, but records are different."

"That's true, but I just mentioned it because it seemed like a waste. I was wondering if there was a way."

As Han Se-jin interjected, Lee Jung-woo's voice turned regretful.

Listening to their conversation, Lee Hyun-woo smiled with satisfaction.

'I warmly welcome meetings like this.'

Now that he seemed to be adapting to the company, it was great to see Han Se-jin pointing out issues in Lee Jung-woo's opinions.

Even if a project is led by one person initially, collective intelligence is needed as it progresses.

So, Lee Hyun-woo quickly summarized.

"There might be a way, but it's certain we can't solve it while sitting on these chairs."

"……."

"If the total cost of the record and delivery is cheaper than the retail store, users will surely buy it. The key here is to make the combined price of the record and delivery cost cheaper. It's worth a try. Right?"
