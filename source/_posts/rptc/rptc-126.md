On a Monday morning meeting marking the start of the week, Jang Yoo-cheol spoke with an excited expression.

"Over 2,500 units were sold just yesterday."

Immediately, reactions from other team leaders followed.

"I thought only MP3 files were doing well, but the players are no joke either?"

"Right, at this rate over the weekend, we might sell out the planned 5,000 units in just a few days!"

"What did President Jung say? Can they handle the volume?"

"No, it's not easy right now. They're trying to run two shifts, but they originally estimated 3,000 to 5,000 units per month, which is already more than they initially thought."

The final words from Jang Yoo-cheol were true, bouncing around like a game of ping-pong.

Even when talking with Lee Hyun-woo in the past, Jung Sung-woo had mentioned that the factory was small, initially predicting 1,500 units per month.

After taking Lee Hyun-woo's advice, they expanded the facilities and hired more staff, but mass production still wasn't easy.

Although they were expanding the factory with investments from Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young, it was evident that it would still take some time.

Thus, the team leaders had a look of regret on their faces.

Seeing this, Lee Hyun-woo quickly shifted the mood.

"Alright, alright. One thing is certain, it's booming. Right?"

"That's right. It looks like we'll soon have 'Sold Out' tags."

"Not many products get those tags."

"It's proof that it's selling well."

"And if it sells well, MP3 downloads will increase even faster and more. Eventually, MP3 files will become the norm over tapes and CDs."

"Indeed."

"How about giving one to celebrities during this time? Many people use our Jungle blog."

"Yeah, I've seen celebrities post pictures where ADSL is available."

"Oh? Indirect advertising would be no joke?"

"We could call it sponsorship."

As more ideas came together, advanced marketing strategies poured out.

Lee Hyun-woo, who first opened the floodgates, smiled and made a quick decision.

"Team Leader Han and Team Leader Kang, you'll have to work hard again."

"Yes, understood."

"We'll go and present it as a gift right away."

A while later, Kang Dong-ho visited Alpha Cast.

He was there to receive the MP3 players.

Although the daily production wasn't high, the reason for taking them all was simple.

It was due to Lee Hyun-woo's morning instructions.

'The president is someone who creates something from nothing. Truly amazing.'

Advertising through blogs.

Not only fresh but also cost-effective.

If the celebrities he knew actively used the blogs, it would be perfect.

As if heaven was helping, he encountered the currently popular Candy Boy in the parking lot of MS Entertainment, right after visiting Alpha Cast.

They were in their car, and he met their manager smoking outside.

"Oh? Team Leader Kang?"

"Meeting you here. So, Manager Jo, where are you headed?"

"No, we've been busy all night, and our kids are taking a quick nap. They couldn't sleep upstairs because the president was watching. And there's another schedule later, so I'm waiting outside."

These days, the fan craze following Candy Boy was no joke. If not guarded like this, it was unpredictable what might happen.

"Still, since Team Leader Kang is here, should I wake them up?"

"No, let them be. They must be tired."

With concerts confirmed in Taiwan and Hong Kong, MS Entertainment was very favorable towards Jungle.

Additionally, due to changes in the distribution structure, they had significant extra income, so the manager treated Kang Dong-ho with respect.

So, what he said next would likely be well received.

"Give this to Candy Boy later."

"What is this?"

"It's an MP3 player. Just yesterday, we sold 2,500 units on our site alone. It's so popular that it might be hard to get soon."

"Oh... an MP3 player? I think I've read about it in the news. You can put MP3 files in it and listen, right?"

"Yes, that's correct."

The manager's eyes were filled with doubt.

It's understandable; the music players he had seen so far weren't this small.

He couldn't help but be curious if it worked properly.

Sensing this, Kang Dong-ho chuckled and handed him his own with earphones.

"If you're skeptical about its performance, give it a try."

He had already downloaded Candy Boy's songs into it.

When he put the earphones into the manager's ears and pressed play,

"Wow... this is really amazing."

His eyes widened in surprise.

"It's a sponsorship. As I mentioned earlier, it's so popular that in a week, you won't be able to buy it even if you have the money. Oh, I also brought one for you, Manager. Here."

"One for me too? Thank you so much."

"But since it's a sponsorship, you know you have to show that you're using it properly, right?"

Kang Dong-ho subtly began to work.

Of course, the manager nodded.

"Of course. I'll make sure they carry it in front of the fans."

"Rather than that, how about taking a few photos and posting them on the blog?"

The company already had an official blog.

Naturally, it was started on Kang Dong-ho's suggestion, and the manager in front of him managed it.

That's why the agency had bought an expensive, latest-model digital camera.

"That much I can do today itself."

"Then please take care of it. I'll go upstairs and give one to the president. As I mentioned, it's so rare that only the president, you, and Candy Boy are getting it as sponsorship."

Though he called it sponsorship, the nuance was that it wouldn't be taken back, which deeply moved the manager, and he tightly held Kang Dong-ho's hand.

"Really, only Team Leader Kang understands me. I don't know about anything else, but I'll give my all for Team Leader Kang and Jungle."

Maybe not to the extent of giving his all, but indeed that night, Candy Boy's manager posted photos on the blog.

And the caption below the photos read,

- The MP3 player from Alpha Cast, MP-MAN, which was hard to get. It's incredibly convenient. It seems like our Candy Boy won't be able to part with it.

It was something that would stimulate fans' desire to purchase.

That day, not a single MP-MAN was left in stock.

* * *

Meanwhile, Clones, singers close to Lee Hyun-woo, also immediately posted pictures of themselves listening to music with the MP3 player on their blog.

'Thanks, guys.'

What should one do if they're grateful?

Naturally, Lee Hyun-woo contacted them late at night to treat them, and the next day, he met the two members of Clones.

As soon as they met, Clones quickly said to Lee Hyun-woo,

"We remember the promise we made before."

"That's right, we said back then that we became famous because of Jungle, so we would promote it without any advertising fees in the future."

"Oh, you don't have to go that far... I'll feel bad. Instead, be our model next time. Of course, you'll be paid fairly."

"It's fine."

One of the Clones members, who had completely shaved his head, insisted on refusing.

But Lee Hyun-woo didn't want that.

"It's because I'd feel uncomfortable. Ah, maybe I can use you guys as advertising models when we expand into Taiwan?"

"Oh, you heard that our popularity is rising in Taiwan?"

"Of course."

"Hey, but wouldn't using a local model be more effective?"

"No, no. You guys will be the Michael Jacksons of Taiwan. So, I must use you as advertising models."

"You're really good at making people feel good."

"Yeah, Hyun-woo, you're the same as ever."

Listening to Clones treating his words as flattery, Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

But the term "Michael Jacksons of Taiwan" wasn't something he made up.

'I don't know how you'll be known this time, but in our past lives, you were on par with Michael Jackson.'

An article from his past life suddenly came to mind.

'Clones, receiving the same performance fee as Michael Jackson in Taiwan!'

This was why he had high expectations for their concert and broadcast activities in Taiwan this summer.

Unaware of this, Clones continued to praise Lee Hyun-woo.

"It would be great if Hyun-woo ran an agency. Everyone would welcome you because you consider the interests of singers."

"That's right. Besides album sales, you created additional income through music downloads and provided more opportunities to earn through blogs. Not to mention, you're pushing for large concerts. Who wouldn't welcome that?"

"Oh, right. I haven't told you guys something."

"Huh?"

"......?"

"After the MP3 players started selling, music downloads have significantly increased."

That's a fact.

And the reason was clear.

"It seems people are downloading songs to put on their devices."

"Ah..."

"That makes sense. Actually, the first thing we did after receiving the MP3 player was to download songs from Jungle Music."

"This means we're getting more income thanks to you, Hyun-woo."

"You'll be greatly rewarded."

"Hey, say it right. Our singers are already being greatly rewarded."

"That's true. Maybe we saved a country in our past lives?"

When the topic of past lives came up, Lee Hyun-woo chuckled.

Then he said,

"You guys wouldn't know, but in my past life, it's true that I lived a life full of regrets. So, in this life, I'm trying to do a lot of fun and enjoyable things. And in doing so, I've ended up helping you guys."

"Then we'll make sure to help you in your next life."

"Why go that far? Let's help Hyun-woo more in this life."

Listening to them seriously but treating it as a joke, Lee Hyun-woo laughed again.

'Just keep doing what you're doing now. Viral advertising by celebrities is incredibly effective.'

* * *

Each day felt different.

The next day, after Jungle Music opened, it recorded its highest sales.

Of course, daily sales had been steadily increasing, but compared to the previous day, downloads had doubled.

"This month's sales have already surpassed three times last month's sales."

"It seems we'll end up achieving more than four times the final amount."

"In addition, Jungle Coin charges are also increasing."

Jungle Coin was a cyber currency created by his younger brother, Lee Jung-woo, for Jungle.

This currency was used for shopping, auctions, and song downloads.

"As a result, Jungle's overall sales are expected to be more than double last month's."

Lee Hyun-woo thought.

The immediate effect of viral marketing was undoubtedly because celebrities stepped in.

'But I feel a bit sorry for Alpha Cast.'

As the saying goes, "The bear does the trick, but the peddler gets the money."

It felt like Jungle was making much more money than Alpha Cast, which had worked hard to produce the MP3 players.

Of course, Alpha Cast also suddenly became popular, so there was no need to feel too guilty.

'Still, I'd like to leave them with even greater profits.'

With a determination to fully support them, Lee Hyun-woo visited Alpha Cast.

And when he met Jung Sung-woo, he said,

"Given the shortage of supply, it seems we need to significantly increase production."

"We didn't expect such a response either. If we had known, we would've borrowed dollars to simultaneously expand production facilities."

"No, don't increase production at Alpha Cast..."

"......"

"Let's start looking for outsourcing companies from now on."
