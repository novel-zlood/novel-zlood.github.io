In fact, in the case of the 3D printer, there was no further progress due to Kim Tae-hyun taking the lead.

Previously, Lee Hyun-woo had planned to change the world, and with help from 【Guseong】, it didn't seem as difficult as he thought.

‘They say that if 【Guseong】 steps in, the world changes.’

Certainly, he felt he would be able to confirm its power in the future.

The same goes for the data center.

A moment later, Kim Tae-hyun, with a satisfied voice, boasted about the data center while sipping his drink.

“You'll see in a few days, it's killer, killer!”

“Will I have a heart attack as soon as I enter?”

“Of course. Make sure to take some calming pills that day.”

“How amazing is it that your voice sounds this confident, hyung?”

“I told you, it's no joke as soon as you enter. The security checkpoint at the entrance is different. No, should I say the reception desk before that is different? By the way, the girl standing there must be a beauty.”

Suddenly, the topic shifted to women at the end.

Then, with a sudden gloomy face, he gulped down his drink.

“Ah, damn it, marriage, marriage! I wanted to live more freely!”

“You've enjoyed your freedom until now. You're thirty-three, hyung, it's about time to settle down.”

“You don't understand my feelings. When you're about to get married... you'll think of me now.”

“Alright, I'll listen to everything you have to say today. Do whatever you want.”

“What is there to do? Oh, right. I do have a request.”

“What is it?”

“Sing the wedding song for me.”

“W-wedding song?”

“Yeah, seeing you sing last year at the year-end... I think you'd be good for a wedding song.”

“Oh... haha, if you insist, I'll sing for you.”

Last year, at the year-end concert held in 【Jungle】's basement.

Lee Hyun-woo also performed two songs.

He realized then that the more you sing, the better you get.

People praised his much more mellow baritone compared to before.

Encouraged by this, Lee Hyun-woo was also practicing composing in his spare time.

‘This is perfect timing. I've been practicing composing recently.’

Returning to the main topic, he started listening to Kim Tae-hyun's many complaints.

But no matter how much he listened, it was just the complaints of someone well-off.

“Hyung, you sound like someone being dragged to the wedding hall.”

“I am being dragged.”

“Don't you like her?”

“No, she's not bad. Actually, she's the perfect bride. But it feels artificial since it's not a free romance. That's why I'm jealous of you. You don't have that with Ah-young.”

“Oh, no. I'm jealous of you, hyung.”

“Me? What is there to be jealous of?”

Caught off guard by this question, he answered without thinking.

“Honeymoon, the honeymoon. It's 14 nights and 15 days! How enviable it is to have someone in the company to cover for you while you're away?”

“Hey, hey, if you knew the reality, you'd never be jealous. You're being jealous of the wrong things.”

“Reality?”

“During the 14 nights and 15 days, my honeymoon will pass through China and Taiwan, then Vietnam, then Europe, and finally a short stop in the U.S. before coming back.”

It was a questionable honeymoon itinerary.

Lee Hyun-woo tilted his head and asked.

“Wow, that's tight. Isn't that too many countries?”

“Why do you think it's like that?”

“Could it be... a business trip?”

“That’s right, man. Honestly, it's partly your fault.”

“My fault?”

“The data center, network equipment, cell phones, and 3D printers... The things we use with you guys don’t just get made.”

“Th-that's true. I didn't realize you were paying this much attention today…”

“I have a sense of responsibility. The problem is the external perception that our products must be the best if handled by our company. To do that, I need to check all the parts, so how busy do you think I am? This honeymoon itinerary was planned with that in mind.”

"Haha..."

Although it felt like he was blaming him, it wasn't entirely untrue, so Lee Hyun-woo gave an awkward laugh.

In fact, Kim Tae-hyun was pushing many initiatives at 【Guseong Electronics】.

Considering how much he had to handle, it was clear how busy he must be.

‘I misunderstood thinking he was taking a long break from the company.’

Realizing now that he couldn't even enjoy his honeymoon properly, he couldn't help but feel sorry.

“I feel sorry for no reason.”

“It's fine. I didn't mean for you to feel that way. In a way, I'm grateful. Because of the projects you started, I've been working non-stop, and it seems like the old-school executives are starting to acknowledge me?”

“Weren’t they at first?”

“They didn’t show it outwardly, but I could read it in their eyes. They were thinking, 'What can a greenhorn who just became an executive do?'”

“Well, it might have been unpleasant for you, but honestly, it’s understandable.”

“Yeah, you're right. Anyway, things are completely different now. Not just the sales figures, but 【Guseong Electronics】 is leading the global market with new innovative products and various hardware. This is something I need to thank you for.”

“Oh, come on. Why are we talking about this now? I came today to cheer you up, hyung.”

“We’re just talking about this and that. But tonight, you’re staying up with me. Got it?”

“Yes, yes, hyung.”

“Cheers!”

“Cheers!”

Although they said they’d stay up all night, they couldn’t actually manage it.

In fact, they drank so much at the beginning that they ended up going home drunk before midnight.

* * *

He had a dream.

A high-ranking reaper from the time of his death appeared.

What he said was etched in his heart even though it was a dream.

【After reviving you and sending you back to the past, there are more workaholics now.】

“I'm sorry. It wasn't intentional.”

【I know. But because of that, I'm in trouble.】

He didn't know what trouble it was, but the reaper's face showed a troubled expression.

【It seems like the number of people dying from overwork will increase. I regret reviving you and sending you back to the past…】

“I'll try. I'll do my best to slow down the progress of technology.”

【That's not what I mean. Technological advancement... When informatization accelerates, it provides lots of useful information to people, which is good. Health information will also be widely known. But balanced development is important, so create an environment where people can work while resting.】

“Yes, yes, I understand.”

Lee Hyun-woo replied several times, etching the words into his heart.

Eventually raising his voice,

“Yes, yes! I understand!”

When he opened his eyes,

‘It was a dream.’

Even though he realized it was a dream, it was so vivid that he almost believed the reaper had really visited him.

‘Really, I need to do something.’

Realizing that people get engrossed in work when involved with him, he decided not to speak of future technologies that could be close to heavenly secrets.

‘What about the things I’ve already mentioned?’

Since he had already started it, he thought he should handle it properly.

Since the public recruitment was approaching, he decided to hire a generous number of people and pressed his temples.

“Oh, my head…”

It was a severe hangover. It was the result of drinking too much the previous day.

From now on, he decided to refrain from drinking as much as possible.

Given the second chance at life, he thought he should live healthily.

* * *

In the morning, pressing his aching head from the hangover, he took a spoonful of the hangover soup his mother had made.

“Why did you drink so much?”

“Ah, Tae-hyun hyung was feeling restless before his wedding…”

“Tae-hyun hyung? Ah, Ah-young's brother?”

“Yes, that's right.”

Obediently answering his mother's question, his father then chimed in.

“Well, you couldn't help it. But if the eldest son of that family gets married, they’ll start thinking about the next in line. Right?”

“Haha…”

He tried to laugh it off this time.

The next in line was, of course, Kim Ah-young, and naturally, it was closely related to Lee Hyun-woo.

But today, he couldn't just brush it off.

“Now that you mention it, if Director Kim Tae-hyun gets married, the next in line is your fiancé, right? Hyung, shouldn't we start thinking about the formal meeting?”

“Hey, why are you thinking about the formal meeting?”

“Not me, I'm talking about our family. Right, mom? Right, dad?”

“Now that you mention it, it’s time to start thinking about it.”

“What do they think on their side?”

Finally, the breakfast table turned into a family meeting.

From the parents’ perspective, there was no need to rush, but it would be a bigger problem if they were completely unprepared.

Why? Because the family they were going to be in-laws with was not just any ordinary family, but the 【Guseong】 family.

Hearing their voices, Lee Hyun-woo realized.

‘They find it difficult.’

It didn't make sense to take it lightly.

Even though his father's business was doing well now, until recently, he had been running a small dyeing factory, and his mother had rolled up her sleeves to help his father.

“They haven’t said anything yet.”

“What about Ah-young?”

“She’s hinted at it…”

“See, see. Hyung, you need to be prepared mentally. Once Director Kim gets married, things will move quickly.”

“Haha…”

Once again, he laughed awkwardly and looked at his parents’ faces.

As expected, their expressions were stiff, indicating they were really preparing mentally.

If it was unavoidable, it was also up to Lee Hyun-woo to make his parents feel at ease.

“I’ll talk with Ah-young about the formal meeting. When would be a good time for you two?”

“Oh? Well… it depends on their side…”

“It’s important to think about their side, but your opinions are more important to me. If I tell Ah-young, she’ll probably coordinate with her parents.”

“Really?”

“Of course. One thing’s for sure, you have a very successful son, so be confident.”

“Right, right. Hyung is really successful.”

The reason he boasted like this was for his parents.

No matter how royal the family is, he wanted to tell them not to be intimidated because Lee Hyun-woo himself was exceptional.

Fortunately, his younger brother spoke up, saying what he couldn’t say himself.

“Honestly, hyung has brought a lot to 【Guseong】. Thanks to our company, 【Guseong Electronics】 became a global powerhouse in the server market, and gained an innovative image in MP3 phones and data centers.”

“Oh… really?”

“……”

“And made a lot of money. 【Jungle Japan】, which invested with our hyung, is about to go public, and they’re expected to make billions of won in profit. Besides, he advised their second daughter on 【First Woolen】's fashion mall, increasing sales and reducing inventory… Wow, as I list these achievements, it seems like their family should be bowing to our hyung and our family instead?”
