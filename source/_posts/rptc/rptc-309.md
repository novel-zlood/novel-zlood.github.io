Thank you. Suggesting we start our newlywed life in Jeju Island was a great idea.

If Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young settle in Jeju Island, everyone will have no choice but to believe 100% in the headquarters relocation project of 【Jungle】.

There are quite a few cases where planned projects are stranded or delayed due to various circumstances, but doesn’t it mean they will actively proceed by living directly in Jeju Island?

“We can’t do that right now.”

However, Lee Hyun-woo shook his head.

“If we live in Jeju Island, it will be very inconvenient.”

“I’m okay with it.”

“Really?”

“Yes, I’m really okay with it. More than that, it would be a bit odd to go when 【Jungle World】 hasn't been built yet.”

“That can be solved by just moving me and the secretarial office.”

“Really? Then how about meetings?”

“We can have them once a week. Either I go up, or people come down.”

“Wouldn’t that make you too distant from the employees?”

“If it’s really an issue, I’ll look for a nearby building. Anyway, right now we are short on buildings, so two subsidiaries can’t move out of the headquarters?”

“Oh, really?”

“Yes.”

As they continued talking, they unintentionally mentioned the possibility of moving to Jeju Island.

Lee Hyun-woo asked Kim Ah-young again.

“Are you really okay with it?”

“I’m okay with it. In fact, I prefer it. Living in Seoul would attract more attention from people.”

“There would be lots of attention there too.”

“Yes, but somehow it feels like it would be more peaceful? If it gets crowded later... people would probably pay attention to other things rather than us, right?”

“Well… yes. People tend to like new things more. By then, I might also become a 'shutterman'. Haha.”

Kim Ah-young laughed hearing Lee Hyun-woo’s laughter.

A ‘shutterman’ is someone who stays at home taking care of the household and operates the shutters of their wife’s workplace.

“If you, who loves working, become a shutterman, you might really get bored.”

“That’s something we’ll only know if we experience it.”

“Okay. Got it. So, we’re really living in Jeju Island?”

“Yes, I like it.”

On that note, Kim Ah-young made a bombshell announcement at home.

She said she would buy a house and set up her newlywed life in Jeju Island.

At first, her doting parents opposed it, but she insisted that she was already thinking about moving to Jeju Island anyway.

“Think about it. The headquarters relocation plan of 【Jungle】 is already underway. Eventually, Hyun-woo has to go. I’ll have to follow him too.”

“It’s not that simple. There are power issues and many other facilities that are not yet expanded…”

“We’re going there to speed things up. It’s better than setting up a newlywed life here and frequently coming and going.”

In the end, Kim Sung-moo and Jang Hee-jin raised their hands in surrender. Especially, Kim Sung-moo thought.

‘Once Hyun-woo makes up his mind, he won’t back out.’

Jang Hee-jin had to consider another direction.

‘What if our daughter feels uncomfortable there?’

Feeling uneasy, she visited her sister-in-law, Kim Sung-hee, the next day.

* * *

“Welcome, unnie.”

“It’s been a while.”

Kim Sung-hee, knowing that Jang Hee-jin had a reason for visiting.

“What brings you here?”

“Ah, yesterday Ah-young said she’s planning to start her newlywed life in Jeju Island.”

“Really? That would be quite inconvenient…”

“Exactly. She doesn’t know anything because she hasn’t done any housework yet.”

Even she wasn’t particularly good at housework. To be precise, she was always good at ordering people around at home.

Although she didn’t have a great business acumen, she sometimes made unexpected requests like now.

“So, I was wondering, can’t we open a department store in Jeju Island?”

“Unnie… The population there is too small.”

“I know. But since last year, 【Jungle】 decided to relocate its headquarters to Jeju Island. Construction companies are planning to sell apartments there, right? If the population increases, the commercial area will improve, and the conditions for opening a department store will be met. Why not consider it as bringing the plan forward?”

“No matter what, it’s not something that can be decided lightly. There needs to be at least a population of 1 million.”

“But there are a lot of tourists, right?”

“That’s why a duty-free shop would be more suitable than a department store.”

Jang Hee-jin’s eyes slightly fluttered.

It was an unreasonable request, but she seemed to have thought it would be accepted.

“Phew, unnie, instead of a department store, I’ll look into opening a mart.”

“A mart?”

“Yes, it’s not as good as a department store, but we can open a large discount store. As you said, if 【Jungle】 settles there, the ripple effect will increase the population.”

A mart is better than nothing, right?

Jang Hee-jin’s expression soon brightened.

“A mart sounds good. It’s not as good as a department store, but it will still be fun for shopping.”

Talking about housework, she actually wanted to provide her daughter with the joy of shopping.

It’s nothing compared to a department store, but she was satisfied with a mart.

‘Phew, why did she suddenly decide to live in Jeju Island…’

* * *

Later, Lee Hyun-woo actively announced to the media that he would start his newlywed life in Jeju Island.

After that, he discussed the direction of the headquarters relocation with the local government of Jeju Island, and they were much more cooperative than before.

Even 【Korean Electric】 stepped in.

In fact, this company owes a great deal to Lee Hyun-woo.

【Korean Electric】's high-speed internet business thrived because 【Jungle】 revived it.

If it weren’t for Lee Hyun-woo, the business would have surely been abandoned, losing to 【Korean Telecom】.

‘Well, not just for that reason, but having their support feels like having a thousand troops.’

The power issue, which was the first problem to be solved, seemed to be somewhat addressed, making the relocation of 【Jungle】 and its partner companies smoother.

Moreover, as this issue was resolved, the construction companies stepped on the gas.

In other words, they sped up the apartment sales in Jeju Island.

Lastly, 【New World Group】 suddenly decided to open a large discount store in Jeju Island.

They claim it’s to prepare for the increasing population, but the timing suggests it’s related to Kim Ah-young.

‘What if they operate at a loss because of us?’

Opening a large discount store is no small matter.

When a large retail company moves in, other small retail companies must also move in together.

At least they need to send dispatched employees, which indicated a faster development of Jeju Island’s living infrastructure, a piece of good news for Lee Hyun-woo.

‘Now, we just need to move 【Jungle Holdings】 before the wedding.’

Furthermore, he needed to select the subsidiaries that would move together, so discussions with the CEOs were essential.

Lee Hyun-woo called Woo Sang-won and three others.

And they seemed to predict what Lee Hyun-woo was going to say, as Woo Sang-won spoke first.

“We already discussed among ourselves. We agreed that it’s better for 【Jungle Communication】 and 【Jungle Game】 to stay in Seoul, while the other two subsidiaries move with 【Jungle Holdings】.”

“Oh? I didn’t even ask…”

“Isn’t that why you called us?”

“Yes, that’s right.”

“That’s why we discussed it in advance.”

“Wow… this makes things easier. Thanks for agreeing in advance.”

“CEO, you’re busy with the wedding preparations, right? We should handle these things in advance.”

In fact, the wedding was just two weeks away.

He thought he had prepared well to avoid being busy, but now it seemed like there were still many things to handle.

Moreover, initiating the headquarters relocation added more tasks.

Having them handle things on their own was really reassuring.

‘With these people, I can really go on my honeymoon without worries.’

14 nights and 15 days, a whole fortnight, leaving the company for this period wasn’t simple.

But with the reliable CEOs of the subsidiaries, the gap seemed minimal.

“Thank you, everyone.”

“Don’t mention it. Make sure to prepare well for the wedding.”

“You don’t have many days left as a bachelor, enjoy this time as well.”

“Yes, CEO. If you want, I can take you to a nightclub one last time.”

“No, thanks. Haha.”

Lee Hyun-woo laughed brightly, rejecting Oh Min-woo’s suggestion.

‘I’m really getting married.’

This is his first marriage in his second life.

His first marriage in his previous life failed, but this time, he vowed to live happily till the end.

* * *

Finally, it was the wedding day.

Even after going through it twice, the excitement didn’t fade.

‘This should never become routine.’

Still, he was busy greeting people.

The wedding at the outdoor venue of 【Seorabeol Hotel】 was attended by many guests.

Looking around, it was evident a lot of money had been spent.

The entire venue was covered with fresh flowers, and a quartet and choir were waiting for the wedding.

Although he didn’t want such a luxurious wedding, a wedding isn’t something that can be done solely based on his will or stubbornness.

‘Phew, but we’re setting up our newlywed life in Jeju Island instead.’

They had already found a house, but the house he and Kim Ah-young looked at was too spacious.

Maybe they thought about the need for staff to work in that house, so they chose a large one.

This was something to discuss with Kim Ah-young during the honeymoon.

‘Too many thoughts. Let’s focus on the wedding.’

Anyway, the ceremony was about to start.

Although it was his second wedding combining past and present lives, Lee Hyun-woo’s face was full of nervousness and excitement.

As he took each step, he couldn’t see the faces of the people.

He was always composed, but not on his wedding day.

Then, the wedding march began.

Kim Ah-young, looking more beautiful than ever, was approaching him, holding Kim Sung-moo’s hand.

Lee Hyun-woo stepped forward in large strides.

‘Am I going out too fast?’

He covered more distance than the distance Kim Sung-moo and Kim Ah-young walked.

He could hear people’s light laughter.

He really couldn’t focus.

Even after that, nothing changed.

He couldn’t hear what the officiant was saying.

He just answered “Yes!” loudly when asked, “Do you, groom Lee Hyun-woo, promise to love Kim Ah-young until your hair turns gray?”

When exchanging rings, they put them on the wrong fingers, causing another round of laughter.

“Haha…”

Embarrassed, Lee Hyun-woo somehow managed to finish the ceremony and greeted the guests at the restaurant after the pyebaek (a traditional Korean ceremony where the newlyweds pay respects to the groom’s family).

Looking around, the food was also extravagant.

It was a truly luxurious wedding.

‘This is indeed a happy life.’

Although he was happy, what occupied Lee Hyun-woo’s mind was still the purpose of his second life.

He firmly believed that he hadn’t come back for nothing over the past few years.

‘I should live to give back.’

To whom?

First and foremost, to his parents and his soon-to-be wife, Kim Ah-young, his younger brother Lee Jung-woo, and potentially future children.

In other words, family comes first.

Then, he would extend it to the people he knows.

He wished happiness for anyone around him.

If he thought more broadly, it would be for the people of the world.

Having been reborn and achieving great success, he decided to give back to his family, friends, and the people of the world.

As he boarded the plane for his honeymoon after the wedding, Lee Hyun-woo made another resolution.

‘I should live thinking that the start of my second life is from now.’
