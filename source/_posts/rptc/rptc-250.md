While Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young were talking, Kim Ah-jin approached them.

Perhaps because she worked at a fashion company, she was neatly and elegantly dressed. Holding up a vinyl bag, she told him.

“Oppa, I bought this.”

“Oh, you didn’t have to?”

“The clothes were nice, so I bought them. And I stood in a really long line to buy this. For your information, father-in-law paid for it.”

“Dad did?”

“Yes, the store was so busy that he was at the register himself.”

“Haha…”

Lee Hyun-woo was deeply touched.

Kim Ah-young had mentioned earlier that she had done a lot for her siblings, but he felt that he had actually received quite a bit of help. He kept thinking about reciprocating.

So he said,

“You should start thinking about it too.”

“About what?”

“What else? That fast fashion brand.”

“Really? Is that okay?”

Kim Ah-jin widened her eyes in surprise, and Lee Hyun-woo nodded with a grin.

“If it does well, others will jump in anyway. I thought it’d be better if you did it rather than someone else.”

“But it’s being done by the in-laws, so it’s uncomfortable for me. Oh, oppa, instead of that, how about I invest in 【GAPE KOREA】?”

Hearing Kim Ah-jin’s serious voice, Lee Hyun-woo’s pupils dilated.

‘She's serious.’

【GAPE】 is the pioneer of fast fashion brands.

However, the most successful SPA in Korea was Japan’s 【Unique】.

‘They are probably a small business by now…’

Lee Hyun-woo thought.

If 【First Wool】 launched it first, it would have the advantage of being a market leader.

Of course, it would be great if Lee Hyun-woo’s father could dominate the market through the joint venture 【GAPE KOREA】 without any competitors, but that was almost impossible.

In a traditional market economy, monopolies are rarely left alone.

Seeing something doing well, others will surely follow quickly, so he thought it would be fine for 【First Wool】 to launch a fast fashion brand without getting bogged down and recommended it to Kim Ah-jin.

Unexpectedly, she declined.

‘She doesn’t want to enter the market because the in-laws are doing it?’

It was an absurd idea if you think about it a bit deeper.

How many conglomerates in our country are linked as in-laws?

Many are connected through multiple layers of in-law relationships.

So, the idea of hesitating because the in-laws entered the market first was absurd.

But Kim Ah-jin still seemed innocent.

‘Well, she hasn’t been in society for long…’

Instead, she said she wanted to invest in her father’s company, and Lee Hyun-woo quickly responded with a smile.

“Then, you should discuss it directly with my father.”

“Oh, right… So when can I meet him?”

“Won’t there be working-level staff in both companies? If it’s uncomfortable for you to go directly, proceed with the investment through them.”

“I’ll do that.”

These two were quite comfortable with each other, but since Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young were not yet married, they thought they should maintain certain boundaries.

Especially since their parents hadn’t met yet, Kim Ah-jin might be worried about making a mistake in front of her in-laws.

Lee Hyun-woo noticed this and let her know in this way.

But Kim Ah-young, who was listening nearby, was also uncomfortable and changed the topic entirely.

“Let’s stop talking about business now. It’s almost lunchtime. Shall we go eat together?”

“No, I have to go, unnie.”

Was she intentionally trying to let Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young have their date?

Kim Ah-jin shook her head.

“Alright, see you at home later.”

“Enjoy your lunch. Oppa too.”

“Yeah, you too.”

Now, calling each other oppa and sister-in-law felt natural.

Kim Ah-young’s face was full of smiles, perhaps because she liked those terms.

Their good mood continued even at the restaurant, so she asked Lee Hyun-woo brightly,

“What if 【First Wool】 really enters the fast fashion brand market?”

“What else? It will be a healthy competition between in-laws.”

“Phew… You don’t mean that.”

“I was sincere.”

“No matter how sincere you are, don’t say that next time. My sister feels awkward about it.”

“Really? I didn’t know.”

“Of course. We’ve received so much help from you.”

“You keep talking about help, but honestly, I don’t think I’ve helped your sister that much?”

“You’ve helped a lot. From integrating fashion with websites to using blogs. And recently, the 【Internet Art Gallery】 is doing well too.”

“Oh? Really?”

This was unexpected.

He thought it would be hard to succeed commercially.

‘The representative there was Hwang Man, right?’

Listening to Kim Ah-young’s continuous explanation,

“Yeah, I thought trading art through auctions wouldn’t be popular either, but more people are using it than I expected. Of course, the number of visitors is significantly lower than other online shopping malls, but the transaction rate is very high compared to the number of visitors.”

He was very intrigued.

Kim Ah-young, who couldn’t miss his interest, continued her summary while they ate.

“They’ve been using the 【Jungle】 blog for promotion, but recently they’ve been focusing on ‘Make friends’ activities for people who like art. There are more specific demand groups interested in art than I thought, and my sister introduced a lot of them.”

“Ah…”

“Representative Hwang persuaded senior and mid-career artists, and my sister talked to young artists who studied abroad, so they exhibited some works online.”

“Wow…”

“As this became known, the number of interested visitors increased, and it’s been a virtuous cycle. Recently, they are preparing to revamp the site for the original purpose of Representative Hwang, which is the popularization of art. My sister is helping with that too.”

“Amazing. I didn’t expect it to succeed this way.”

Even in a recession, some places do well.

Or when one side collapses, the other side creates.

‘I didn’t expect it to explode here.’

Lee Hyun-woo’s mouth slightly opened at the good news.

“You shouldn’t be surprised since you connected my sister with Representative Hwang. Above all, this girl was the most surprised, so now she would believe anything you say.”

“Haha…”

Lee Hyun-woo finally understood Kim Ah-jin’s enthusiasm for investment.

She valued Lee Hyun-woo’s business sense highly due to the success of the 【Internet Art Gallery】.

‘Even though 【GAPE】 is the pioneer of fast fashion brands, it’s hard to guarantee continuous success from day one, so it was hard to fully understand the sudden desire to invest.’

Anyway, it’s rewarding to have connected investors with young entrepreneurs at the 21st-century venture business association last time.

* * *

After lunch, Kim Ah-young said she had to go to the hotel, so she bid farewell to Lee Hyun-woo.

After parting ways with her, Lee Hyun-woo headed back to the 【GAPE KOREA】 store, where he ran into Kim Na-yoon.

“Oppa!”

“Huh?”

She was busy taking pictures with what seemed to be a friend.

“Jisoo, you know my oppa, right?”

“Hello.”

“Oh, hi, haha.”

Kim Na-yoon was very sociable.

Even now, she was talking about herself freely to Lee Hyun-woo.

“Oppa, I bought some clothes here and now I’m taking pictures to upload on my blog.”

“Oh, how should I thank you?”

“No need to thank me, I’m the one who should be grateful. You bought me some rice cakes and taffy recently.”

“Hahaha.”

Lee Hyun-woo’s mouth was split sideways after seeing two sisters-in-law today.

Maybe it’s because he didn’t have any sisters-in-law in his past life?

Everything they did seemed cute and lovely.

Most prospective brothers-in-law probably feel the same way before marriage.

Wanting to treat and buy everything for their future sisters-in-law.

Probably because of this, he mentioned something that was recently posted on the blog.

“By the way, have you decided on your major?”

“Yes, I’m planning to major in design. She’s going there too.”

“Oh, really? So, both of you are going to study web design?”

“I’m going for web design, and she’s going for industrial design.”

Kim Na-yoon’s friend was either very shy or didn’t speak much, only smiling.

Looking at the two, Lee Hyun-woo quickly suggested.

“Then why don’t you work part-time at our company during the vacation?”

“Part-time?”

Offering a part-time job to a third-generation chaebol.

But Lee Hyun-woo didn’t care.

“It’s good to gain experience. If your friend wants, she can come for a part-time job too.”

“Oh? Really? Is that okay?”

“Of course.”

Kim Na-yoon’s quieter friend seemed more pleased.

That made both of them even cuter, so he said,

“Why don’t I buy you something delicious if you haven’t eaten yet?”

“Wow, oppa, you keep bribing me.”

“Of course. I have to be on good terms with my youngest sister-in-law to have a comfortable married life later, don’t I?”

“Is that so?”

“Yes, tell me whatever you want to eat. I’ll buy you anything.”

Kim Na-yoon, who was hesitating, asked her friend.

“Hmm, what do you want to eat?”

“Hamburger?”

“Okay, let’s have a hamburger.”

In the end, Lee Hyun-woo took the two to a hamburger place.

On the way and even after arriving, Kim Na-yoon was busy taking pictures.

“I think I’ll have a lot to post on the blog today. I’ll promote the in-laws’ clothes and brag about meeting oppa and getting something delicious.”

“You seem to blog a lot.”

“Yes, it’s almost an addiction. So is she.”

“That’s right. I’m so grateful to the person who made this… what should I call you, sir… CEO?”

“Call me whatever you’re comfortable with.”

“Okay, then. I’m so grateful to you, sir.”

“Do a lot of your classmates blog?”

“Of course. If you don’t do it these days, you’re considered a spy. Not just blogging, but we also have reunions and meet old elementary school friends through ‘Make Friends.’”

At first, she seemed to hide her face.

Now, like a floodgate opening, Kim Na-yoon’s friend started talking a lot.

Thanks to that, Lee Hyun-woo could see how well 【Jungle】’s two SNS contents were working with teenagers.

When Han Se-jin brought out the hamburgers, their chatter stopped.

Instead, questions started.

“Oppa, why aren’t you eating?”

“Yeah, are we the only ones eating?”

“Oh, I ate a bit earlier.”

“Really, with unnie?”

“Ding-dong-dang.”

“Wow, I’m jealous.”

“Me too. Is there someone like him around us?”

It’s natural for high school senior girls to turn their attention to dating after studying.

Seeing Kim Na-yoon and her friend’s reactions, Lee Hyun-woo laughed.

‘By the way, someone like me?’

He used to be ranked as the top groom candidate, but he didn’t expect to be popular with teenagers too.

No, it was awkward. It was attention he didn’t receive much in his past life.

Come to think of it, many people around Lee Hyun-woo were also turning their eyes in this direction.

At first, he didn’t notice, but if he listened carefully, he could hear people’s conversations mentioning “It’s Lee Hyun-woo” and “He’s handsome.”

‘This is embarrassing.’

He suddenly recalls the power of SNS that dominated people’s daily lives in his previous life.

At that time, the developer and founder of 【Face Note】 instantly became a role model for young people, and in this life, it seems Lee Hyun-woo will steal that fame.
