After a short while, Kim Sung-moo's sister, Kim Sung-hee, her husband, and their children arrived. 

Since Lee Hyun-woo already knew that Kim Sung-hee of 【New World Department Store】 had been paying attention to 【GAPE Korea】, he had no choice but to greet them politely.

"Nice to meet you."

"Indeed. We finally see each other. But because Ah-young talks about you so much, it doesn't feel like the first time. Right, darling?"

"Hahaha."

Kim Ah-young's face was slightly flushed, and Lee Hyun-woo gave an awkward smile.

Still, Lee Hyun-woo has a principle that any favor received must be repaid in some way.

"I heard from my father last time. Thanks to you, it looks like the business will proceed without any issues. I was planning to visit and thank you personally later."

"You're busy, no need to make time for that. Besides, we also welcome 【GAPE Korea】 entering our store. The department store industry is tough these days, so we hope that this new venture boosts sales for a win-win situation."

"Honey, we didn't come here during Chuseok to talk business."

"Did we?"

Their business conversation was interrupted by her husband.

However, Hyun-woo was still thinking internally.

He would repay the kindness somehow, someday.

At a gathering of peers, her son and Kim Ah-young’s cousin Yoo Hee-seok started the conversation.

"Recently, we are preparing an online market by combining distribution and information technology."

"That's a good idea."

Lee Hyun-woo actively responded.

No matter how much they are told not to talk business, it seemed impossible to separate business from the atmosphere of this house.

"Actually, our model is 【Jungle】, but we’re not sure how it will go."

"You have a much better environment than us. It will succeed."

"A better environment?"

"Yes, because you have offline stores already established. You can use a one-click delivery system, utilizing department stores and supermarkets for delivery, which can ensure customer convenience and increase sales simultaneously."

"Oh? That’s a good idea. So, you mean if someone clicks on an item in the online market, it gets delivered from the nearest department store or supermarket?"

"Yes, but there would need to be a minimum purchase amount."

"Of course."

"Ah, hyung, please speak comfortably. Even Tae-hyun hyung speaks comfortably with me."

"Hahaha, should I then?"

When Kim Tae-hyun was mentioned in the conversation, he quickly interjected.

"There was something I wanted to ask earlier."

"Servers? Yes, they continue to have a good outlook."

Realizing that the earlier conversation interrupted by Jang Hee-jin, Lee Hyun-woo now provided an answer.

"Then what should we do? Should we continue with servers, or should we move back to computers?"

"I'm an outsider, so the decision is up to you, hyung. But if the group's capabilities are too dispersed, it would be better to focus on one area and aim for the top."

"You mean to focus on servers."

"Hey, that's your decision, hyung."

"Got it, buddy. We'll go that route."

"Oh, and investments in semiconductors should not be stopped."

"That’s a strict order from our father, so it won’t be reduced."

It seemed that 【Guseong Electronics】's semiconductors would continue to thrive in this life as well.

"By the way, the upcoming 【Macro Soft】 Windows 97 includes an upgraded web browser. Won’t that affect you?"

Showing some interest in 【Jungle】, Tae-hyun asked, otherwise, it seemed he was only looking out for his own interests.

Hyun-woo smiled and nodded.

"【Macro Soft】 is already the market winner. We are just challengers."

"Even though you say that, you talk as if you're confident of winning."

"No, not at all."

Although he denied it, in Hyun-woo’s mind, he thought this new web browser was not to be underestimated.

‘This reminds me of the clone from 【Single】.’

He felt a desire to win against 【Macro Soft】's Internet Ex Cross.

‘Maybe I should plan my early retirement after surpassing 【Macro Soft】?’

He wasn’t sure, but the two people other than Hyun-woo seemed to keep holding him back.

"I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to meet regularly to exchange technology or ideas."

"Oh? You thought so too? So did I. For example, I would like 【Jungle】’s help with the one-click system mentioned earlier. And if your company needs storage or transportation, we could help too."

"That’s truly mutual assistance. Hyun-woo, what do you think?"

Having just announced Kim Ah-young as his girlfriend, Hyun-woo inevitably seemed to be getting closer to them.

Hence, he had no choice but to answer Tae-hyun’s question.

"Sounds good, hahaha."

* * *

Meanwhile, Billy Kates, the chairman of 【Macro Soft】, whom Hyun-woo had set as a target, was meeting Steven Job of 【Pineapple】, who had come to see him.

Steven, who had come without notice, immediately got to the point after a short greeting.

"Invest in us."

"In what? Your company?"

"Yes."

"If I acquire shares, it will be troublesome. Even though you founded the company, you were kicked out and became penniless."

"Don’t exaggerate. Then I will tell everyone it was because of you."

"Because of me? What nonsense is that?"

"You copied all our company’s software! You’re not going to deny that, are you?"

"Huh... anyone who hears you might think it's true."

"It is true."

"Sigh, fine. I’ll invest without any selfish interests. How much do you need?"

"Before that, I need a promise regarding the shares I mentioned earlier."

"What promise?"

"They should be non-voting shares."

"What?"

"When our company surpasses yours in market capitalization, cash them out, live well, and let’s call it even."

"Don’t be ridiculous."

The two were known rivals.

However, it wasn't that they had no acquaintance at all.

In the past, when 【Pineapple】 was thriving, they had subcontracted their operating systems to 【Macro Soft】.

They remained in a bickering relationship due to the acquaintance formed back then.

The claim that Billy Kates copied 【Pineapple】's software also stemmed from this ambiguity.

"Sigh, talking to you just makes me angry... alright."

"Alright means? 1 million dollars. That's the maximum amount I’ll invest in your company. I don’t have the capacity to invest in insignificant places."

"I’m giving you an opportunity, but you’re not making the most of it."

"Fine, I’ll just throw away that opportunity, take the 1 million dollars and get lost."

Steven Job shrugged his shoulders.

His eyes looked better than before.

It meant he was grateful even for the 1 million dollars.

"Okay. I’ll take that and make it the world’s best portal site."

"You’ve lost your touch. That market has already been pre-empted."

"Is that why you announced that you’re wrapping up PC communications and moving to a portal site?"

"We are different from you. We have capital. You came here asking for investment because you lack resources."

"Hmph."

This time, Steven Job was at a loss for words.

He was a man with strong pride.

Despite that, he came here asking for investment, which meant he was putting great effort into the portal site.

"I can’t help it. You should get into this quickly. When our company launches the portal site, I’ll crush your company."

"Yeah, keep talking big to ease your inferiority complex. But now 【Pineapple】 is no match for 【Macro Soft】. We will step over 【Yaho】 and surpass 【Jungle】. Your company is not even on the radar."

Billy Kates exuded strong confidence.

However, the order in which he mentioned the portal sites was somewhat peculiar.

Currently, 【Yaho】 has a higher market share, but he spoke as if 【Jungle】 was at the top.

In reality, Billy Kates was quite conscious of 【Jungle】.

The reason was simple.

‘Launched a web browser in Korea?’

He recently received a report that the market share of Internet Ex Cross in Korea was rapidly declining.

Naturally, at the forefront of his mind was 【Jungle】 as a competitor.

It must have hurt his pride, but Steven Job kept reaching out.

"By the way, what about the search engine? What will you do? I heard there's a rumor that 【Jungle】's is the best. 【Yaho】 is also reportedly using theirs this time."

"Of course, we will develop our own."

"Because of pride?"

"No, because we keep boosting 【Jungle】."

"Okay, that’s good."

"What do you mean by good?"

"We're also using our own search engine, right? If you don’t want to use 【Jungle】's search engine, why don't we collaborate and upgrade it together?"

Billy Kates pondered over Steven Job's proposal.

Currently, both companies' portal sites could be considered latecomers.

'Hmm, if it’s a way to rise without using 【Jungle】's search engine, that’s not bad.'

Ultimately, collaboration to concentrate their capabilities wouldn’t be a bad idea.

Billy Kates nodded his head.

Quickly, he laid out his terms.

"When we part ways later, don’t cling. Then we’ll develop it together."

"What?"

"Things like earlier, saying I copied or whatever, it’s annoying."

"Who are you to say that? Don’t worry. If we kill 【Jungle】's search engine, I’ll prepare for a clean break."

"Okay, that sounds good."

"Now you're listening to me. You’ll be immensely grateful to me later."

"Who are you to say that? Investing and bringing in our company’s amazing developers, I’m doing you a favor."

"Hmph."

Steven Job snorted.

However, it didn’t seem like he was asserting his pride again.

In the past, he might have said he wouldn't collaborate out of spite, but not now.

‘He has grown a lot as a businessman after going through hardships.’

Billy Kates thought.

If Steven Job could revive 【Pineapple】, it would become the biggest rival of 【Macro Soft】.

‘No, there’s also 【Jungle】.’

【Yaho】 also came to mind subtly.

Perhaps, the IT Sengoku period might arrive in the future.

Of course, the final winner would undoubtedly be 【Macro Soft】.

Billy Kates' eyes sparkled with confidence.

* * *

Lee Hyun-woo was finally summoned by Kim Sung-moo.

Apparently, he wanted to talk to Hyun-woo separately in his office.

Given the atmosphere of this house, where business and casual conversations were mixed, Hyun-woo was prepared.

He was sure another business conversation would start.

However.

"I have just one thing to ask."

Kim Sung-moo intended to keep it short and strong.

"If you make my daughter cry, you'll die by my hand."

No matter how much of a giant in the business world he was, he was just an ordinary father.

So, Hyun-woo answered in a serious voice.

"Yes, I promise. I will do my best to make sure Ah-young never sheds a tear."

Only then did Kim Sung-moo extend his hand, and Hyun-woo took it.

It was warmer than he expected.
