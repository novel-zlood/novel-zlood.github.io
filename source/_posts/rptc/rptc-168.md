Of course, the first collaboration with Lee Hwan was the long-awaited fashion coordination by Kim Na-yoon.

Lee Hyun-woo addressed it first.

“I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but it seems you need to pick out clothes for a non-professional model.”

“I’ve heard bits and pieces. But you haven’t told me who it is.”

This confirmed that Choi Sun-hwa was fairly discreet.

Thinking that he could involve her in important future projects, Lee Hyun-woo revealed the identity of the model.

“She’s a blogger named Kim Na-yoon. Also, she’s the youngest daughter of Guseong Group.”

“...?!”

A look of surprise and confusion simultaneously appeared in Lee Hwan's eyes.

And the questions he had were not unlike those Lee Hyun-woo had faced before.

‘Why her specifically?’

‘How did she become a model for Jungle?’

‘Does Hyun-woo have that much influence?’

‘Is this somehow related to Guseong?’

However, he didn’t ask these questions out loud.

Instead, he nodded and replied.

“I haven’t seen the model in person. Can I see her directly?”

“She’s currently a high school senior preparing for exams, so she doesn’t have much free time. It would probably only be possible on the day of the shoot.”

“But I need to get a rough idea of her appearance and body type.”

“I’m really sorry, but it can only be through photos.”

“Oh, that’s fine.”

Lee Hwan quickly responded, indicating his understanding.

This alone showed that he wasn’t the same person as in the past life.

Although he was still confident, in his past life, he would explode with sensitivity if things didn’t go his way.

That was the part Lee Hyun-woo disliked the most back then.

‘I don’t know how things will turn out later, but for now, it’s okay.’

All evaluations were on hold for now.

Thinking this, Lee Hyun-woo showed the computer screen.

“Here it is.”

“Oh, right. You said she’s a blogger?”

“Yes, she’s quite famous, probably more than we think. Especially popular among her age group.”

Listening to Lee Hyun-woo, Lee Hwan examined the monitor.

Then he asked.

“Can I get this photo in print?”

“Of course. But is that enough?”

“It would be better if it were life-sized, but that’s impossible. Hahaha.”

“It’s possible.”

“Pardon?”

“We can get permission from Ms. Kim Na-yoon and have a company print it life-sized.”

“Oh… Can you do that for me?”

“Yes, I’ll take care of it.”

This level of sensitivity was welcomed by Lee Hyun-woo.

It could lead to better fashion coordination.

Thus, he mentioned it to Kim Ah-young, who came to visit in the evening.

“Is it okay if I occasionally call Na-yoon?”

“Huh? Oh, uh… well, it’s okay, I guess…”

“I’ll keep it short so it doesn’t interfere with her studies.”

“Oh… uh… okay.”

Her hesitant speech suggested she wasn’t too pleased with what Lee Hyun-woo was doing.

‘This is nerve-wracking.’

In reality, Kim Ah-young was extremely anxious that her father might find out about what was going on.

She wanted Lee Hyun-woo to leave a good impression.

Yet, she couldn’t stop him for a reason.

‘Sigh, this benefits Hyun-woo’s father’s company…’

Kim Ah-young recently confirmed that the brand Aejung Apparel had made significant strides on Jungle’s online shopping mall.

Of course, it was Kim Ah-jin who informed her.

- Some products are said to be paradigm-shifting in fashion wholesale and retail. Hyun-woo oppa is really amazing.

Naturally, her way of addressing him changed from ‘Mr. Hyun-woo’ to ‘Hyun-woo oppa.’

Once again, she realized that proving oneself through skill leads to recognition.

Therefore, if Lee Hyun-woo’s father manages an even larger company, he would receive appropriate recognition.

‘Then, our romantic relationship won’t be an issue?’

There would come a day when she wouldn’t have to ambiguously navigate her relationship with Lee Hyun-woo among family.

So, she had no choice but to tell him he could call Kim Na-yoon.

‘Oh well, whatever happens, happens.’

If the results are good, all will be forgiven.

That’s what Kim Ah-young thought.

* * *

That evening, Lee Hyun-woo first contacted Kim Na-yoon via text, and seeing her call back without replying, he chuckled.

‘The three sisters have distinctly different characters.’

Perhaps it was because she was young, but Kim Na-yoon was very straightforward.

“Hello?”

(It’s me, oppa. Why did you call?)

“Do you have a digital camera ready?”

(They said no way, hmph.)

Kim Na-yoon’s whiny voice made Lee Hyun-woo laugh.

“Alright, then how about coming to our company this Sunday?”

(Huh? To Jungle?)

“Yes, just come to the new building. The interior construction is almost finished. Ah, you don't need to know this. Anyway, everything will be sorted out if you come. Got it?”

(Oh, okay… But what exactly are we doing that day?)

“What do you mean? We’re going to take your pictures.”

(Really?)

“Yes, I’ll have the digital camera, the photographer, and the designer to pick out your clothes all ready. So see you then, okay?”

(Okay, oppa.)

“Oh, and I’ll print your photo life-sized for the designer.”

(Got it!)

Kim Na-yoon’s voice, showing her emotions plainly, sounded more lively than before.

And a few days later, it was Sunday.

When Kim Na-yoon arrived at Jungle’s new ten-story building, her eyes widened.

More precisely, it was after she saw the studio on the second floor.

“Wow, is there really a studio inside the company?”

“Yes, we built one during the expansion. We take and upload product photos frequently.”

“It’s too well-equipped for a place that takes product photos.”

“We also need to photograph models for the products.”

Especially since they planned to use non-professional models frequently, Lee Hyun-woo wanted to set up the studio properly.

The photography team he hired today was also well-known for their skills.

“Alright, let’s introduce you to everyone. You need to make a good impression so they take good photos of you.”

“Okay, oppa.”

Lee Hyun-woo managed Kim Na-yoon like a manager.

When they were done with the introductions, fashion designer Lee Hwan arrived.

“Nice to meet you.”

“Yes, nice to meet you.”

After meeting Lee Hyun-woo, Lee Hwan finally received the full-body photo of Kim Na-yoon.

He then visited Lee Hyun-woo’s father’s company to pick clothes that would suit her style.

Now, as he handed over the items he chose to Kim Na-yoon, he was excited.

“I didn’t design these myself, but I picked clothes that I think would suit you, Na-yoon.”

“Oh? These are autumn clothes.”

“Summer is almost over.”

“True.”

The two quickly began talking without any awkwardness.

In the past life, Lee Hwan wasn’t someone who got intimidated by anyone.

To be precise, he lived on his pride.

It was so severe that he suffered from a severe case of the celebrity syndrome that often afflicts stars.

‘This is just right. He’s saying what he needs to a chaebol daughter without losing his manners.’

Watching the two from the side, Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

Then he spoke.

“Alright, Na-yoon, today you’re becoming our company’s model. Got it?”

“Yes, yes!”

“Mr. Lee is also our company’s chief designer for today.”

“Haha… Okay, understood.”

A few days ago, Lee Hyun-woo told Kim Na-yoon over the phone that she didn’t need the digital camera confiscated by Kim Sung-moo and to just come as she was.

Of course, she didn’t come alone, but with a bodyguard,

“I really feel like a real model.”

She looked much happier.

With a face that seemed to have shed all her study stress, she participated in the shoot, and the photos came out great.

After the shoot, when Lee Hyun-woo checked the photos, he was worried that they might look too professional.

Naturally, he muttered to himself.

“It should look a bit amateurish…”

“......”

“......”

“Come to think of it, people nowadays can’t really tell the difference.”

“......?”

In the future, netizens could easily spot ads on blogs, but those eyes didn’t exist now.

Rather, wouldn’t the good photos of Kim Na-yoon’s style stimulate them?

“Alright, we need to settle the model fee. Na-yoon, is there anything you want?”

“Oh, no. Just having this experience is enough.”

“But I can’t exploit your labor.”

“If you really insist, then please buy me a meal.”

“Sure, what do you want to eat?”

“Hmm… well… come to think of it, it doesn’t have to be now, right?”

“Huh?”

“Let’s do it later.”

“Why? Are you busy today?”

“No. I want to think about what to eat, and ask for something really delicious.”

“Okay, got it. I’ll even add interest when I buy you the meal.”

“Yay, exciting!”

Even though she was a chaebol daughter, she seemed so pure.

However,

‘I wanted to settle everything with Lee Hwan today.’

That was a bit disappointing.

Of course, he planned to pay Lee Hwan separately, but he wanted to have a meal together out of gratitude.

So, after transferring the digital camera photos to a CD and giving it to Kim Na-yoon, Lee Hyun-woo suggested to Lee Hwan.

“I’d like to treat you to a meal. Do you have time?”

“Rather than a meal, I prefer alcohol.”

“Sounds good, alcohol it is.”

“Oh, and I like sashimi.”

“Got it. Let’s go. Hahaha.”

So far, Lee Hwan had made a very good impression on Lee Hyun-woo.

* * *

Later at a sashimi restaurant.

“Can I ask what your dream is, Mr. Lee?”

“What could a designer’s dream be? It’s for the day when my clothes are recognized.”

“Then…”

“......”

“Forgive me for asking, but what kind of clothes do you want to make?”

Lee Hwan’s pupils shook at this question.

He didn’t know the intention behind the question.

Sensing this, Lee Hyun-woo elaborated.

“What I’m curious about is… do you want to make clothes for a specific minority, or for a large number of people?”

The reason Lee Hyun-woo asked this was simple.

‘In the past life, he said he wanted to make clothes for a specific minority.’

Specifically, he wanted to sell expensive clothes like luxury brands to a wealthy specific class.

If Lee Hwan had the same thought in this life, Lee Hyun-woo would conclude that their collaboration wouldn’t work.

However,

“After graduation, I was very stubborn about what I wanted. So, I often went hungry.”

It seemed that in this life, he might be headed in a different direction.

“While starving, I thought a lot. About the path I should take. Initially, I wanted to make clothes for a specific class, but now, I want many people to wear my clothes… haha… maybe because I was so hungry, I started having such desires.”

“Then that’s great news.”

“Pardon?”

“You probably met my father recently.”

“Oh, yes, I did. He’s a good person.”

“He dreams of running an apparel company. Currently, he plans to buy products from places like Dongdaemun and sell them at our company, but he wants to hire designers and create clothes that many people seek.”

“Oh… yes…”

“I want to help my father. And if you’re interested, I’d like you to help him as well.”

It was a kind of scouting offer, but Lee Hyun-woo wasn’t sure how it was received.

So he expressed it more clearly.

“I’ll invest in your current company. If you wish, I can even send you to study in Italy later. In return, I’d like you to exclusively design for my father’s company. Of course, products that the market wants.”

“Products that the market wants…?”

“Specifically, I’m asking you to create ‘products’ rather than ‘artworks.’ We can negotiate the contract terms and make it for several years. I will provide the best environment for you.”

Lee Hyun-woo’s request was not just about his father’s dream but also about his unfulfilled aspiration.

‘Could I achieve the dream of the world’s best fast fashion brand that I couldn’t in the past life?’

Of course, not by Lee Hyun-woo, but by his father.

‘Would it be appropriate to call this vicarious satisfaction?’
