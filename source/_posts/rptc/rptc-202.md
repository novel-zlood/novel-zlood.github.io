The final evolutionary stage of mobile phones that Lee Hyun-woo knows, the smartphone.

This wasn't the first time he mentioned it.

However, as the development of the PDA became visible, it seemed that the concept finally took root in Woo Sang-won's mind.

Woo Sang-won actually thought as follows:

‘Maybe when he talked about it several times, and I said it was impossible, he took it step by step.’

The meaning of taking it step by step here is simple.

After inserting an intermediate process, it was to incorporate the functions of a computer into the mobile phone that Lee Hyun-woo mentioned.

Since a PDA is practically a computer, it no longer seemed impossible.

Because of this, Lee Hyun-woo seemed even more amazing, and Woo Sang-won felt infinitely inadequate.

‘I still have a long way to go.’

He realized once again that managing a company well is not about handling tasks meticulously, always making a profit, and having no noise.

A manager must have a vision and constantly knock and challenge to ultimately produce results.

In that sense, he left the representative office and took out something he had given up on due to practical problems.

First, there is a web browser he completed a while ago.

Dedicated web browsers for the internet were almost monopolized by 【Macro Soft】, and several web browsers were rampant due to a few loyal users.

He thought there was no room to enter, so he decided not to release it to the world,

‘Come to think of it, I just lacked the courage.’

The feeling that it looked shabby compared to other web browsers.

Even now, when he clicked it, the shabby web browser caught his eye.

Various words came to his mind at that moment.

Among them,

【Jungle】's first dark history.

This was the story that came out in the meeting.

‘I am in a responsible position. That's why I'm the COO, the Chief Operating Officer, right?’

If he's criticized for the dark history, he thought he should accept it as it is.

Instead, he decided to take this web browser as a starting point and develop it into something better.

With this resolution, he called in Jung Kwang-yeol, the head of the portal site division, who had developed it together.

“Yes, Director.”

“You remember the web browser we developed back then, right?”

“Ah... yes... you mean Forest?”

“Yes, Forest.”

Since they were attaching a web browser name that suited the portal site 【Jungle】, Forest, meaning forest, came out.

“Let's apply it.”

“What? Really? Didn't you say it was too empty and not good?”

“If you look at it in a good way, the interface is simple.”

“Haha... you also said it lacked synchronization functions...”

“We can supplement it from now on. It seems we gave up midway because we tried to make it too perfect. Let's just apply it and accept the criticism. Then we can create a better version through feedback, right?”

“That... sounds good, but...”

“I'm serious, let's just do it.”

Nod, nod.

Seeing Woo Sang-won suddenly drop the honorific, Jung Kwang-yeol smiled and nodded.

“Okay. All in, no matter what!”

Actually, this web browser was conceived by these two when they were working together at 【Hi】.

They had worked hard on it for a long time, but when they saw the finished product, it felt like looking at the web browser with the same sentiment as Van Gogh cutting off his ear.

The difference between them and Van Gogh was that they didn’t cut off their ears.

Now that they decided to release it to the world with the resolve to cut off their ears, their minds felt lighter.

Soon after, a new notice appeared on the portal site.

- From September 1st, 【Jungle】's new web browser, Forest, will be introduced!

The content conveyed only the information, omitting any embellishments, just like the simplicity pursued by Forest.

* * *

Meanwhile, after touching on the concept of a smartphone, Lee Hyun-woo was busy looking at the companies participating in the 21st Century Venture Business Association after Woo Sang-won left.

Since the date was approaching, he was trying to review as many as possible.

‘I hope many good companies come this time.’

Son Jung-yi already mentioned he was planning to set up a fund.

He also said he would make a significant investment at this meeting.

This move was similar to what happened in his previous life.

‘Joe Murphy is also here.’

Joe Murphy, who had already come to Korea, was a slightly different case.

He was staying not for investment but to guide.

In other words, there were quite a few investors who trusted him from Wall Street, and he was planning to introduce Korean IT venture companies to them.

Because of this, he often visited 【Jungle】, and when he did, Lee Hyun-woo had to provide information.

That’s why he was memorizing various companies in his mind.

Sometimes he even contacted them directly.

One of the companies that caught his curiosity was found near the end of the workday.

【Internet Art Gallery】

As the name suggested, it seemed to be a site created to sell art pieces.

Would this really make money?

Lee Hyun-woo tilted his head and hesitated before dialing the number written.

‘A phone call won’t be enough. I should visit once.’

With this thought, he called, but no one answered.

The next day was the same.

Just in case, he contacted Chairman Jung Sung-woo.

(There are a lot of companies participating with just enthusiasm.)

“Yes?”

(Some companies only registered their business, and haven't even made a site yet.)

“Ah…”

(The association hired people for actual inspections, and some places were just their own homes.)

“I see.”

(Honestly, the government and foreign representatives are coming, but I don’t know if we should accept such people.)

“Investors make the judgment. And for your information, I also started at home in the beginning.”

Lee Hyun-woo's words were true.

So the person on the other side hurriedly replied.

(Oh, come to think of it... I had prejudices against people again.)

“No, it’s natural. Actually, I think the chairman of the association should be like that. I tend to be more idealistic, so I hope you lean more towards that side. Hahaha.”

* * *

Near the end of the workday, he tried to contact again.

Still, no answer.

“Hey, you need to answer the phone to create a booth.”

If he couldn’t reach them until the end, he would have to exclude them.

‘But strangely, I am drawn to it.’

He didn’t know why.

Obviously, it seemed like a site that wouldn’t make money, but his attention kept lingering.

‘Alright, let’s go there once. And check why my eyes keep going to this.’

With this thought, Lee Hyun-woo got up from his seat.

The location was near Hongwoo University, famous for its art.

When he finally arrived near the place, it wasn’t even a bustling area.

And finally, when he reached the door,

“Huh?”

Just by looking at it, it was a studio area, and the place where the person running 【Internet Art Gallery】 lived was also a studio.

‘Somehow, it seems like a college student.’

He made a rational guess at the place where the strange feeling led him.

Knock, knock.

He knocked on the door.

There was no answer.

Even after waiting for a long time, it was the same.

‘Was my hunch wrong?’

The reborn Lee Hyun-woo had a different attitude towards life.

He didn’t just seek paths with money and success, and sometimes he thought values other than money were important.

Maybe that attitude brought him here, but this time it seemed he had guessed wrong.

“Sigh…”

So he sighed and was about to turn around.

“Who is it?”

A voice came from behind.

Whip, he turned his head.

Maybe it was the cycle of meeting young faces lately, but this young man also looked almost like a boy.

“Ah... is this your home?”

“Yes, but who are you?”

However, he was a prickly boy.

“Well…”

“If you came because of debt, you got the wrong person. It’s my mother who owes debt. And my mother and I have been out of touch for a while.”

He seemed to have a quick temper.

So Lee Hyun-woo waited until the man finished speaking and then said,

“I am Lee Hyun-woo, an advisor at the 21st Century Venture Business Association.”

Originally, he was recommended to be the chairman, but he insisted on the advisor position to prevent his workaholic tendencies from spreading to the association.

“Oh?”

A surprised voice came from the other side’s mouth, and the pupils expanded as they examined Lee Hyun-woo closely.

“Lee Hyun-woo, the CEO?”

“Yes... I am an advisor at the association and a CEO at my company.”

“Oh... really... I made a mistake... really... I am sorry…”

“It’s alright. Hahaha.”

“I am really sorry. Ah, it’s embarrassing. I ended up talking about my family matters.”

“My memory isn’t good. My hearing isn’t great either. What did you say earlier?”

“Haha... it seems your acting skills aren’t great either?”

“I don’t have patience either. You won’t keep me standing out here, will you?”

“Oh... no! No! Wait a moment!”

The other person quickly used the key to open the studio.

Then, contrary to his expectations, a clean space came into view.

To be exact, it was closer to a workspace.

‘A workspace and living space.’

Lee Hyun-woo concluded internally and stepped into the studio.

“Oh, I didn’t even tell you my name. It’s Hwang Man.”

He already knew.

He confirmed it from the participating company information.

“Yes, Mr. Hwang.”

“Would you like some coffee?”

“No, just a glass of water, please.”

“Yes, here.”

After receiving the glass of water offered by the young man, Lee Hyun-woo began to satisfy his curiosity seriously.

“By the way, it seems you intend to mediate art pieces through the site, right?”

“Yes, that’s correct.”

“Can I hear more about it?”

“……”

For a moment, Hwang Man looked at Lee Hyun-woo intently.

“You... you’re serious, right?”

“Of course. Why?”

“Everyone treats me like a lunatic.”

“Why is that?”

“Of course... because they think I can’t make money with this site. Don’t you think so?”

This time, he asked Lee Hyun-woo with a slight hint of expectation in his voice.

Lee Hyun-woo immediately replied,

“I don’t know if you can make money or not.”

“Ah, yes…”

“To be more honest, the probability of not making money is much higher.”

“Ah, yes…”

Expectation turned into a voice of disappointment.

So Lee Hyun-woo thought more coldly.

‘I shouldn’t give false hope. That can be painful.’

It may seem cruel to be this harsh after coming here with a strange feeling, but for someone desperate for money, an early resignation might be the way.

But the other person, whether stubborn or foolish, asked this,

“Still, if I give up, it ends there, right?”

Evidence that he didn’t want to give up.

“Do you mean you want to keep going even if it doesn’t make money?”

“I’m the kind of person who has to touch it to know if it's poop or soybean paste.”

“Hahaha.”

An unexpectedly clear laugh burst out.

Then he said,

“Alright, let’s hear it. What do you intend to do with this site?”

That day, after listening to Hwang Man’s explanation for a long time, Lee Hyun-woo concluded,

‘It still won’t make money. But I want to help.’

Not out of sympathy.

Because the reborn Lee Hyun-woo’s values in life had changed.
