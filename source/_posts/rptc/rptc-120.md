Kim Yoon-seon was extremely nervous ahead of the album release.

Although all singers go through this process, this time it was the most intense.

She shouldn't feel this way, but Oh Jung-hwan, who was in charge of the arrangement, confidently said that the title track "Love Forgiven by Heaven" would be a big hit.

Today, even her manager Hyun Chang-soo said the same thing.

"Yoon-seon, with this album, you can prove to people that you're not done yet, right?"

"Oppa, aren't you expecting too much? Honestly... I'm a washed-up singer."

"What are you talking about? It's true that you've been struggling, but this song shows a fantastic transformation. Kim Yoon-seon reborn from a video singer to an audio singer!"

"No, it's not like we haven't tried this before... It just feels like we're floating aimlessly."

What Kim Yoon-seon said was true.

She had already declared herself an audio singer with a song that had a somewhat fast tempo in the past.

So, this time was almost the same as before.

"It's different this time. This is a complete ballad. And it touches on a taboo subject. Loving a friend's boyfriend, just hearing it is thrilling."

"I don't know."

"Just trust oppa. The album will sell like hotcakes. The digital tracks from Jungle Music will sell a lot too."

These days, it was fortunate for singers that there was Jungle Music.

It felt like a way to earn some extra income.

Of course, Hyun Chang-soo, who tended to exaggerate, interpreted it his way.

"You know there's a limit to producing tapes and CDs at the manufacturing plant, right?"

"That's what I heard. So, singers say it takes three weeks to adjust."

"Yeah, right. If this song becomes a hit, I'm going to request three weeks of production rights too."

"Oppa... Saying things like that makes me nervous."

"Ah, sorry, sorry! I won't say it anymore."

They were on their way to the 'comeback' stage.

So, Kim Yoon-seon couldn't help but look resentfully at the back of Hyun Chang-soo's head, who was driving.

The three-week production rights he mentioned were as follows.

For singers like Shin Sung-hoon, who sell their albums as soon as they are released, it means producing only one singer's album for three weeks to ensure smooth supply of tapes and CDs.

Because of this, certain singers or groups adjust their debut schedules.

For example, if Shin Sung-hoon releases an album at the beginning of March, Candy Boy debuts three weeks later, and DJ Brothers make their comeback three weeks after that.

Naturally, Kim Yoon-seon, a washed-up singer, did not fall into this category.

That's why Hyun Chang-soo, feeling even more prideful than Kim Yoon-seon, mentioned the three-week production rights.

'Still, oppa is right. It's fortunate that there's Jungle Music.'

As digital tracks began to be sold instead of physical albums, major singers and debuting singers always faced the problem of album supply.

Since only one singer's album was produced for three weeks, they had to use this gap.

However, the emergence of Jungle Music opened up a sales channel for such singers.

Kim Yoon-seon was still able to release a separate album, but some new singers were in a situation where they could only release digital tracks.

Several junior singers who greeted her in the waiting room seemed to be in the same situation.

"Did you see those kids who just passed by? They're a boy group called T-Bag, and they're debuting with digital tracks only."

"Ah, really?"

"Yeah, it looks like quite a few singers are starting out that way these days. Of course, they'll produce an album later, but the company feels less burdened if they release the digital tracks first and see the response."

"Should I have done that too?"

"Yoon-seon! Why are you so lacking in confidence? No, your song will be a big hit this time! I guarantee it."

The conversation went on in circles again.

Fortunately, perhaps due to Hyun Chang-soo's continued encouragement, Kim Yoon-seon was able to calm her mind and go out for the 'comeback' stage.

* * *

At that time, Lee Hyun-woo was watching TV with his family for the first time in a while.

It was also enjoyable to occasionally watch TV in the spacious living room with his parents and younger brother.

His parents seemed to feel the same way,

"Haha, we're living in comfort thanks to our sons. Who would've thought we could watch TV gathered in the living room of an apartment over 40 pyeong?"

"The old neighbors still keep in touch and say they're envious of our kids."

They would occasionally say such things.

But Lee Hyun-woo had no time to respond.

Because Kim Yoon-seon was about to appear.

"Oh? It's Kim Yoon-seon."

His younger brother, Lee Jung-woo, called out her name and looked at his older brother.

It seemed he was interested because she had a connection with Jungle and was a celebrity friend of his brother.

His parents, who knew the story, felt the same way.

"I hope Kim Yoon-seon does well too."

"Yeah, I haven't seen her sing in a while."

At that moment,

Kim Yoon-seon's song started playing on TV.

Lee Hyun-woo focused all his auditory senses to listen to her song.

The live music program indicated at the top right corner whether it was live or lip-synced, and it was clear that it was live.

"Wow… She sings well."

"Indeed. I thought she was just good at dancing, but she sings well too."

"Mom, Dad, please be a bit quieter."

His younger brother put a finger to his lips, indicating that he didn't want to be disturbed while listening.

So, they could listen to Kim Yoon-seon's song without further interruptions.

'Is the broadcast different? It's much better than when I heard it in the studio last time.'

So, he felt excited.

And earlier, when he saw the digital track on Jungle Music, the reaction was just so-so, which made him root for her even more.

After the song ended, his parents and younger brother each gave positive reviews.

"Wow, this song is really good."

"I think it's the best song I've heard recently."

"Nowadays, it's all male singers and mixed groups, but finally, a proper female solo singer has emerged."

His younger brother's last comment was slightly misleading.

Kim Yoon-seon had always been a female solo singer. She hadn't just emerged.

It was probably because Kim Yoon-seon was challenging the unfamiliar ballad genre that he said that.

"Hyung, this song is going to sell well, right?"

"Will it?"

"People who watch this broadcast will definitely download it. Anyway, since they can download individual tracks, it's less of a burden."

This was also a reason for Jungle Music's recent success.

People no longer had to buy tapes costing over 5,000 won or CDs costing about 10,000 won and listen to all the bundled songs.

Now, they could listen to only the songs they wanted.

"The music industry is going to change significantly in the future. No, I hear it's already changing. They're reducing the preparation period for songs and releasing a few tracks focused on digital releases, not albums."

"I didn't know that."

Listening to the story, Lee Hyun-woo also widened his eyes.

If this were to happen, it would not only bring forward the future but also create a new market.

'Whatever the case, that's a story for the distant future.'

For now, he was very curious about how popular Kim Yoon-seon's song would become.

* * *

The results came out the next day.

From midnight until now, "Love Forgiven by Heaven" had topped the digital charts.

Since Jungle Music's sales were increasing, being number one meant a significant increase in revenue.

Lee Hyun-woo immediately called her.

(Yes, this is Kim Yoon-seon's phone.)

"Oh, Manager Hyun."

(Ah, is that you, CEO Lee?)

"Is Yoon-seon busy?"

(She's in the middle of an interview right now. Hahaha.)

Judging by his voice, he seemed very satisfied.

Of course, as a manager, he wouldn't have missed checking Jungle Music.

(We always appreciate you, CEO.)

"There's nothing to appreciate. It's all because Yoon-seon did well."

(But this song was composed by you, CEO... Ah, I'm sorry.)

Seemingly forgetting to keep it a secret, Hyun Chang-soo blurted it out and quickly apologized.

'I wonder if this secret can be kept.'

Thinking this, Lee Hyun-woo said,

"Please tell Yoon-seon to contact me when she gets a chance. If she's too busy, just let her know it was a congratulatory call."

(Of course, she'll call. Oh? Hold on. It looks like the interview just ended.)

Kim Yoon-seon then took over the call.

(Hello? Hyun-woo?)

"Oh, yes. I just wanted to give you some encouragement and congratulations, but your manager..."

(Yeah, that oppa can be a bit much. Please understand.)

"It's not that bad. Anyway, congratulations on the number one digital track."

(It's all thanks to you.)

"Ah, let's not say that anymore. I heard your manager mention it earlier too. Please be thorough in keeping it a secret. Okay?"

(Oh... okay...)

Her response sounded a bit doubtful, but he ended the call there.

And a few days later, an article came out from the place where Kim Yoon-seon had given an interview.

"‘Love Forgiven by Heaven,’ has a different actual composer."

* * *

He had a feeling this would happen, and indeed it was exposed.

'At least my name wasn't mentioned.'

Kim Yoon-seon repeatedly called to apologize.

Each time, Lee Hyun-woo told her it was okay and asked her to ensure that his name would never be revealed.

He made this request several times.

Given Kim Yoon-seon's personality, it was easy to imagine reporters coaxing the secret out of her.

It seemed that was how it got exposed this time too.

'Still, I absolutely hate troublesome situations.'

However, they say that once more than two people know, it's no longer a secret.

With Kim Yoon-seon, her manager, and the arranger all aware, it seemed like it would eventually be revealed.

Lee Hyun-woo thought he should be fully prepared for that.

'Still, it's fortunate that the song is doing well.'

Kim Yoon-seon's new song continued to hold the number one spot for several days.

The cumulative downloads had exceeded 600,000.

At 300 won per track, the sales had already surpassed 180 million won.

And that was just for "Love Forgiven by Heaven." As this song sold, the other songs in Kim Yoon-seon's album also began selling, and her old songs started to climb back up the charts.

This happened in just a few days, bringing Lee Hyun-woo's earlier words closer to reality.

'I really hope more singers in our country can earn as much as Michael Jackson.'

Moreover, music is a universal language, and once this content spreads, it can change the world.

Especially, Lee Hyun-woo felt that he could bring forward the Korean Wave.

He had already heard from Woo Sang-won that many people from Hong Kong and Taiwan were connecting to Jungle.

"Clonez and Kim Yoon-seon are very popular in those two countries. Recently, Candy Boy is the same. Although the download speed isn't fast, I heard from Team Leader Kang Dong-ho that people click to download and then do other things while waiting."

Kang Dong-ho was conducting market research and looking for intermediary companies to enter the Hong Kong and Taiwan markets.

It seemed like the news he heard while traveling to and from those two countries for business.

"What about payment?"

"Currently, only credit cards are accepted. So, it seems urgent to establish business cooperation with telecom companies in Taiwan and Hong Kong, so they can charge through phone bills."

Lee Hyun-woo nodded, showing a pleased expression.

'If it's already at this level, we can make a lot of money with just a music platform.'
