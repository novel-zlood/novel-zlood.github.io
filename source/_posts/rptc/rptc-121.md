Lee Hyun-woo suddenly thought of 【Pineapple】's 'Ytunes.'

The MP3 file originated from Germany, and the MP3 player came from Korea, but the place that made the most money by utilizing both was 【Pineapple】.

Furthermore, it expanded beyond music to movies and media content, becoming the foundation for 'Ypod' and 'Yphone,' essentially laying the cornerstone for the 【Pineapple】 empire.

'Could I do the same?'

It's not impossible.

No, he could visualize it by unleashing his imagination.

If 【Jungle Music】, a global music hub, evolved into a colossal online market selling movies and media content, the dream of a 【Jungle】 empire wouldn't be far-fetched.

'Yes, I'll be able to smile contentedly watching that after I retire, right?'

However, he must remember that there's still a long way to go.

The biggest challenge was the download speeds in each country.

Fortunately, the U.S. was launching high-speed internet services, and Japan was showing interest through Son Jung-yi.

Although there hadn't been an official announcement in Japan yet, the next day Lee Hyun-woo heard the news through foreign media.

『【Jungle】 joins hands with 【Software Bank】 to provide high-speed internet in Japan!』

A different kind of excitement welled up.

If last year they relied on Son Jung-yi and 【Software Bank】's fame, now they were in a position of mutual win-win.

Oh Min-woo loudly proclaimed during a meeting that 【Jungle】 was the best.

"Son Jung-yi is a very lucky man. If it were now, we would have chosen our partners, but back then, we had no choice, right?"

"That's right. Son Jung-yi and 【Software Bank】 were already there in front of 【Jungle】, so people went 'Wow' and paid attention. So, partnering with Son Jung-yi to enter Japan itself was like promoting ourselves."

"It seems like it will soon be the opposite. As you know, if a portal site called 【Jungle】 appears in Japan, Son Jung-yi will want to introduce online shopping and music services quickly."

"When that time comes, let's not do business at a loss like now, but start by confidently taking big money."

As the company grew, so did the thoughts, perspectives, and dreams of the team leaders.

If he were to retire someday, he could trust them to leave the company.

'Yes, grow well.'

* * *

Whether it was Lee Hyun-woo's wish or Oh Min-woo's geeky nature taking another detour.

"CEO, I've come up with something amazing again."

He kept creating new things.

Why was he excited?

Lee Hyun-woo smiled and asked him.

"What is it this time?"

"A simple payment service."

"What?"

Lee Hyun-woo's eyes widened to the size of coins.

His drooping eyelids were almost invisible.

It was inevitable since what Oh Min-woo mentioned was a payment method that would only be realized decades later.

"I heard that people in Taiwan and Hong Kong are also paying for 【Jungle Music】 downloads? So I thought about other methods besides credit cards."

"And?"

"If we use the simple payment system I've devised, it's like we've entered the credit card market."

"No, what principle is it based on?"

"Shall I explain?"

"Huh? Um..."

Lee Hyun-woo hesitated for a moment.

He thought he wouldn't understand even if he heard it.

However, one thing was certain,

'Come to think of it, there was a simple payment system called 'Paypals' in my past life.'

Surprisingly, it was something Elon Musk, the man who later became the CEO of an electric car company, created with developers in his youth.

He remembered it was around 1998 or 1999.

If he could advance high-speed internet, there was no reason he couldn't advance this as well.

However,

"Technically, it's impressive that you've developed it. But there will be many obstacles to actual use."

"Yes, that's why I'm here to tell you directly, CEO."

A system that allows payments to be made easily is good.

However, if not handled properly, it could lead to double or even triple currency exchanges, making the costs outweigh the benefits.

"There will be issues with currency exchange, and regulations will make it difficult. So let's shelve it for now."

"Yes, CEO. And I'll make sure to inform you whenever I start developing something new."

"Okay, good."

Watching him leave, Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

He could roughly guess Oh Min-woo's motivation for development.

He probably approached it thinking that easier payments would allow 【Jungle】's content to spread more widely.

'Technologies or ideas ahead of their time keep emerging...'

He couldn't help but feel regretful as the environment wasn't supportive.

At least Lee Hyun-woo was working hard to create an IT ecosystem.

Not just in Korea, but globally, he was building high-speed internet infrastructure.

* * *

Maybe due to Lee Hyun-woo's efforts, a few days later, Kang Dong-ho returned from a business trip to Hong Kong with results.

"We've partnered with a telecom company in Hong Kong. Now, when people download songs from 【Jungle Music】, they'll be billed through their phone charges and settle it later."

"Thank you for your hard work."

Before going to Hong Kong, he had visited Taiwan.

Next month, Lee Hyun-woo himself planned to push forward in Japan, so global sales of 【Jungle Music】 seemed imminent.

"CEO, while we're at it, let's release a press release to the media. That way, there won't be any backlash from agencies and companies."

"Let's do that."

Kang Dong-ho also seemed to be growing rapidly.

The reason for announcing it through the media was simple.

【Jungle】 was working hard to sell Korean pop music overseas!

This would make choosing MP3s a decision without regret!

Indeed, a related article came out shortly after.

『Path open to download 【Jungle Music】 songs in Hong Kong and Taiwan!』

『Korean pop music, finally conquering Asia?』

『Singers sitting on a pile of money as downloads increase in Hong Kong and Taiwan』

Although the articles were highly exaggerated, the music industry and agencies praised 【Jungle】 immensely when such articles came out.

This was something Lee Hyun-woo heard while talking to Kim Yoon-sun.

* * *

(These days, when I go to waiting rooms, they seem to talk about you the most.)

"Oh, come on, that can't be."

(Really. They say life is enjoyable because of 【Jungle Music】. Not just in waiting rooms, music industry people want to bow when they meet you. Isn't it true that you also settle the background music on blogs?)

Since Kim Yoon-sun wasn't good at embellishing, her words were trustworthy.

Lee Hyun-woo responded with a broad smile.

"Then I shouldn't meet those people. How old am I to receive bows?"

(It's just a figure of speech.)

"Okay, thanks anyway. By the way, can you make some time around summer?"

(Summer? Why?)

"I'm going to Taiwan and Hong Kong. It looks like those two countries will have high-speed internet around that time."

It's true.

And this was information Kang Dong-ho provided after visiting both countries.

Therefore,

"We should enter Taiwan and Hong Kong too."

There was a moment of silence over the phone.

Kim Yoon-sun's blank expression was easy to imagine.

She clearly needed time to process the information.

Her voice, mixed with surprise, came from the other end.

(Wow, my jaw is dropping. I read in the newspaper recently that you're also entering Japan.)

"Yes, that's right. Business needs to be pursued simultaneously."

(I see. But why do you want me to go with you?)

"What do you think? It's because you're incredibly popular in those two countries."

(You really exaggerate when you compliment me.)

"So you're saying you exaggerated earlier too. Haha."

After laughing lightly, Lee Hyun-woo revealed his purpose.

"We're planning concerts with popular singers in Taiwan and Hong Kong."

(What? Really?)

"Yes. While holding the concerts, we'll naturally promote our company. Before that, can you appear on Taiwan and Hong Kong TV programs?"

(Ah, you want me to promote 【Jungle】.)

"Yes, exactly."

(Your company must be making a lot of money. Concerts require quite a bit of money, right?)

"We do make a lot, but we spend it as soon as we earn it. That's the biggest problem. Still, we have to invest where it's needed. We're going to conquer Taiwan and Hong Kong with popular Korean singers like you, Clones, and Candyboy."

As he spoke, he already felt excited.

'I must attend this concert.'

* * *

It was clear that pushing this forward alone would be expensive for 【Jungle】.

So the next day.

Lee Hyun-woo visited 【Aejung Cosmetics】.

Although he had called ahead, Choi Sun-hwa greeted him with a surprised expression, as if she didn't expect him to actually come.

"What brings you here?"

"Why, am I not allowed to come here?"

"It's not that."

"I was wondering if 【Aejung Cosmetics】 has any export plans."

"Export plans? How did you know?"

"I heard that foreign tourists coming to Korea are buying your cosmetics in heaps."

Although there was some exaggeration, Choi Sun-hwa didn't completely deny it.

"They say there's some reaction in the Chinese-speaking region. As you mentioned, some people have started buying our cosmetics in bulk to sell."

If K-pop was rising, K-beauty wouldn't be lagging behind.

Although it's in its nascent stage now, the scale of the fruits reaped later would be astonishing.

Thinking this, Lee Hyun-woo suggested.

"If you're planning to enter the market, you need to start marketing, right?"

"Of course."

"Let's do it together."

"With you guys?"

"Yes, with us. We're also planning to enter Taiwan and Hong Kong."

"When?"

"After summer?"

"Wow, that's similar to our timeline."

"I thought so and came to see you."

It's a lie. If it was later, he would persuade them to do it earlier, and if it was earlier, he planned to piggyback on it.

"How about marketing through concerts?"

"Concerts?"

"We'll set the stage for our popular singers in that region. It probably won't be hard to get on TV."

Finally understanding the intent behind Lee Hyun-woo's proposal, Choi Sun-hwa spoke with a tone of disbelief.

"So you came to ask for sponsorship for the concert?"

"No, it's to do marketing together…."

"Come on, it's clearly sponsorship. 【Jungle】 will host, and other companies will join, right?"

"Um, caught me?"

"Where else are you going? 【Seorabeol Hotel】?"

"Yes, I'm going there too, and later I'll stop by 【Software Bank】 in Japan for some sponsorship."

Choi Sun-hwa opened her mouth in astonishment.

Then, shaking her head as if in resignation, she said,

"Fine, fine. I'll sponsor it."

"Good decision. Let me tell you in advance, you're lucky. Later, you might not get a chance even if you want to."

"Later? You mean this isn't a one-time thing?"

"I'm planning to do it every year."

"What?"

"This year, it's named '1997 Jungle Festival.' Next year, of course, it will be 1998."

"Wow… I'm really curious about the end of your challenges."

"Want me to tell you more? I'm planning to expand the concert's scale. So, I'll bring singers from various Asian countries onto the stage. Then, I'll sell their songs through 【Jungle Music】. Eventually, the goal is to target the entire world. Naturally, I'll bring singers from all over the world onto the stage."

If you're going to dream, dream big.

"I might even have to do it twice next year. The year-end event will be the 【Jungle Music Awards】, a music awards ceremony."

Lee Hyun-woo smiled at Choi Sun-hwa, who looked at him with an exasperated expression.

'In my past life, the representative Korean music site did such things, you know.'

Lee Hyun-woo was just bringing it forward significantly.
