Lee Hyun-woo's assurance that he wouldn't let him taste failure made Kim Yoon-soo laugh.

It was because he felt an indescribable emotion listening to Lee Hyun-woo, who was more than ten years older than him.

‘It’s not something to believe blindly. I tried not to be fooled again.’

But in the end, a gullible person remains a gullible person.

“Then I’ll trust you and take a leap!”

“Go ahead. Do it! I’ll help you!”

Although it wasn’t a decision to be made at a drinking party, Kim Yoon-soo, caught up in the mood of the day, made a quick judgment.

Of course, he got incredibly drunk later.

He got so drunk that his tongue twisted, and he kept repeating his words with unclear pronunciation.

“I… I… will… put up… the shop… for sale tomorrow!”

“Go ahead! I’ll help you!”

What can’t be said at a drinking party?

Lee Hyun-woo was also on the verge of losing it.

‘But I can’t lose my senses too.’

After shaking his head a few times to regain his composure, he barely stood up.

“Boss, let’s go home now!”

“Just! One! More cup!”

“Yes, yes. Then let’s leave here.”

“Okay, okay. Got it.”

Of course, he had no intention of drinking more.

He planned to take him out of the bar, grab a taxi, and send him home.

So, he quickly paid the bill and supported the almost limp Kim Yoon-soo to stand up.

But Kim Yoon-soo, with his feet firmly planted on the ground, didn’t budge and started speaking in a twisted voice again.

“You are a madman.”

“Why the sudden insult….”

“And you must have been a problem child. A rebel who couldn’t adapt to the environment. Am I right?”

Although Lee Hyun-woo had never lived such a life, how could he argue with a drunk person?

“Yes, yes. You’re right.”

“I knew it. That’s why you see the world differently. That’s why the world doesn’t acknowledge and embrace you.”

Even though he was drunk, he said some strange things as if he had read some book somewhere.

But the content was logical enough to make Lee Hyun-woo chuckle.

However, while taking him outside, the words he kept shouting in his ear made Lee Hyun-woo feel embarrassed.

“So, you are a crazy genius. You do enough crazy things to change the world.”

“Yes, yes. You’re right.”

To soothe him, he had no choice but to repeat the same words.

Just then.

As soon as they stepped outside, Lee Hyun-woo subtly sensed that someone was waiting.

Someone in a black suit was looking at them coldly.

Unexpectedly, Kim Yoon-soo, with his bleary eyes, recognized the person in the black suit.

“Huh? Isn’t that Secretary Kang?”

“You’ve had a lot to drink.”

“Did my father send you?”

“I’ll take you home.”

The person called Secretary Kang avoided giving a precise answer and spoke to Lee Hyun-woo.

In the end, he had no choice but to hand him over.

“I! Need to drink! More!”

In the end, Kim Yoon-soo, shouting loudly, got into the car with the support of Secretary Kang.

Seeing that, Lee Hyun-woo chuckled.

‘He sure is living the good life.’

Unlike him, Kim Yoon-soo, born with a silver spoon, would have less to worry about even if his business failed, right?

No, it couldn’t be.

If he failed, 【Jungle】, his partner, would also be affected.

With this thought, Lee Hyun-woo muttered to himself.

“Absolutely not. It will work out! Ah, I’m getting drunk.”

Was he actually getting drunk?

Lee Hyun-woo quickly covered his mouth and hailed a taxi.

On the way back, he pondered over what Kim Yoon-soo had said.

Doing enough crazy things to change the world?

‘That sounds interesting.’

A mischievous smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo’s lips.

* * *

The next day, when he woke up, his head throbbed with a hangover.

“Ugh…”

It was already nine o’clock when he came out of his room.

He saw Jang Yoo-chul, who had already gone to work early, and Lee Jung-woo made a comment when he saw his brother.

“It’s the first time I’ve seen you drink so much. Are you starting to resemble me these days?”

“Really?”

“Who did you drink with?”

“President Kim Yoon-soo.”

“I knew it. What business were you discussing this time?”

Now, whenever Lee Hyun-woo met someone outside, even if it was at a drinking party, it seemed like it was always about business.

He admitted it. Even though he kept saying ‘work-life balance’ with his mouth after his return, wasn’t he living a life focused solely on work again?

‘I need to change that perception when I have more leisure later.’

It wasn’t to show someone.

It was just because he genuinely wanted to achieve work-life balance in this life.

The ‘crazy things to change the world’ that Kim Yoon-soo talked about the previous day included that as well.

Lee Hyun-woo decided to provide work-life balance not only for himself but also for all the employees of 【Jungle】.

With this mindset, he told his brother and Jang Yoo-chul about what happened with Kim Yoon-soo.

“Wow, really… I’ve heard it from Jung-woo, but I think you’re truly a genius, hyung.”

“I hate to admit it, but I guess I’ll always live being compared to my genius brother.”

“Come on. I’m not a genius. If anything, I just worked hard.”

“What are you talking about? You were called a prodigy and a genius since you were young, and later you proved to be a genius and a top student through your studies. Didn’t you even enter school as the top student?”

“I just studied mechanically.”

“Who didn’t?”

“Stop it, it’s embarrassing….”

Anyway, Lee Hyun-woo’s pager rang, interrupting the conversation.

He checked it, and it was Kim Yoon-soo again, just like yesterday.

“Why is he calling early in the morning?”

Maybe he was so embarrassed by the words he said the previous day that he wanted to take them back.

“Is it President Kim Yoon-soo?”

“Yes.”

“Maybe he decided on the assembly PC company and is calling to inform you?”

“No way…”

“Maybe his soul was drained after talking to you. Your persuasive power is no joke.”

“No, it’s probably because he regrets what he said drunkenly yesterday. I need to persuade him slowly.”

“Then hyung, if he seems hesitant, tell him you’ll provide assembly personnel.”

“What?”

“Our club members. They are dying to get part-time jobs. They are very envious of Yoo-chul and me.”

“Yes, Jung-woo is right.”

Lee Hyun-woo nodded at their words.

‘Indeed, college students would frequently use our 【Jungle】.’

How envious they would be if they heard that they were creating, operating, and managing this website.

They might even admire it.

“Alright. I’ll talk to him about it.”

Naturally, it seemed better to deliver this content in person rather than over the phone.

So, Lee Hyun-woo immediately went to see Kim Yoon-soo.

But.

“What? You already put up your shop for sale?”

“I make decisions quickly, you see.”

Even though he knew Kim Yoon-soo was impulsive, he thought it would take some time, but it was as quick as lightning.

Lee Hyun-woo’s face turned to one of astonishment.

‘He really makes quick decisions. Is this a characteristic of impulsive people?’

Or perhaps a trait of those who grew up wealthy.

Though he still wore a bewildered smile, just as he thought before, this was a shortcut to a win-win situation.

He didn’t even want to tell him to think it over carefully one more time.

Instead, he decided to match the speed of the other party’s quick decision and began to discuss the business specifics.

“Then you’ll need personnel to assemble the computers, right?”

“I was thinking of asking some people from the Seun Sangga (electronics market), what do you think?”

Lee Hyun-woo immediately waved his hand.

“Oh, don’t do that.”

“Why?”

“If those people were suited for this, they would’ve gotten jobs long ago.”

“Is that so? But I don’t know anyone else.”

Now, Lee Hyun-woo spoke the words he had planned.

“I have someone.”

“Really?”

“Yes, my brother is majoring in computer science. He assembled a computer and servers with the parts he bought here last time.”

“Oh, he’s skilled.”

“He’s quite good. I’ll ask him to gather his classmates and club friends.”

“But can college students work in a factory for low wages?”

“At first, we’ll rely on them, and since assembly is a simple task, we’ll gradually hire people and train them.”

“Ah…”

“Even if it’s a simple task, you can’t do it without knowing about computers. We need to train them thoroughly to work.”

“That’s obvious.”

“I don’t think you can handle that, can you? Are you good at managing people?”

“Hmm? Well… I suppose I should.”

Yeah right. He had failed several businesses already.

Thinking this to himself, Lee Hyun-woo decided he had to step in and help until things settled.

This was also based on experience.

‘Living life twice has many advantages.’

Honestly, Lee Hyun-woo had visited many computer assembly factories in his previous life.

Working at a trading company meant experiencing all sorts of industries, and he had visited many assembly factories as well.

He still remembered the nickname his boss had given him back then.

【In this field, knowing things lightly, shallowly, and broadly is the key to success. But why do you want to know things so deeply?】

It was, of course, because of his personality.

Whatever he did, he dug to the end.

That helped him in his job, and he eventually got promoted ahead of the senior who had said those words.

Even at that time, people called him a genius, but looking back, it was the result of work addiction.

Anyway, he was confident in the new business venture.

After finishing all the discussions and stepping out of 【Won PC】, Lee Hyun-woo looked at the impulsive Kim Yoon-soo once more.

‘I’ll make sure you don’t regret your quick decision.’

Moreover, he would show the rewards for trusting his words as soon as possible.

With this determination, Lee Hyun-woo walked home with a spring in his step.

* * *

Right after returning home, Lee Hyun-woo asked his brother, Lee Jung-woo, for a favor.

“Do you remember the club friends you mentioned before? We need their help.”

“What? Already?”

“Yes, President Kim Yoon-soo has put up the shop for sale.”

Lee Jung-woo made the same astonished face as Lee Hyun-woo earlier.

Then he smiled broadly.

“Why are you so happy?”

“As I said in the morning, those guys are extremely envious of Yoo-chul and me. They are dying to experience this kind of part-time job, so they’ll see me as a savior.”

“Geez…”

“Honestly, this is something you can’t buy with money. Who would get a chance to run a website and do business directly? Only a genius like you would take on such a challenge.”

“Yes, only someone like you, hyung. So, I’m really lucky. This experience is immensely valuable later.”

“Anyway, gather your friends and get them into the PC assembly factory. There won’t be any problem, right?”

“Of course! There are plenty of guys who would jump at the chance. Right, Yoo-chul?”

“They’ll love it.”

Lee Hyun-woo nodded at the words of Lee Jung-woo and Jang Yoo-chul.

By the way, these guys attended the renowned engineering school, 【Wangsibri University】.

Perhaps because of that, they seemed to welcome part-time jobs related to computers or information technology.

‘Then, we just need to recruit and train the staff and get started.’

That was that, and they also needed to prepare for a new phase in the 【Jungle】 website work.

“Ah, and there’s something we need to do.”

“What is it?”

“We need to sell products directly without going through auctions. It’s a kind of Internet shopping. We plan to sell the PCs assembled in the factory directly to consumers online.”

Since they had successfully established the 【eBase】 model, it was time to move towards 【Amazones】.
