Lee Hyun-woo brought up the topic of AI, and his younger brother Lee Jung-woo took it up, leading to the development of a game.

‘Things really don’t go my way, huh.’

Although he thought this, it was fun.

Originally, Lee Hyun-woo wanted to proceed with an AlphaGo-like project through an AI Go player in 【Single】.

However, this direction wasn’t bad either, so he plans to just watch and see.

Post-it notes were also an accidental invention during the super-adhesive project process, and the microwave emerged unexpectedly while developing new radar technology.

This online Go game in life might also start unexpectedly like this.

‘At least one thing that’s going my way is the resilient Korean economy, I suppose?’

In fact, recently, the Korean economy was holding its own to some extent.

The Thai foreign exchange crisis spread to neighboring countries, affecting Hong Kong and Taiwan as it moved east.

『Is the information and communication sector of the Korean industry rapidly shifting?』

South Korea was offsetting the crisis due to rapid growth in the IT sector.

However, after a few large companies went bankrupt and unemployed people increased, the situation wasn’t good on one side.

This part was heard from Choi Sun-hwa a few days before leaving for Taiwan and Hong Kong.

“You know, the situation in the industry isn’t good because of the 【Domipa Department Store】 bankruptcy. If it weren’t for fashion and cosmetics, mom was sighing that it could have been a big problem.”

“The distribution side is temporarily struggling.”

“It’s being restructured in its own way. But we’re in a slightly better position. The atmosphere in Taiwan and Hong Kong is gloomy.”

“Yeah, I saw it on the news too.”

“I don’t know if the Asian economy will sink completely.”

“It’s a situation where we can’t predict even a step ahead.”

“A crisis is an opportunity, right? Aren’t you guys doing well?”

“Well, we’re the same as always.”

“You mean you’re doing well as usual?”

It was hard to deny, so Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

Honestly, all profit figures for online auctions, shopping, portal sites, music services, and cloud services were soaring.

It was the same overseas.

Since 【Jungle Japan】 and 【Jungle USA】 were also realizing profits, the expectations for the third quarter could be higher.

【Jungle】, which started as a small snowball, was now gaining a significant area with each roll.

Even this area seemed likely to expand further.

“We are looking forward to expanding into Taiwan and Hong Kong in the second half.”

“Well, you never know. We could spend money and fail miserably. You can’t be sure about anything. That’s why I keep asking for your help.”

The help Lee Hyun-woo requested was simple.

It was to use the organizational strength of 【Aejeong Cosmetics】, which had successfully entered Hong Kong and Taiwan, to enter those two places.

He had already asked for this part before, and after Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho traveled back and forth between Hong Kong and Taiwan to receive cooperation, they were finally on the verge of entering.

“Has it really been helpful? According to Manager Han, the preparations are almost complete…”

“Yes, it has been very helpful. We were able to secure local developers and other personnel using your branch organization.”

“So, 【Jungle Taiwan】 and 【Jungle Hong Kong】 will be established soon.”

“Well, it seems so.”

And for these two places to be properly known, the concert that had been prepared was important.

This information could be received directly from Han Se-jin in the company.

“It seems that all the singers who are very popular in the Chinese-speaking world have been recruited. This includes Clones and Kim Yoon-sun, whom you know well.”

“What about Absolute Pitch?”

“Yes, they are included. But they will be extremely busy due to a sudden schedule in the US.”

“Really? They have a US schedule?”

“Yes, it’s not known to the media yet, but it seems they will appear on an American show.”

It seems that Macaroni is becoming known in the US faster than expected.

The reason was simple.

“Due to the popularity of the P2P site you were worried about, Macaroni is experiencing a strange phenomenon of success.”

“Ah…”

“So, even the CEO doesn’t know how to react. It’s good that the songs are becoming popular quickly, but it seems that illegal music sharing will reduce revenue.”

This was also an anticipated point.

The proliferation of P2P has both positive and negative effects.

If P2P sites also appear in our country, a war over intellectual property rights would be inevitable.

We are preparing hard for this, like mushrooms growing rapidly after the rain.

“Moreover, P2P sites are continuously appearing in the US.”

It was spreading rapidly.

“There’s nothing we can do. We can only continue to prepare countermeasures. Now, let’s finish the preparations well and promote it properly this time.”

“Yes, CEO. Ah, and there is one more thing to report.”

“……”

“It seems like 【Yahoo】 will launch a portal site in Taiwan before us.”

Perhaps feeling it was a pity to report this now, it seemed like he deliberately saved this for last.

Then Lee Hyun-woo nodded with a smile.

“It was expected. Personally, I see it as a good opportunity.”

“Pardon?”

“Isn’t it motivating? We’ve always been the first to seize the market and watched others follow. This time, it’s a chance to show that it doesn’t matter if they go first.”

Lee Hyun-woo was someone who never lost his confidence and composure.

This expression was also imprinted on Han Se-jin’s face, who had been learning from him.

“Of course. Whether we are the first or the followers, we will show that no one can compete with 【Jungle】.”

With a determined voice, Han Se-jin made a vow.

Coincidentally, 【Yahoo】 planned to launch during 【Jungle】’s promotional period, so they would show them a harsh lesson.

Seeing that resolve, the smile on Lee Hyun-woo’s face deepened.

* * *

However, at this time, 【Yahoo】’s entry into Taiwan could be seen as somewhat intentional.

At the same time Lee Hyun-woo received the report from Han Se-jin, 【Yahoo】’s CEO Jaime Yang was receiving an explanation from her secretary.

“Entering Japan was smooth with Son Jung-yi and in the US through collaboration with 【AltaVista】 and investment from 【Natural Standard Fund】, but Hong Kong and Taiwan don’t have clear business partners. Therefore, 【Jungle】 is planning a concert in Taiwan and Hong Kong in line with the recent Hallyu trend.”

Jaime Yang, who has Taiwanese blood, and her secretary, who is also of Taiwanese immigrant descent, were well aware of the rising significance of Hallyu in the Chinese-speaking world.

Jaime Yang nodded, having heard several explanations about Hallyu.

“But it’s quite coincidental that we are launching 【Yahoo Taiwan】 at that time?”

“Precisely, we moved it up a bit.”

“Right. It’s better to rain on 【Jungle】’s promotional period.”

“It seems the strategy of consistently inquiring with market research firms to review the entry environment has worked.”

The secretary’s words were true.

Fortunately, it was a well-prepared environment for information and communication to thrive, but the sudden competitor, 【Jungle】, complicated Jaime Yang’s mind.

That company had even dominated the Japanese market following the Korean market.

Seeing how 【Yahoo】 had double the portal market share in the US, it was clear how important the first-mover advantage was.

Naturally, 【Yahoo】 quickly pushed forward with the strategy to avoid repeating this in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

‘Still, 【Jungle】 prepared much faster than I expected.’

She thought 【Jungle Taiwan】 would come out around the end of the year, but seeing the concert plans, it was clear the site launch had been moved up.

“So, assuming we are the first to seize the market, what are the variables? Is there any analysis?”

“We should be cautious of 【Jungle】’s search function.”

“Hmm…”

Jaime Yang let out a hum.

The reason 【Jungle】 was rapidly rising in the US was precisely this search technology.

【Jungle】’s search engine had unparalleled accuracy.

Although Jaime Yang encouraged the development team to enhance 【Yahoo】’s search engine, it was still clearly different.

Now, the only hope was the first-mover advantage.

And.

‘If we surpass Taiwan and Hong Kong, China will be next.’

Soon, a bridgehead for entering a larger market would be established.

* * *

On the day of departure to Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The airport was filled with familiar faces for Lee Hyun-woo.

There were nearly twenty employees from 【Jungle】 alone.

Soon after, Choi Sun-hwa arrived and asked Lee Hyun-woo.

“Why are so many people going?”

“Ah, it’s also a workshop.”

“A workshop?”

“Yeah. From now on, our employees will frequently have overseas workshops. But since not everyone can go, I plan to take them in turns.”

Choi Sun-hwa had heard about 【Jungle】’s workshops before.

No, she met Lee Hyun-woo during the first workshop, so the word was imprinted in her mind.

“Didn’t you have it in Jeju Island last time?”

“Yeah, that’s right. Jeju Island is practically overseas. You have to cross the sea. Hahaha.”

“Wow, you really treat your employees well.”

At that moment, unable to hold back, Han Se-jin chimed in.

“I haven’t worked at other companies, so I’m not sure, but I dare say it’s the best in the industry. The CEO treats us very well.”

“Manager Han, saying that where I can hear…”

“……”

“It makes me feel good, so I want to treat you even better. Hahaha.”

In fact, stories about 【Jungle】’s employee welfare had spread widely.

Employees occasionally posted on their blogs, and although its credibility was questionable, there were posts on 【Rumors】 as well.

Recently, it was heard that the annual salary was comparable to large corporations, so naturally, talents were flocking in.

“I guess I need to reflect too? We should also do our best for employee welfare. Like having overseas workshops like 【Jungle】. I’ll have to ask Ah-young when she arrives if a workshop at the Jeju Island hotel is possible.”

As if a tiger appeared when mentioned, soon Kim Ah-young arrived.

She approached with a bright smile, accompanied by secretaries and bodyguards, and handed something to Choi Sun-hwa.

“What’s this?”

“An MP3 phone.”

“Ah, this is the one I saw at the exhibition.”

“Yes. And it will be released in Korea tomorrow. I brought it because I thought you might get bored on the plane. I put a few songs on it.”

“Thanks. But what about Hyun-woo?”

“Hyun-woo already has one.”

Right then, Lee Hyun-woo took out his mobile phone.

While doing so, he said.

“Probably what Tae-hyun oppa wants most is for us to frequently use this MP3 phone in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Especially in front of reporters.”

For a moment, Choi Sun-hwa saw the screen of Lee Hyun-woo’s MP3 phone turn colorful.

‘What? That’s different from mine.’

At that moment, thinking she might feel left out, Kim Ah-young quickly explained.

“That one costs over ten million won, so oppa plans to sell it like a luxury item to selected people. Since Hyun-woo gave him the idea, I think he gave it as a special gift.”

Suddenly, Choi Sun-hwa’s desire for that MP3 phone grew.

‘A luxury MP3 phone? Then I deserve to have one too, don’t I?’

She planned to visit Kim Tae-hyun after returning and ask for it.

To make sure he sells her that luxury MP3 phone.
