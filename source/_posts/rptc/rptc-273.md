Usangwon went to see Lee Hyun-woo immediately.

He summarized and delivered the conversation he had with the CTOs.

"Various ideas and concerns are coming up, and they are mostly accurate."

"Yes, especially, Director Jang Yoo-chul is very worried that China will not properly protect copyrights."

"That's understandable. It's something no one can guarantee. We might suffer losses several times greater than in our country. However, we must look at the direction carefully. If we don't venture into China fearing what we might lose, we won't gain anything either."

"Yes, it seems the directors also agree with this. We can't just give up on a population of 1.3 billion..."

"Exactly. Not all of the 1.3 billion will use computers, but even if we capture just 10% of that, it surpasses the internet population of many countries. Honestly, if we're talking in the millions, we can achieve something tremendous. That's big data."

"Ah, yes..."

Lee Hyun-woo had been emphasizing big data for quite some time.

It was already being applied in 【Jungle】.

Using big data obtained from portal sites, they were applying it to shopping.

Although it was just the beginning, the increase in sales was significant.

"I hadn't thought that far ahead."

Usangwon realized once again that Lee Hyun-woo's thinking range was different from his own.

At the same time, he thought of the PDA operating system.

"Come to think of it, Linos seems to be a similar approach."

"Linos? Ah, you mean the operating system?"

"Yes, that's right."

Linos was an operating system created by a university student in Helsinki, Finland.

Unlike Windows, it was an 'open source' that could be used for free, and thus, many participants were still involved in its improvement.

Lee Hyun-woo didn't know much about it, but he had read related information from his past life.

- 90% of cloud computing, 85% of smartphones, 65% of embedded devices, and 99% of the supercomputer market run on Linos.

Even in this life, it was already being utilized.

The PDA operating system developed by Usangwon was based on Linos.

That's why Usangwon mentioned Linos now.

"Linos is completely different from the secret development projects of a single company like Windows, isn't it? Maybe this is what you're referring to as big data, CEO."

"It might be somewhat similar. In my own terms, the big data I've talked about so far is passive, while the open source Linos might be considered active big data."

Here, passive and active referred to the level of collective intelligence involvement.

Search terms on a portal site are input by users without much thought, which is then collected and analyzed by the operator to produce results.

However, the open-source of Linos is something everyone comes together to actively create in a better direction, so it could be defined as active big data.

"Yes, the way you put it, it makes more sense."

Unlike when he first came in, Usangwon's expression and voice were now filled with excitement.

Seeing that, Lee Hyun-woo tilted his head.

‘He looks like he had an epiphany?’

In fact, Usangwon's mind was constantly struck by lightning through his conversation with Lee Hyun-woo.

Naturally, he started discussing this with the three directors he met in the evening.

* * *

"Are you saying you want to create a new programming language?"

"Why all of a sudden..."

"Would you have the time?"

"Of course, I'll be a bit busier. But I'm not doing this alone."

Perhaps that's why Usangwon's expression was very relaxed.

Seeing that, Oh Min-woo also realized that the programming language Usangwon mentioned was closely related to the Linos he mentioned earlier.

"I think I roughly understand."

"Me too."

Following Oh Min-woo, it seemed Lee Jung-woo also caught on.

Only Jang Yoo-chul, who hadn't grasped it yet, tilted his head.

"Huh?"

He also realized it last and asked,

"Are you saying you want to develop it together through online collaboration?"

"Exactly. By doing so, not just me, but countless developers can come together to create it. Just like Linos."

"Why did you suddenly think of this?"

"It's simple. The current development tools are mainly led by 【Macro Soft】. Since the CEO recently suggested surpassing them through an email, we should also think of surpassing them in all areas. Programming languages are fundamental, after all."

At those words, the three of them nodded in agreement as if on cue.

In fact, holding the programming language and development tools in their hands would have a tremendous impact on developers worldwide.

It would be like giving another option to developers who had been creating various software with 【Macro Soft】 as the standard.

"Furthermore, with the open programming language, we can create various things. This might be a long-term project, or even a never-ending project... But with the language and software created by me, us, and developers worldwide, we can try the smartphone operating system that the CEO always talks about."

"I think a server operating system would be good as well."

"And supercomputers."

"If all that is possible, we could even do embedded devices, right?"

Indeed, developers think differently from Lee Hyun-woo.

When given something, they achieve concrete dreams like this.

However, when they gather, the conversation always ends up in a childish direction.

And it always started with Oh Min-woo,

"But in the end, this project seems to be beneficial only to Jung-woo."

"Only me? Why?"

"Because it's open development, your girlfriend can also join and contribute. Then love will blossom during the open development."

"Oh? That's true. Wow, Casanova, you're lucky."

"Hey, you guys! She's not my girlfriend. Just a friend, a friend."

"Sure, sure. But that friend is a girl. So a friend who's a girl means girlfriend."

"Min-woo is truly a master of language. I'm really looking forward to your contribution in Usangwon hyung's project of developing a programming language."

"Ah, seriously... I can't sit here!"

In fact, Lee Jung-woo got up and went outside due to the attacks from Oh Min-woo and Jang Yoo-chul.

The two continued to tease him as he walked away.

"Talking about girlfriends makes him want to go meet her."

"Of course. He must see her every day."

Bang! Lee Jung-woo, seemingly excited, closed the door, and the two laughed.

Then they said,

"But I'm jealous..."

"Right. Spring is coming soon. It makes me feel lonely."

Spring is originally the season when a woman's heart flutters.

For some reason, they felt a void in their hearts.

"Should we accept the matchmaking offer from the Gangnam matchmaker?"

"I don't like that. I'd rather try again with Mari."

Oh Min-woo rejected the artificial meeting format and thought of Kim Mari from the company's training center.

He had tried several times, but she politely declined his date invitations.

That made him like her even more.

It meant she didn't care about Oh Min-woo's background.

Recently, the media introduced him as the core of 【Jungle】 and one of "Lee Hyun-woo's men," attracting the attention of many women.

He received numerous emails, messages, and proposals through blogs and 'Make Friends', but Oh Min-woo didn't want to give up on Kim Mari, who kept refusing.

"Speaking of which, I should go to the company for some training today."

You never know.

Maybe today she'll accept his date proposal...

* * *

Meanwhile, although Lee Jung-woo came out grumbling at his friends, he had an appointment with Yoo Hoseon.

Actually, they met every day these days.

Sometimes Lee Jung-woo made the appointment, and sometimes Yoo Hoseon requested to meet.

The reason they met every day was simple.

"We talk well. But this isn't a romantic issue."

They mainly talked about development.

Recently, it was mostly about the game Lee Jung-woo was interested in.

But after Oh Min-woo and Jang Yoo-chul mentioned the word girlfriend today, he felt strangely uneasy.

This feeling intensified when he met Yoo Hoseon shortly after.

"Oppa, I thought about it yesterday. There's a way to apply the AI the CEO mentioned to the game of Go. We can release it in Korea, China, and Japan. The sample size will increase exponentially, and a vast amount of data will be accumulated."

Yesterday's topic was whether AI could beat a Go professional.

This was something Lee Hyun-woo had already conceived and proposed to Lee Jung-woo, with plans to integrate it someday.

Yoo Hoseon, who showed interest as soon as she heard it, unknowingly mentioned the concept of big data.

She thought about it like a homework assignment and asked Lee Jung-woo as if seeking approval.

"..."

When Lee Jung-woo didn't respond, she asked,

"Is it not good?"

"No, it... it's good!"

Suddenly, Lee Jung-woo started stuttering.

‘Why does she look so pretty today?’

He realized the reason a bit later.

‘She put on makeup! Why?’

The reason wasn't hard to guess.

He remembered saying in passing, "You'd look really pretty with makeup."

‘So, does Hoseon also like me?’

Lee Jung-woo's heart pounded.

* * *

That day, as soon as Lee Jung-woo got home, he sought advice from Lee Hyun-woo.

"It seems like the sister-in-law strategy is working."

"What?"

"I mean, I kept denying it, but I keep thinking about Hoseon."

"That's great. Hahaha."

Lee Hyun-woo laughed heartily, imagining Lee Jung-woo finally breaking free from his workaholism.

"So, what about that girl? How do you think she feels about you?"

"It's hard to be 100% sure, but maybe?"

"Wow, that's really good news."

"I didn't expect it to turn out like this... But I think getting to know each other slowly isn't a bad idea."

"Yeah, from now on, don't just focus on work; make time for love too. Honestly, it was frustrating to see you stuck in that apartment, just making games."

Lee Jung-woo chuckled. He always knew why his brother cared about his love life.

Work-life balance.

He sometimes found it fascinating.

Wouldn't a manager welcome a workaholic employee?

"Oh, speaking of games, the development of 'Space War' is nearing completion."

"What, really? So soon?"

He thought it would take at least two years.

But it seemed that wasn't the case.

"I think referring to what you mentioned early on sped up the development. I think it might be completed around the time we venture into China."

Lee Hyun-woo's eyes sparkled.

'Space War' could be seen as the previous life's 'Space Craft.'

'Another world-changing item is being developed by my brother's hands.'
