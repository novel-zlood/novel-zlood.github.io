Meanwhile, Jang Kang-hyun was busy explaining something to Lee Jung-woo.

"Personally, I thought just having a Go board and stones made the game look too ordinary."

"Then what do you think would be better?"

"I was thinking, how about letting the players choose characters for the match?"

"That's a great idea!"

Lee Hyun-woo's eyes widened.

It seemed this wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thought.

It was clear that during the past week, since joining the company, this person had been adapting and finding their role.

'I'm glad I approached him earlier.'

After the meeting ended, Lee Jung-woo, who had asked for help, listened to Jang Kang-hyun's prepared answer and asked again with a bright face.

"Then, could you help us implement it from now on?"

"Of course. The company hired me to design, so I should definitely create it. However, I can't promise when it will be completed..."

"Time isn't important. Just let me know when it's done. Ah, I'll bring the team members who are working on the game with me later."

"Yes... I'll also encourage the team leaders to prioritize creating Go characters."

It felt more like coercion than encouragement.

Lee Jung-woo kept this thought to himself, stood up, and bowed.

"Then, I look forward to working with you."

"I'll do my best."

With that, Lee Jung-woo left the room.

Suddenly, Jang Kang-hyun thought.

'The company atmosphere isn't bad.'

He wasn't a fool.

He just didn't want to fit into the organization.

Some said he wasn't suited for corporate life.

He accepted that.

That's why he had considered working alone.

He was mentally and physically exhausted from various workplace experiences.

For this reason, he had intended to quit his job after 【Shinhan Construction】.

No one told him to leave, but the overall atmosphere suggested that they would be happy if he resigned, so he was the first to leave.

Then he met a junior designer, Lee Wan.

Lee Wan was currently working hard on designing Korean-style fashion for 【GAPE Korea】.

Despite being busy, he came to him with the following suggestion.

- Hyung, it seems like the company called 【Jungle】 and its CEO respect personal freedom a lot.

- Really?

- Yeah, they don't judge people based on prejudices or biases. I guarantee it.

- Hmm...

- Just give it a try and go for an interview. It's really tough to find a job these days, hyung. And from my experience working alone, it's not easy. In a company, you just have to be mindful of your boss and colleagues, but when you're on your own, you have to be mindful of clients and customers. If you're confident you can handle that, then go independent.

His last words hit home.

Objectively evaluating himself, he wasn't someone who could be very warm to others.

And from his social experience, he knew that when running a business alone, clients and customers judge more than just skills.

That is, how friendly the person is, whether they follow orders, how well they meet design, quantity, and time requirements.

When he asked himself if he was confident in that, the answer was to attend an interview at 【Jungle】.

Fortunately, during the interview, CEO Lee Hyun-woo only asked a few questions.

Could he do web design, game design, and product design for mobile phones or MP3 players?

Jang Kang-hyun answered briefly, "Yes, I can," and said he would immediately create the desired product design.

Then Lee Hyun-woo asked another question.

If Go were played online, what else would be needed besides the board and black and white stones?

Jang Kang-hyun requested paper and quickly drew a design.

It was a design that turned the hand into a character shape, created in a very short time.

Seeing the joy in Lee Hyun-woo's eyes at that moment, he sensed he would be accepted.

Indeed, he was accepted, and later became a team leader.

'This is the best first impression I've had of a job so far.'

* * *

For Lee Hyun-woo, company dinners were a rare occasion.

That evening, at Woo Sang-won's request, they entered a nearby barbecue restaurant, where everyone was already waiting.

The first person to bow was Shin Dong-woon.

"CEO, you came?"

"Oh my, you came?"

Hwang Do-hoon, who wasn't as formal but got up quickly, was just as fast as Shin Dong-woon.

Lee Hyun-woo quickly spoke.

"Our company doesn't place much importance on formalities, so please feel comfortable around me."

"Yes, CEO."

"Hahaha..."

Following Shin Dong-woon, Hwang Do-hoon laughed awkwardly and looked around.

Indeed, everyone was treating Lee Hyun-woo comfortably.

"CEO, please sit here."

"No, no. Next to me!"

"I have something to discuss today."

"Guys, enough. Today, I want to clink glasses with the new team leaders."

Lee Hyun-woo sat across from Hwang Do-hoon with a deliberately casual tone.

Then he asked,

"By the way, where is Team Leader Jang Kang-hyun?"

"He said he's not good with alcohol."

"Ah, then he shouldn't come to these dinners. No, we should have alcohol-free dinners for such people in the future."

"That's a good idea."

"I agree."

"I disagree."

"Then those who disagree can have drinking parties with their own teams."

Listening to the conversation, Hwang Do-hoon realized once again.

'You really don't have to attend these dinners out of obligation here.'

At the same time, he thought he should quietly observe the atmosphere today.

If he acted like an old-school boss as he did in his previous company, he might stand out awkwardly.

'From now on, I should focus on one-on-one interactions to make allies.'

No matter how free this company seemed, factions were inevitable.

At 【Daehan Communications】, he had built the largest faction in the company, but later lost authority when his subordinates sided with others and left the company due to face.

He vowed not to let that happen again.

But then.

"I strangely like people who silently do their work like Team Leader Jang Kang-hyun."

He was surprised to hear Lee Hyun-woo say this.

'What, can he read my thoughts?'

In fact, in his past life, Lee Hyun-woo had only done his own work.

He wasn't as socially awkward as Jang Kang-hyun, but recalling his past life where he silently did his work, he unconsciously said it.

At that moment.

"Oh? I also like Team Leader Jang Kang-hyun."

Are siblings alike?

Lee Jung-woo immediately responded to Lee Hyun-woo's words.

Of course, he meant it in a different way.

"I talked to him earlier, you know? He pointed out the lacking parts right away. So I have high expectations. I think the 'Jungle Go Game' we're going to release this time will be quite decent."

Then, curious, Oh Min-woo chimed in.

"Wasn't the Go game something we started lightly?"

"It started that way. We worked on it whenever we got tired of making other games, and now it's almost complete. Oh, this was the CEO's idea."

"As expected of our CEO. In that sense, can I suggest an idea too?"

"What is it?"

"Since the Go game isn't targeting the younger generation, how about coming up with a new game for a younger audience?"

"A new game? Hey, we agreed not to start anything new for a while."

"Oh, right..."

One of the conclusions they reached during a previous meeting.

Even if starting something new was fun, once a new project began, there would be a shortage of personnel and an overload of work, deviating from Lee Hyun-woo's work-life balance philosophy.

That's why they resolved to finish one thing before starting another.

"We've hired some people, so it should be okay, right?"

It was Lee Hyun-woo himself who interjected.

"C-CEO?"

"I don't think we need to hold back new ideas. Anyway, the final decision will be made by Director Woo and me, so feel free to speak up. Got it?"

"In that case... I was thinking of a lighter game like Gomoku to lower the age demographic. Since we've already made Go, I think it would tie in well."

Everyone nodded at Oh Min-woo's suggestion.

His idea sounded reasonable.

Even Lee Jung-woo's eyes sparkled as he said,

"As you said, since we've made Go, we could quickly create Gomoku. Ah, why didn't I think of that?"

"In that sense, one-shot!"

"One-shot!"

"One-shot!"

Watching them down their drinks, Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

At the same time, he spoke, adding another thought.

"Whether it's Go or Gomoku, just playing isn't fun. You need stakes. Don't you think?"

Lee Hyun-woo made a circle with his thumb and index finger.

It symbolized money.

Everyone was startled.

Especially Woo Sang-won, who quickly intervened.

"Uhm... CEO, gambling would be legally problematic."

"I know."

"Then..."

"We'll use fake money. Then there won't be any issues."

"Ah... I see..."

Listening to their conversation, Oh Min-woo chimed in again.

"If it's fake money, we don't have to limit it to Go and Gomoku. Go-stop or poker could work too."

"Hey, hey... Who comes up with so many new ideas all at once?"

"I've always been thinking about it. I mentioned Gomoku because it's similar to Go. With the CEO mentioning fake money, I just added the idea of Go-stop and poker."

"Even so. Do you think I haven't thought of that?"

"Then it's perfect. Try making it slowly. If you're not confident, hand it over to me."

"Forget it."

Watching Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo bicker again, Lee Hyun-woo laughed.

At the same time, he shifted his gaze to Hwang Do-hoon and gave him a task.

"Team Leader Hwang."

"Yes, CEO."

"Even if we use fake money for the games we're discussing, it would probably be done through charging 【Jungle Money】 later."

"Oh? Then, as you mentioned, the government might see it as an issue."

"That's why I'm asking, can you subtly find out if there are any standards for the degree of gambling? For example, if there's a separate standard for fake money charging."

"Well, I don't think there is..."

"Then we'll proceed as planned and have you keep an eye on it to prepare in advance."

"Ah, yes, understood."

Hwang Do-hoon answered.

He was impressed by Lee Hyun-woo's thoroughness.

At the same time,

'Discussing such matters at a company dinner.'

Should he say he was getting to know the company 【Jungle】 better?

In his previous company, eating, drinking, and having fun was all there was.

【Jungle】 was different. The company dinners felt like an extension of meetings.

Of course, Lee Hyun-woo in front of him really disliked that, but ironically, the atmosphere of 【Jungle】's dinners always turned out this way.

Lastly,

"I'm leaving now."

"What, so soon?"

"In our company, it's tradition to leave after handing over the card during dinners."

Lee Hyun-woo excused himself.

This too was an experience Hwang Do-hoon had never had at a company dinner.

Going through the stages of first round, second round, and even to room salons for entertainment...

'The corporate culture of 【Jungle】 is quite refreshing.'
