Because he was very hungry, Lee Hwan accepted Lee Hyun-woo's suggestion.

Of course, he told his father about the new designer when he got home.

“A designer? Are you already talking about making clothes?”

“Of course, you can take your time. First, let's see how well the current clothes sell.”

“Then you're saying we'll look for a designer after confirming that.”

At that moment, Lee Jung-woo, who had been listening next to them, chimed in.

“Hey, Dad. That means hyung is confident.”

“Oh? Are you now 100% trusting what your brother does?”

“I can't help but believe him. We sold 【Aejeong Apparel】 on our online shopping site this time, and it was another big hit.”

“What do you mean by 'big hit'?”

“It means great success, a term hyung sometimes uses.”

Feeling the conversation was veering off track, Lee Hyun-woo brought the topic back.

“Dad, let's organize it this way. The collaboration event between 【CUBE】 and 【Jungle】 starts the day after tomorrow, right? Let's see how much it sells then.”

“What is a collaboration event?”

“It means partnering to sell together. Hahaha.”

Lee Hyun-woo, who came from the future, often used terms from that time, requiring explanations like this.

“Alright, I got it. But I should study computers and the internet too. I have no idea how things work.”

“I'll teach you.”

“You? No, no. You're busy. I'll learn it myself. Honestly, I feel a bit guilty relying on you kids…”

“There's no need to feel guilty. We owe everything to our parents.”

“Still, no parent likes to rely on their children. For now, I have no choice but to depend on the internet as you said, but later, I will make and supply clothes properly from the store.”

“Of course, you should.”

The success of the collaboration event hinged on Kim Na-yoon, and Lee Hyun-woo smiled subtly at the odd structure.

‘Na-yoon, I'm counting on you. Shine as a true influencer with this opportunity.’

* * *

A week later, at the same time.

Seeing his father hesitate to ask something during dinner, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and spoke up.

“The clothes are selling well.”

“Really?”

“Yes, not bad at all.”

“Really? You’re not just saying that to make me feel better?”

“No, it's true. The 【Aejeong Apparel】 products are selling very well along with others. But I'm still waiting because it's not quite up to my standards yet.”

“Waiting for what?”

“There’s a separate advertisement.”

“Really? Where?”

Feeling his father's anxiety, this time his younger brother Lee Jung-woo stepped in to explain.

“Internet ads.”

“Oh… Internet ads?”

“By the way, honey. Didn't our kids say they make money from internet ads?”

“Yes. Initially, they sold products, but now the advertising revenue is enormous, right?”

“So, is the advertising free, Hyun-woo?”

“Yes, Mom.”

Even his mother began to express her curiosity.

To relieve their worries, Lee Hyun-woo answered inwardly.

‘Of course, the model fee will be covered by treating them to a nice meal later.’

The target, of course, was Kim Na-yoon, and as if thinking of her, his phone buzzed with a message.

- Oppa, I posted it.

Lee Hyun-woo quickly went upstairs.

Naturally, Lee Jung-woo followed him.

After turning on the computer and connecting to the internet, they went to Kim Na-yoon's blog.

“Wow, hyung. This isn't bad.”

“You think so too?”

“Of course, my fashion sense is at least better than yours.”

“Setting that aside, how does it look? Will it succeed?”

“Well, the model is great, but the fact that she's a chaebol's youngest daughter will make it spread like wildfire. She even clearly mentioned buying it from 【Jungle Shopping】. The delivery was smooth, and she loved wearing it. Wow… Being a chaebol's daughter, she really knows how to sell. Even if she's lying, she's doing it so well…”

“It’s all what we guided her to do. We bear the guilt.”

It was true.

During their calls, Lee Hyun-woo had subtly requested Kim Na-yoon to include the current content.

And as expected, the effect was tremendous.

Even while talking with his brother, comments started pouring on the blog post.

- Unnie, you look so pretty.

- You bought it from 【Jungle Shopping】?

- That's not a place for expensive products.

- Can a chaebol's daughter buy such cheap products?

ㄴ Even a chaebol's daughter buys affordable, high-quality products that suit her.

Kim Na-yoon even responded directly to the comments.

“Hyung! Kim Na-yoon is really considerate! She even replies to comments.”

“Right. She didn't have to go this far. We're really indebted to her.”

“Now I’m really curious about the sales. I can't stand it.”

Suddenly standing up, Lee Jung-woo.

Seeing him, Lee Hyun-woo tilted his head in confusion.

“What's up? Where are you going?”

“To the office.”

“What?”

“I need to check how many transactions are being processed.”

“Hey, you can check it tomorrow. You're not even going to school anyway.”

It's summer vacation.

So, Lee Jung-woo had more time to focus on game development, but he came home early today for a break.

But now, saying he couldn't stand the curiosity and was leaving again, Lee Hyun-woo tried to stop him.

“No, no. I'll go and report back to you right away about the sales.”

“The ad effect doesn't show immediately. We need to wait a bit to see.”

“True, but... No, I'll check with minimal expectations.”

In the end, Lee Jung-woo, who insisted on going, couldn't be stopped.

And a little later...

(Hyung, significant results are coming in. No, they're happening. The timing is right after Kim Na-yoon posted on her blog.)

“Really?”

(Yes, you thought I was coming with high expectations? I was just curious. Hahaha.)

“Alright, come back now.”

(No, I'll do some work before coming back. I have meaningful results to finish too.)

Can a game be made this quickly?

Lee Hyun-woo wondered internally.

But he couldn't continue the conversation.

He had to inform his parents about the current meaningful results to reassure them.

As expected, they were pleased, but,

“I'm really indebted to our eldest son this time. How should we repay him?”

“I mentioned about the ad before. We should pay with money.”

Seeing his parents refuse to ride for free, Lee Hyun-woo thought once again.

‘I was born to such parents, so I must repay more than I receive.’

That hasn't changed.

He has continued to help Kim Yoon-soo whenever possible, and he tried to give back more to Kim Ah-young through 【Guseong】.

The same goes for Choi Sun-hwa.

After learning she had helped his father last time, he made sure to take care of her significantly during the recent collaboration event.

‘But fundamentally, it's a win-win situation.’

Not only did 【Aejeong Apparel】 hit the jackpot, but 【Jungle】 was also shifting the paradigm with new shopping items.

When Lee Hyun-woo went to work the next day, he could feel the vibrant atmosphere.

* * *

“CEO, we received a call from 【Duksung Woolen】. They asked if we could host an event on our online shopping platform.”

“【GB Fashion】 also inquired.”

As the success of 【Jungle】’s online shopping was becoming apparent, numerous clothing brands, including these two, proposed online consignment sales.

Lee Hyun-woo had no reason to refuse.

“Accept them all.”

“All of them?”

“If we do that… the event's impact will diminish.”

“We can't help it. But the total sales volume will increase significantly, and people will think they can find all brands at 【Jungle】.”

“Ah…”

“That does make sense.”

“Raise the commission instead. Double the sales commission we received from 【Aejeong Apparel】 and 【Two Woo Fashion】.”

“……!”

“……!”

Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho's eyes widened in surprise.

‘The first ones always get the best benefits.’

‘We pioneered this together, so it can't be helped.’

Trying something new always involves risk.

In that sense, the two initial collaborators received special treatment.

For reference, 【Two Woo Fashion】 is the company owned by Lee Hyun-woo's father.

The name ‘Two Woo’ comes from the last syllables of Hyun‘woo’ and Jung‘woo’.

Meaning, it stood for ‘Two Woo’.

This company was actually persuaded by Lee Hyun-woo to join the collaboration event, so it wasn't really a risky attempt.

However, with the final boss, his father's company, stepping in, they couldn't afford to overlook it.

Frankly, if 【Two Woo Fashion】 hadn’t done well, these two would have been more stressed.

Now, it was time to transfer that stress to other companies.

The first step is always hard; once a success story is shown, this side becomes the dominant player.

Naturally, they could now negotiate commissions with confidence.

* * *

Meanwhile, after finally completing the preparation for their online fashion mall launch, 【Aejeong Apparel】 was quite encouraged by their success on 【Jungle】.

Moreover, their preparation was much faster than other clothing companies, so the expectations were high. A few days later, another issue made headlines.

『Netizens flocking to the blogs of chaebol daughters these days』

Among these articles, Kim Na-yoon from 【Guseong】 and Choi Sun-hwa, the second daughter of 【Aejeong Group】, were mentioned.

“Oh? An article about Choi Sun-hwa Chief is out.”

“I knew she would be a hot topic. Netizens have been visiting her blog a lot lately.”

“I even made friends with her.”

“Really? Me too.”

“Isn't she more down-to-earth than you thought? I commented that I work at 【Aejeong Apparel】, and she asked who I was. She said if we meet, I should say I'm her blog friend, and she'd treat me.”

“Someone actually got treated.”

“Really?”

“Yeah, Kim Jung-seon from the PR team boldly mentioned it and got treated to tonkatsu nearby.”

“Wow, she really keeps her word.”

“She has great business skills too. She raised our cosmetics to second place in the industry, and the upcoming fashion mall was also her idea.”

“Really? Is that why she's so active on her blog?”

“Could be…”

“It's a unique marketing method.”

“Now that it’s making headlines, it's huge. It's like free advertising.”

“With this, the succession battle in our group will be interesting.”

“Right. There are even talks within the group that Chief Choi is better than her brother and sister.”

Whenever they gathered, the conversation revolved around Choi Sun-hwa.

And when the online fashion mall of 【Aejeong Apparel】 opened, its daily sales quickly matched those offline.

『Is it trendy for chaebol daughters to advertise for themselves these days?』

Newspaper articles gradually changed in this direction.

And while 【Aejeong Group】 might not mind, 【Guseong Group】 couldn't just stand by and watch.
