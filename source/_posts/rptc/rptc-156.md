It was quite unexpected.

Who would have thought that the eldest daughter of one of the top conglomerates in our country, Guseong, would have such a thoughtful nature?

With an involuntary smile, Lee Jung-woo spoke.

"Actually, there's something my parents want."

"What is it?"

"An older brother's girlfriend."

It seemed a bit much to call her a daughter-in-law, so he softened the statement slightly.

Then she reacted without hesitation.

"Me?"

It was a clear acknowledgment that she was indeed Lee Hyun-woo's girlfriend.

"Still, the director... Ah-young, what should I call you?"

"Call me whatever you feel comfortable with."

"If I call you comfortably, would it be sister-in-law?"

Unlike Lee Hyun-woo, he was a bit shameless.

Even so, Kim Ah-young didn't mind and responded with a smile.

"Anyways, our parents don't know yet that you're my brother's girlfriend."

"Well, neither do mine."

"Oh, really?"

"Yes, they might have a slight inkling, but we haven't explicitly said that we are dating."

Could their father really not have noticed?

The photos taken when they returned from the U.S. were quite something.

Although their youngest uncle, Jang Jae-won, had well covered it up, there was no way their father hadn't heard about it.

Seeing as he hadn't said anything, it seemed like he was choosing to tacitly approve.

When he thought this far, Lee Jung-woo spoke with a slightly emotional voice.

"I understand. Compared to your family, ours isn't much."

"What? Don't misunderstand. I didn't inform them because Hyun-woo didn't want me to."

"Really?"

"Yes, of course, Hyun-woo never said it directly, but you can tell indirectly. He didn't want either family to know we were dating yet."

"Oh, my brother is like that. He's inflexible, old-fashioned, and worries ahead of time about things that haven't even happened yet. What I mentioned earlier must have been on his mind too. The fact that our family isn't as well off."

There were some parts he didn't want to agree with, but he understood the last part.

'Yeah, that must be it.'

Maybe that's why he hadn't asked her to date him upfront.

Even without saying it, they were already lovers.

"Alright, I understand. Then..."

"……."

"Can I ask you one favor?"

"What..."

"I want to treat my parents to a meal on Parents' Day. Could you bring them to Seorabeol Hotel?"

Lee Jung-woo's eyes widened.

He hadn't expected her to actually fulfill his parents' wish.

But.

"Actually, I can't do something that Hyun-woo dislikes openly. But I have an idea..."

Listening to what she said next, Lee Jung-woo laughed.

It was an idea that met everyone's expectations to a certain extent.

'Yeah, this will work. Our parents will later realize their wish has been fulfilled, and our brother won't dislike it.'

Nodding, he looked at Kim Ah-young slowly again.

With her beauty and wisdom, she seemed like a perfect match for his brother.

Suddenly, he felt envious.

'Ah, I need to find a girlfriend as pretty and smart as sister-in-law someday.'

As the heat approached, he felt a sudden loneliness.

* * *

On the evening of May 7th,

While dining together after a long time, Lee Jung-woo casually mentioned the next day's plan.

"I'll treat you all to a big dinner tomorrow night."

"Treat?"

"What?"

"Of course, the most expensive and delicious meal in the world, with the best service."

His parents exchanged glances, and Lee Hyun-woo looked at his brother with a perplexed expression.

Then he thought,

'Come to think of it, this guy probably wants to show some filial piety to our parents too.'

From his brother's perspective,

Lee Jung-woo had always been compared to his older brother.

Even when giving gifts or treating their parents, it was the same.

In his previous and current lives, Lee Hyun-woo had more, so he had fewer opportunities to show filial piety.

This time, he decided to yield to his brother.

Moreover, he hadn't prepared the gift their parents wanted.

'Marriage and a daughter-in-law are impossible right now.'

With the intention of doing it later, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and said,

"I'm looking forward to it. Where is this place with the best service? What kind of restaurant is it?"

"If I tell you in advance, it will spoil the fun. I'll pick you up by car tomorrow, so you wait at home with our parents."

"Alright, got it."

"Parents, you can look forward to it."

"Don't spend too much money."

"Yes, don't spend too much just because you earn a lot. Save the money for your marriage later."

"Oh dear, you're starting to nag again. Don't worry. I earn a lot, thanks to my brother."

"Alright, alright."

"Who did this guy take after to be so boastful and smooth?"

Their parents felt the same way as Lee Hyun-woo.

Whether intentional or not, Lee Jung-woo had always been compared to his older brother.

Although there were no fingers that didn't hurt, there was a sense of guilt towards the seemingly shorter finger.

So, when their second son said he would treat them to a big meal, even if it was boastful, they could only accept it with a smile.

* * *

The next day,

Lee Hyun-woo waited at home with his parents, and at the promised time, Lee Jung-woo arrived to pick them up.

Looking at the route, he had a vague feeling.

'Is it near the school?'

It seemed like they were heading in the direction of Wangsimni.

But it wasn't.

They took a different route midway and entered the Chungmuro area.

Then they stopped at a familiar place.

"What?"

Lee Hyun-woo's eyes widened.

They arrived at Seorabeol Hotel.

Slightly taken aback, he composed himself, and Lee Jung-woo told them to get off.

"They'll valet park for us."

"Hey? Isn't this too expensive?"

"Yes, it's Seorabeol Hotel. It must be really expensive here."

"Oh, Mom! Dad! I told you I would treat you big. Just leave everything to me today and don't say anything."

Lee Jung-woo's commanding tone left his parents speechless.

However, Lee Hyun-woo quickly approached Lee Jung-woo and whispered.

"You... don't tell me..."

"Hyung, trust me. Don't worry about anything, just trust me. Okay?"

"……."

Lee Hyun-woo wondered if his brother was trying to introduce Kim Ah-young to their parents.

But since he was saying it wasn't, he had no choice but to trust him and take the elevator up.

They went up for quite a while.

No matter how he thought about it, he didn't remember the Seorabeol Hotel restaurant being this high up.

But it seemed there was one.

After a while, the elevator doors opened, and they were guided to a room with a clear view outside. As soon as they sat down, another female employee entered.

No, he thought she was another female employee.

"……!"

It was Kim Ah-young.

Lee Hyun-woo was surprised, but as he watched Lee Jung-woo ordering from her, he had to sort out the situation in his head.

But.

"I made a reservation order, right?"

"Yes, everything is ready and coming up now."

They must have planned this together.

But the atmosphere was indescribably strange.

At least it didn't seem like they were setting up to introduce Kim Ah-young.

Even so, he wanted to give his brother a flick on the forehead for looking so amused.

'What on earth is he thinking?'

While he was wondering this, he heard his parents' voices.

"Is this really okay? It feels like we're sitting in a place where the president might come, and it makes me nervous."

"Yeah, is this within your salary range?"

His parents clearly sensed it too.

This level of service was not something just anyone could receive.

After all, who could receive food served directly by the eldest daughter of Guseong Group?

When he thought this far, Lee Hyun-woo's mind drew a scenario involving his brother and Kim Ah-young.

'They must have met beforehand.'

And Kim Ah-young must have asked.

What kind of gift would please the parents?

His brother would have said.

A daughter-in-law, or Lee Hyun-woo's marriage.

Of course, that couldn't be fulfilled immediately.

But he remembered a conversation with his parents not long ago.

- Show us her face later. We're really curious.

- Yes, I'll try my best.

- If possible, on Parents' Day.

- Yes, I'll try my best for that too.

He had said he would try but hadn't made any effort or fulfilled it.

Instead, his brother and Kim Ah-young had made an effort to show his girlfriend's face, fulfilling their parents' wish.

When he looked back at his brother, he saw him mouthing the words.

'Thankful, right?'

Well, he couldn't say it wasn't.

But more than his brother, he was grateful to Kim Ah-young for stepping up to serve his parents like this.

She was even serving the food herself.

Even when the table was fully set...

"Let me serve that for you."

She was personally serving the dishes.

His parents, not used to such hospitality, spoke to her.

"Oh dear... I can do it myself..."

"Yes, miss, we can do it."

"But we feel like we've seen you somewhere before."

"Right? She looks familiar. Where could it be?"

Kim Ah-young might not have been unfamiliar to them.

They had faced each other when moving buildings last year.

The difference in attire might have made it hard for them to recall.

'Come to think of it, she's dressed simply today.'

Was it the staff concept? Or maybe she avoided flashy attire to greet her boyfriend's parents?

He didn't know, but after distributing all the food to the plates, Kim Ah-young headed to the door and bowed 90 degrees.

"Enjoy your meal, and if you need anything, please call me."

"Oh, there's no need to call. It's fine, just go about your work."

"Yes, we can eat on our own, so go and rest."

Bowing slightly with a warm smile, Kim Ah-young left.

And then.

"I need to use the restroom."

Lee Hyun-woo stood up and followed her.

After confirming he was far from the room, he spoke softly.

"Ah-young..."

"Oh, Hyun-woo."

"How did this happen...?"

"It was too sudden, right? Sorry for not discussing it..."

"No, why apologize? I'm grateful."

"Oh, really? I'm glad."

Seeing her smile brightly, how could his heart not be moved?

Unconsciously, he held her hand tightly and said.

"Thank you so much. I'll repay you somehow, okay?"

"It's okay, it's not a transaction or anything. Are you uncomfortable?"

"No, it's not that. I'm just really grateful."

"Then it's fine. Now, go back and eat. You can't be absent from that spot, not on Parents' Day."

She was the one here on Parents' Day.

He wanted to ask, but it seemed like the conversation would get long, so Lee Hyun-woo nodded.

"Alright, we'll talk later."

"Okay, go in."

As he walked back to the room, he turned to look at her several times.

Her back looked so beautiful.

He wasn't the only one who felt this way.

As soon as he stepped into the room, he heard his parents' voices.

"Dear, doesn't that girl look like an actress?"

"I don't know. But she's really pretty and demure."

"Right. And she seems so reserved... I want to make her our daughter-in-law."

"Exactly."

Suddenly, Lee Hyun-woo looked at his brother again.

His brother was mouthing something again.

'I also want her as my sister-in-law.'

Filled with indescribable joy, Lee Hyun-woo smiled broadly and said to himself.

Yes, me too. I want her as my wife.
