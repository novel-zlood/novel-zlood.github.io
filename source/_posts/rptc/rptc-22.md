Lee Hyun-woo had a unique experience.

This was also the first step in shifting the focus of his life slightly toward work-life balance.

'I should enjoy this more often.'

Meanwhile, the second day of Shin Sung-hoon's concert also concluded successfully.

It was a given since the top singer of this era was unlikely to fail, but the fact that tickets were being sold online for the first time started making headlines.

『【Nine Sound】's New Initiative, Buying Tickets on 【Jungle】.』

This meant that the website 【Jungle】 was being promoted through newspaper articles.

In this era, the concentration of information was no joke.

Looking back later, people would call the current media landscape a monopoly.

It meant that the places where the public accessed and distributed information were limited.

As a result, the newspaper article led to a surge in users of 【Jungle】.

Lee Jung-woo and Jang Yoo-chul were having a ping-pong conversation as if they were broadcasting this.

"Is this why people advertise in newspapers?"

"I guess so. I've been checking the number of visitors since earlier."

"Same here. Ah, damn! I can't focus on work because of these numbers."

"But we still have to do it. Let's control ourselves."

At that moment, Lee Hyun-woo stepped in and continued speaking in a relaxed voice.

"There's no need for that."

"Sorry?"

"You're saying we don't need to control ourselves?"

"Everything serves as motivation. Do you think working all day increases efficiency?"

"No, it doesn't."

"Right, exactly."

"In fact, we do a lot of other things, don't we?"

"Well..."

"......"

"So if you're going to do something else, engaging in such healthy conversations is always welcome. Otherwise, office life gets too dreary."

"Haha... I think we've met a really good CEO."

"I'm really grateful to Lee Jung-woo for introducing me. I'll consider you both benefactors of my life."

Hearing Jang Yoo-chul's words, Lee Hyun-woo chuckled.

But what Lee Hyun-woo said was true.

In his previous life, even until he died, South Korea proudly held the second-longest working hours among OECD countries.

The more absurd record was the actual working time compared to working hours.

Only 2 hours and 17 minutes.

The rest of the time was spent either loafing around while keeping an eye on the boss, playing, or secretly surfing the net—this was the life of office workers.

Perhaps this habit developed from being forced to sit in school since high school.

Therefore, Lee Hyun-woo believed that such motivational checks were the driving force for work efficiency.

But that didn’t mean he didn’t assign work.

Shortly after, he gave an order to his younger brother and Jang Yoo-chul.

"Start taking pre-orders for the live album."

"Already take orders?"

"Yes, that's why it's a pre-order of 10,000 copies. If you order now, you can get it for 8,000 won. Make sure to display this prominently as a large event."

"In other words, though the regular price is 10,000 won, this is an opportunity to get a 2,000 won discount."

"Good, good."

Originally, the strategy was to sell it for 8,000 won, but following Lee Hyun-woo's direction to add a bit of flair, the two quickly got to work.

As time went by, their coordination improved, and their proficiency increased.

Perhaps because of this, it didn’t take long for them to display a new window on 【Jungle】's main screen.

"CEO, it's done."

"Take a look."

Lee Hyun-woo smiled contentedly as he looked at the large event window that popped up next to the 'Solids' concert, which Han Se-jin had recently secured.

‘I hope the 10,000 pre-orders get filled quickly.’

Based on the results, he planned to order an additional 10,000 copies from Nine Sound.

On the other hand, noticing Lee Hyun-woo's expression, the two people next to him subtly began to express doubts under the guise of conversation.

"Will it be effective to display an event window for a product that's not released yet?"

"I don't know. It feels like people wouldn't spend money on something that doesn't exist."

"Why spend money?"

"Sorry?"

"Then what?"

"Pre-orders are just pre-orders. No money is involved right now."

As he answered, it was clear that users would think the same way as the two of them.

"You haven't activated the payment window yet, right?"

"Yes, today is just about announcing it."

"Then let's tweak the event window a bit more."

"How?"

"Emphasize that it's a free pre-order. Highlight the word 'free'."

In a way, it was like baiting the consumers.

Up until now, about 90% of 【Jungle】's customers used bank transfers, and 10% used credit cards.

When ordering a product, payment had to be made first, either through bank transfer or credit card, before shipping would start.

But this time, orders could be placed without that process.

Calling it 'free' might encourage more users to utilize the pre-order method.

‘Trial and error are inevitable.’

Modification notices had often been made.

So when the revised notice, highlighting 'free,' was displayed again, he smiled with satisfaction.

The issue was that as 【Jungle】 grew in scale, their PG (Payment Gateway) company contacted them.

Most calls were received by Yoo Jin-young, but since she wasn't familiar with this, Lee Hyun-woo had to take over.

"Hello, this is Lee Hyun-woo."

(I checked the website? It says pre-orders are free, but then it says 8,000 won later...)

"Ah, there's no need for you to worry about that. Simply put, we’re only taking orders now, and payments can be made later."

The PG (Payment Gateway) company helps businesses with bank transfers and credit card transactions for a fee.

Even such a company inquired, showing how unfamiliar pre-order methods were in this era.

'In the future, every idea borrowed from the future will be seen as new and fresh.'

A wry smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo's face.

* * *

But that day, another call that came in surprised the entire company.

"CEO, I think you should take this call too."

What could it be this time?

With curiosity evident on his face, Lee Hyun-woo picked up the receiver.

"Hello, this is Lee Hyun-woo, CEO of 【Jungle】."

Immediately, the other side introduced themselves.

(Hello, CEO.)

"Yes, hello."

(I’m Heo Sol, a reporter from KBC News Culture and Entertainment Department.)

"Oh, yes..."

A reporter? From a broadcasting company?

He was slightly bewildered inside, but then he heard an even more surprising question.

(Actually, I’d like to request an interview. Are you available?)

"An interview? With me?"

(Yes, CEO.)

"Didn't you say you were from the Entertainment Department?"

(Yes, specifically from the Culture and Entertainment Department. It seems the public has become curious about Shin Sung-hoon's concert recently. Some tickets were sold on your 【Jungle】 site, right?)

"Yes, that's correct."

(We’d like to briefly introduce this on the news, and it won’t take much time.)

Was there any reason to refuse?

No, he welcomed it with open arms.

"Yes, that's fine. When shall we do it?"

(The sooner, the better for us. Tomorrow, if possible.)

"Oh, then come tomorrow."

(You’re very decisive. We’ll visit you first thing tomorrow morning.)

"Alright, see you tomorrow."

Ending the call with a gentle smile on his lips, Lee Hyun-woo thought,

'For the first time in both my previous and current life, I might be on TV.'

Would it be good for his face to be on TV?

Definitely not.

Even though he had listed things he hadn't done in his past life, he had no intention of entering the entertainment industry whatsoever.

However, media exposure related to business was always welcome.

Especially if this interview could make 【Jungle】 more widely known.

'In 1996, there were only three major broadcasting companies, and dramas would get ratings from 30% to 50% if they gained momentum.'

It was an era of monopoly in media.

One mention in the newspaper led to an explosive increase in visitors to 【Jungle】.

'Then, wouldn't it be the same for the news?'

KBC News had the highest viewership ratings, and the thought of reaching countless people made Lee Hyun-woo's heart race.

While maintaining his goal of enjoying life, he also wanted to achieve rapid business success, so his excitement was natural.

Apparently, it wasn't just Lee Hyun-woo feeling this way.

As soon as the clock struck 4:45 PM and the workday ended, Yoo Jin-young stood up and muttered to herself,

"I need to go buy some clothes."

Although the interview was with Lee Hyun-woo, who knows what she was thinking.

The next day, Yoo Jin-young greeted him with heavy makeup that seemed out of place.

"Good morning, CEO."

She seemed to have put on makeup, expecting to be caught on camera.

Lee Hyun-woo chuckled and took his seat, and soon after, the other three also showed up dressed neatly.

'No wonder Lee Jung-woo didn't come to work with me.'

Seeing their reactions made him realize the power of television once again.

At the same time, he became calm.

He contemplated how to promote 【Jungle】 with each and every word of the upcoming interview.

Eventually, with the reporter and crew in front of him, he received basic questions.

It seemed like they were coordinating the questions and answers before the actual interview.

"As I looked through the website, it reminded me of 【eBay】 and 【Amazoness】 in the U.S."

"Yes, that's correct. 【Amazoness】 started two years ago, and 【eBay】 started a year ago. Our website combines the strengths of both."

"Oh, I see."

The reporter was indeed well-informed.

Seeing that he had studied the two sites, it was clear that he was different from the future journalists who would be called 'giraegi' (a derogatory term for journalists).

His questions were also very professional.

"This is what you call a blue ocean strategy, right? Discovering a new sea first to catch fresh fish. In Korea, it would be labeled as 'the first of its kind.'"

"Actually, we're looking even further ahead."

"Further ahead?"

"Not just within Korea, but the world. Eventually, we want to compete with and surpass 【Amazoness】 and 【eBay】."

"Wow, I want to support that."

Unintentionally, Lee Hyun-woo revealed his dream.

But this wasn't the actual interview.

In fact, it didn't even fit the context of this interview.

The Culture and Entertainment Department wouldn't dig deep into economics or IT.

The actual questions focused on Shin Sung-hoon's concert.

Fortunately, he managed to slip in a mention of the CD pre-order.

"I'll make sure to include that part."

The reporter's promise to edit it well made him hopeful.

However, after the interview, the others didn't look pleased.

"Why the long faces?"

"They didn't pay attention to us at all."

"Ugh, I bought these clothes for nothing."

Lee Hyun-woo chuckled at their complaints.

But this laughter turned into cheers a few days later when the news aired.

That day, the 10,000 pre-orders sold out completely.
