The name of Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young's son is Lee Young-jae, and his name was given by his grandfather, Lee Jung-ryong.

Although Lee Young-jae was just born, he received a lot of attention and interest from many people.

It was no wonder since his mother's family was the top conglomerate in South Korea, and his father was a world-renowned self-made CEO.

Due to this, there was a lot of attention, and Lee Hyun-woo finally understood why the people of the 【Guseong Group】 had been avoiding the media.

‘If things go wrong, the child will have no privacy.’

How could he grow up normally like this?

So, he earnestly asked the journalists to help, but words alone were not enough.

He had no choice but to think of a clever method.

‘I need to make the journalists focus more on me and 【Jungle】.’

Just in time, ideas were pouring out like a waterfall at 【Jungle】.

This was because of the Company in Company and CEO by CEO policies that Lee Hyun-woo had induced, which were bearing fruit.

The first idea product that came out, the power alert device, was a big hit. Along with it, countless idea products that could change everyday life were launched from there.

There was even a saying that the things in front were blocking the things behind.

However, just changing everyday life wasn't enough to capture the journalists' full attention, so Lee Hyun-woo had to throw a bigger bait.

"We will implement 24-hour delivery in the near future."

"24-hour delivery?"

"What could that be? Is it related to moving?"

"No, it has to do with 24 hours."

"Oh..."

Nodding.

It seemed that the two secretaries finally understood after he explained it to them.

Naturally, questions followed.

"So, you mean that after ordering goods, they will be delivered within 24 hours?"

"Yes, that's exactly it. We will first implement it in Jeju Island."

This was why they built a large logistics center.

Although it would take some time to expand it nationwide, they planned to attract people's attention by first launching it in Jeju Island.

"By the way, the 24-hour delivery will be done by directly hired delivery staff."

The two people were surprised once again at this statement.

Although still young, they had lived with 【Jungle】 for nearly five years.

When a particular policy was implemented, the picture automatically formed in their minds, so they couldn't help but discuss it outside the chairman's office.

"How many people would be needed to deliver to all places in Jeju Island within 24 hours?"

"Well, the population of Jeju Island seems to be soon over 600,000..."

Kang Dong-ho was more knowledgeable about delivery.

In other words, he was the legendary figure who designed the current delivery system by linking 【Jungle Shopping】 with logistics companies in the early stages.

"When I heard from that side, one person can deliver about 200 items a day, right? Recently, the volume of 【Jungle Shopping】 in Jeju Island has increased significantly, and I heard it's over 30,000 items a day."

"Hmm... even with simple calculations, we need to hire 150 delivery staff."

"150 people... then the population of Jeju Island will increase by at least several hundred more."

"No, the chairman emphasized delivering within 24 hours. So, we need people for logistics work as well, and since 150 people can't work seven days a week, we need additional rotation staff. Considering their families, the number would easily increase to a thousand, right?"

"Haha..."

The two people mentioned the population of Jeju Island with a tone of concern, not expectation.

Although it was predicted that the situation in Jeju Island would improve this year, it was something they heard every year.

On the contrary, seeing the explosive growth of places that entered Jeju Island first in the past two years, many companies were announcing plans to relocate or build research and development centers in Jeju Island.

Recently, there were even news about a department store being built, which seemed unlikely.

If things go this way, the population of one million might be within sight, but it was uncertain whether the living infrastructure like housing could match the increasing number of people.

"What good is our worry? We're not the president."

"Even the president can't solve that. No one, not even a god, could have predicted the market would turn out this way."

"It seems like the name of Jeju Island is becoming known as a better place to live. If the 24-hour delivery system planned by the chairman is established, it will become even more convenient to live here."

"Yes, probably."

Eventually, they stopped predicting the future.

As always, there were too many variables in the middle, and predictions tended not to come true.

When supply was short, they lived with the shortage until one day it was filled again, and then demand exploded once more.

Therefore, they felt it was best to leave the solution to politicians.

Thus, 【Jungle】 was dreaming of another delivery revolution.

* * *

The human resources development team played an active role whenever they recruited personnel.

The head of the department, Koo Man-hoi, was already an executive director, but he was famous for not stopping his direct interactions on the field.

This time was no different; following Lee Hyun-woo’s instructions, he personally took the lead in the '24-Man Talent Development Project.'

The total number of recruits for 24-Men, who would be solely responsible for delivery, was 200.

Considering the population increase in Jeju Island in the future, Lee Hyun-woo suggested that this number of personnel was necessary, so they started scouring high schools and universities in the area.

Both places could produce new entrants to society.

"Our 24-Men will wear T-shirts made by 【Jungle Communication】 and move with trucks provided by the company. The average starting salary is 25 million won..."

As expected, when money was mentioned, people's eyes sparkled.

The prospective graduates gathered at the recruitment briefing of 【Seogwipo University】 were no different from what was expected.

With a salary much higher than the average in South Korea for a job in delivery, how could their eyes not turn?

Some communicated in whispers.

"Did he say 25 million? Did I hear it wrong?"

"That's right, 25 million."

"Is there any other job besides delivery? Since it's 【Jungle】, maybe we need to know how to handle programming?"

"Come on, does that make sense? If that were the case, they wouldn't have come to our school. There are so many top schools inland."

"No, Lee Hyun-woo bought our school. Maybe he’s trying to make it into an IT specialized university."

"Are you kidding? That acquisition happened last year, and we entered three years ago. 【Seogwipo University】 is completely different from what it was back then. And if you listen to the explanation, the job is really simple. Receive items from the logistics center and deliver them to the front door. Within 24 hours."

"Exactly. But will they really pay more than the average salary for such a simple job? Maybe the work is extremely tough?"

"Don’t you know Lee Hyun-woo? One of the corporate values of 【Jungle】 is work-life balance. It’s definitely a five-day workweek."

As Koo Man-hoi suggested a standard higher than the average annual salary in 2002, some students found it hard to believe.

But that was just the beginning.

When the recruitment announcement from 【Jungle Communication】 was posted, delivery workers from all over the country flocked like bees.

It was no wonder; with an annual salary of 25 million won plus the provision of the four major insurances and the status of a regular employee, which was hard to find anywhere else, they couldn't help but be attracted.

Thus, the competition for experienced hires exceeded hundreds to one, and by the deadline, it hit a thousand to one.

From the conversations on the interview day, it was clear how groundbreaking it was.

"I really hope I get selected."

"Me too. An annual salary of 25 million?"

"Plus the four major insurances and being a regular employee without the risk of being laid off, how can we not try?"

"Honestly, other companies are too much. Not only do we get about 600 won per delivery item, but we also have to pay for fuel and phone bills out of our earnings."

"Before that, we even have to prepare our own trucks. Maintenance costs are also on us. But 【Jungle】 provides us with trucks."

"More than the money, the amazing thing is limiting the daily delivery volume to 150 items. Sometimes I thought I might die from overwork."

"Right, right. In summer, your body dries up."

"But they say we shouldn't worry about big corporations, though I wonder if they can sustain this kind of operation. Hiring as regular employees means fixed costs, and what do you call it... the employment flexibility that our previous companies always talked about will decrease."

"Hey, as you said, we don't need to worry about big corporations. Do you know how much money Lee Hyun-woo makes in a day?"

"True. I saw an article recently; they said the gap between him and the world’s richest man, Billy Kates, has narrowed significantly."

What they said at the end was true.

Billy Kates' wealth in 2001 was about 40 trillion won in Korean currency.

But Lee Hyun-woo followed closely with nearly 20 trillion won worth of stock valuation.

This was despite the slight IT bubble burst over the past two years.

Or maybe because of it.

At that time, the bubble burst in the US was greater than in Korea, resulting in delays in the entry of companies like 【Macro Soft】 into the Jeju Island R&D center.

"Indeed, we don’t need to worry about big corporations. Instead, I feel more comfortable thinking that they might be trying to make more money through this delivery service."

"Right. We don't need to worry about big corporations. Actually, the companies we worked at didn't even think about our health. If we collapsed and died on the street, they wouldn't blink an eye."

Though it might not go that far, it was true that the environment was poor.

So, these people even prepared to move to Jeju Island to challenge for the delivery jobs at 【Jungle Communication】.

But with a selection rate of one in a thousand, it was like threading a camel through the eye of a needle, so they were very anxious.

A while later, the results came out, and while some rejoiced and others were disappointed, a new hope emerged once 24-hour delivery began in Jeju Island.

『【Jungle Communication】 sparks a new wave with a delivery revolution in Jeju Island!』

Looking at the article, it said that as fast delivery within 24 hours was achieved, the proportion of online shopping by people increased tremendously.

As it seemed impossible for the existing delivery workers to handle this volume, 【Jungle】 was considering additional recruitment.

Naturally, their eyes shone with a mix of hope and expectation.

On the other hand, the large corporations with delivery companies were in a panic.

As 【Jungle】 entered the market like a catfish and stirred things up, they had no choice but to improve the treatment of their delivery workers.

Moreover, with the completion of the 【Give and Take】 headquarters, the entry into the food delivery business in Jeju Island, which had been delayed due to the US IT bubble burst, began, making it inevitable for the value of delivery workers to rise for the time being.
