Kim Tae-hyun, who came outside to the yard, responded to Kim Sung-moo's recommendation by saying he would think about it.

‘Father was thinking similarly to me.’

However, keeping Lee Hyun-woo by his side wasn't an easy task.

Since it was impossible for him to leave Jungle, Guseong had to acquire that company.

In the past, it could have been bet at a reasonable price, but now its value was increasing day by day.

Therefore, it was clear that the second method was being considered.

‘Ah-young’s partner?’

Kim Tae-hyun was well aware that the two had been getting closer recently.

And he thought about having Lee Hyun-woo as his brother-in-law.

‘Not bad.’

Strategic marriages were frequent in chaebol families.

It was clear that one day both Kim Tae-hyun and Kim Ah-young would be tied to other chaebol groups as needed.

Although Lee Hyun-woo wasn't from a chaebol family, he was showing abilities that surpassed that background.

Moreover, it seemed that Kim Ah-young didn't dislike him.

‘Good. I'll help speed up the relationship between the two of you.’

After thinking this far, Kim Tae-hyun picked up the phone and found Lee Hyun-woo's number.

The phone didn't ring for long before he answered.

(Hello?)

“Hey, Hyun-woo. It's me.”

(Oh, hyung.)

“You’re doing well, right?”

(Of course. I miss you.)

This was one of Lee Hyun-woo's great points.

Even when he was just saying it, it somehow made one feel good.

“Nonsense?”

(It’s not nonsense. There are many things I want to ask.)

“Really?”

(Yes, please make some time.)

For some reason, he smelled something fishy this time.

But he couldn't refuse.

Kim Tae-hyun also wanted to meet him.

“Perfect. I wanted to see you too.”

(Really? Because of what….)

“I want to introduce you to someone who would be good for you to know.”

(Can't it be just the two of us?)

“No, what do you want to ask this time?”

(It’s nothing special. I'm just curious if Guseong is really jumping into the acquisition of Geukdong Gas.)

“You are very interested in our family matters. That’s not something I can talk about carelessly. I'll tell you when we get closer.”

(That’s disappointing. It sounds like we aren't that close.)

“Never mind, just concede this time.”

(Haha…)

He laughed awkwardly, indicating he didn't like it.

Indeed, from what he had seen, the guy was a workaholic.

He denies it, but that’s deceiving himself.

“Aren't you tired of always talking about work? It seems like you work day and night anyway. Take this opportunity to enjoy life a bit. Okay?”

(What do you mean I only work? I love having fun.)

“Then you’ll make time, right?”

(Well… yes, I understand. But specifically who are you introducing?)

“Our peers among our relatives. You’ll probably like them when you meet them.”

The advantage of chaebol children was that they were generous to others.

The disadvantage was that they were generous even when it wasn't wanted.

Kim Tae-hyun was no different, and he had a simplistic belief that if he gave, the other person would unconditionally like it.

So, it created uncomfortable situations when rejected,

(Okay. Let me know the time and date.)

Fortunately, Lee Hyun-woo gave an okay sign.

‘Why am I worrying about this guy?’

This wasn’t how it started, but somehow he had lost the initiative.

So, he pulled himself together and said,

“Oh, I’ll call you again later about that. Okay?”

(Yes, hyung.)

After hanging up the phone, Kim Tae-hyun pressed the end button.

Just then, someone’s voice was heard.

“Oppa! What are you doing?”

Turning around, it was Kim Ah-young.

“You scared me. How much did you hear?”

“Hyun-woo, it's me.”

“Oh, you heard everything from the beginning. Why are you eavesdropping on the phone like a cat?”

“Why are you calling the relatives and involving Hyun-woo with them?”

“Why don’t you try fixing your habit of only saying what you want to say?”

“Hurry and tell me why you're calling them.”

“Because it would be beneficial for both sides.”

“Don’t you know how rude they are? They look down on people like it’s nothing. How can you call Hyun-woo to such a place?”

“Well, they are the ones who will take over their own companies eventually. It would be good for Hyun-woo to get acquainted with the advertisers.”

Of course, he was also calling Lee Hyun-woo to show off a bit, but there was another purpose.

‘If he becomes part of our family later, he needs to get used to the atmosphere.’

But he didn’t say that to Kim Ah-young.

Instead,

“Honestly, we owe Hyun-woo a bit. I think this is a good way to repay him.”

As he spoke soothingly, Kim Ah-young showed a complicated expression.

‘You have nothing to say, right? Because what I’m saying is true.’

Come to think of it, his sister seemed to like Lee Hyun-woo.

When he talked about something good for Lee Hyun-woo, she, who always refuted, kept her mouth shut.

Right now, he strangely envied her.

‘Damn, can I also marry a woman I like?’

Somehow, he felt he couldn't.

‘Sigh…’

He sighed inwardly.

* * *

That afternoon, Lee Hyun-woo received another call from Kim Tae-hyun.

The date was the next day, and the location was the Seorabeol Hotel.

‘This is it.’

Honestly, it wasn't something he was thrilled about.

It felt like he was getting more entangled with the Guseong family.

Even though he felt uneasy, there was a reason he accepted.

He wanted to know if Guseong was really acquiring Geukdong Gas.

If that happened, their entry into the automobile industry would be delayed, and the risk of over-investment in the future would be reduced.

In his past life, due to Guseong's entry into the automobile industry, other domestic automobile companies executed more development and facility investments.

So, if these parts headed in a different direction, he felt that the small flutter of a butterfly's wings could calm the storm of the financial crisis.

‘And for Ah-young's sake, I’ll go along this time.’

Last year and this year.

He realized that she was changing a lot to match him.

Watching that process, he found Kim Ah-young slowly entering his heart.

‘At this rate, I might actually fall for her.’

Now, instead of thinking ‘why it can't work,’ he started thinking ‘is there really a reason it shouldn't work?’

Then he heard the phone ring again and chuckled.

‘Since her oppa called, the younger sister will contact me again.’

This morning, Kim Ah-young had said the same thing.

Telling him there was no need to listen to her brother.

But since he had already made up his mind, he thought of telling her he had made his decision as he answered the phone,

(Hello?)

Unexpectedly, it was Choi Sun-hwa from the Aejung Group.

“Oh? Long time no see.”

(It’s not really been that long. Every time I’ve called to ask you to make some time, you’ve always turned me down.)

Suddenly, he recalled the times he had received Choi Sun-hwa's calls last year and this year.

Strangely, something had always come up on those days.

Recently, it was the day Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo returned from abroad.

― You told me to contact you after work, but today doesn’t work either.

― Really sorry. Contact me in advance next time.

So, she must have contacted him before he even got off work today.

‘Coincidentally, something always came up.’

Feeling sorry, he thought he should make it up.

“Ah, I’m sorry. I should treat you to something big.”

(Oh, trying to act nice without even checking if I’m available today.)

It felt like she was saying,

So you thought I would just come running?

Lee Hyun-woo smiled as he responded to her words.

“I didn’t mean today. Of course, today works too. Oh, and tomorrow won’t work. Thinking about it, the day after tomorrow won’t work either.”

(Tch… Fine. I’ll come over now.)

Eventually, Choi Sun-hwa gave up.

(But you owe me a drink today.)

* * *

Choi Sun-hwa was a huge client of Jungle.

Not only because of the advertising, but also because the low-priced cosmetics had become a big hit, making her one of the most influential figures in online shopping.

However, she had never exercised power over Lee Hyun-woo.

Rather, she had called him several times to treat him to delicious food, thanks to his advice that led to her success.

After all those failed attempts, today she got to have a drink with him.

And it was at a bar in Gangnam.

“Did I suggest too fancy a place?”

“No, it’s fine.”

“Alright then. You make a lot of money, so you must treat me today.”

Sometimes she was too straightforward, but that was her charm.

Lee Hyun-woo smiled and nodded.

“Of course I should. But you’re doing quite well too. These days, I see MISS. A ads everywhere I go.”

MISS. A is Aejung Cosmetics' low-cost brand.

Catching the change in consumer trends accurately, it was gaining sensational popularity among teenage and twenty-something women.

“It’s all thanks to your advice. Like you said, a moment's choice determines a decade of success. Because I followed your advice to plan a low-cost brand, this is the result.”

“Wow, so you’re admitting you’re making a lot of money. No, you should treat me.”

“Okay, you rascal.”

Though they had met the least number of times, thanks to her straightforward personality, they quickly became close.

Maybe that's why Lee Hyun-woo felt like he was meeting a male friend rather than a female one.

“By the way, did you expect the low-cost brand to become this popular?”

“Of course. Cosmetics are too expensive, especially for teenagers and those in their twenties. But if you remove just a bit of the markup, it would catch on quickly. As you know, the markup is ridiculous. The sales commission alone accounts for over 40% of the consumer price.”

“Wow, you know so much.”

“I know a bit. Plus, the advertising and promotional costs are 25%, and distribution and marketing costs are another 25%. So, they’re inflating the price tenfold.”

“You should also subtract the research and development costs.”

“Research and development costs? In the premium market, R&D costs are significant, but for low-cost cosmetics, they replace the ingredients with more economical ones.”

“This is crazy. I can’t deceive you.”

Though speaking casually, Choi Sun-hwa was increasingly surprised.

Lee Hyun-woo was only twenty-eight.

What on earth had he done before to know so much about the pricing and distribution structure of cosmetics?

“And recently, door-to-door sales aren't as effective, and the premium market in department stores is relatively in a slump, right?”

“Did you ever work for a cosmetics company?”

“No. I studied it a bit in college.”

“You studied that?”

“Yes, I researched the cases of different products.”

It was hard to believe, but that’s what he said, so what could she do?

However,

“Theory and practice are different, aren’t they?”

This was the lingering question.

“Has anyone succeeded in applying theory to practice as much as I have?”

“So, all your businesses were like that?”

“Of course.”

“Honestly, I have nothing else to say but amazing.”

“Of course.”

“Then what's the next big thing? What do you think will be the next big hit?”

“Do you think I’ll reveal such secrets for free?”

“No way. Drink! Drink! Spill some secrets after drinking.”

Today, it was expensive whiskey.

She was determined to get him to treat her, so she ordered it, and as she sipped it bit by bit, her eyes began to show a slight flush.

Seeing that, Lee Hyun-woo flinched.

Recently, Kim Ah-young had shown him a similar look.
