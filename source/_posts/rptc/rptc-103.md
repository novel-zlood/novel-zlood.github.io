As the end of the workday approached, Lee Hyun-woo donned his coat and headed out.

While starting his car in the parking lot, he saw Kim Yoon-soo walking towards the company entrance.

Quickly rolling down the window, he looked at him.

"Hyung!"

"Oh? President Lee? Where are you going?"

"Yes, I have a quick errand to run."

"Ah, what a shame. I should have called."

"What's the matter?"

"Today, the line finally got completed. Since the day to start modem production is imminent, I came to report to you."

"Wow, already? Then I must drop by later. I'm curious about it."

"Sure, drive safely."

Kim Yoon-soo said goodbye with a look of regret on his face.

Lee Hyun-woo gently pressed the accelerator after rolling up the window.

'Thank goodness. Things are going well there too.'

In fact, 【One Computer】, thanks to its acquaintance with Lee Hyun-woo, was one of the companies, aside from 【Jungle】, rapidly on the path to success.

Once the mass production of modems began, orders from companies dealing with high-speed internet in the country would flood in, and 【One Computer】 would achieve tremendous success.

'Not only there, but 【Alpha Cast】 and 【Samjin Computer】 will also see results soon, right?'

The former was on the brink of producing MP3 players, while the latter was about to start testing high-speed internet.

Achieving such business overnight was impossible, but both companies had the know-how.

【Alpha Cast】 was well-versed in related technology through car stereos, and 【Samjin Computer】 had already had extensive discussions with cable TV.

'At this rate, Korea's IT ecosystem might surpass the US.'

It's not impossible.

Then, the foreign capital investments Lee Hyun-woo had hoped for would become more active.

The capital that flowed out like a receding tide during the past foreign exchange crisis could surge in like a flood this time.

Thinking about it again, it's about countering bubbles with bubbles.

'Well, not everything goes the way I want.'

Just like 【Bohan Group】 and the soon-to-be bankrupt 【Misam Group】.

Many companies will fall and collapse.

But if new IT groups solidly fill the void, and the existing conglomerates become more solidified?

‘Maybe we won't have to invoke the IMF?’

Personally, Lee Hyun-woo thought that just because a foreign exchange crisis occurred, it wasn't necessary to rely on the IMF.

Because the IMF demanded too harsh a price.

It could be overcome through labor-management cooperation, like the Singapore or Malaysia model.

‘If it goes this way, it will be both interesting and rewarding.’

A mission impossible to realize in a previous life.

This time, he intended to give it a try.

Even if it’s just for fun, Lee Hyun-woo always tackled things seriously in his past life and always reached the goal of success.

Considering the steps, today was the time to shake the chairman of 【Guseong Group】.

‘I have to win over Kim Sung-moo's heart unconditionally!’

Having read and almost memorized his autobiography dozens of times, Lee Hyun-woo was confident.

Realizing this, he noticed he was gripping the steering wheel tightly.

After avoiding traffic, he soon arrived at Kim Sung-moo's residence, took a deep breath, and got out of the car.

* * *

A little later, Lee Hyun-woo entered a house large enough to be described as a palace.

"Welcome. Ah, this is my father."

"Nice to meet you."

"And this is my mother."

"Nice to meet you."

"These are my siblings. You know Ah-young, and this is Kim Ah-jin. She’s studying abroad but is back in Korea for vacation. And this is Kim Na-yoon, a senior in high school."

When introduced to Kim Tae-hyun's younger sisters, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and nodded lightly.

Then,

"Alright, let's have dinner first."

At Kim Sung-moo's word, everyone turned in the direction he indicated.

‘There must be a dining table over there.’

The house was so spacious that one had to remember where everything was.

Even going to the restroom and coming back, one might get lost trying to find their seat.

With this thought, Lee Hyun-woo approached the dining table, and Kim Tae-hyun kindly prepared a seat for him.

"Very few people have dined with our entire family at this table. Consider yourself honored."

"Yes, hyung."

"Hey, don't overdo it. It’s not like we're dining with some great people."

Kim Sung-moo's wife, Jang Hee-jin, said this to Kim Tae-hyun with a laugh.

Looking at this, it seemed more like an ordinary family rather than a conglomerate’s household.

‘Did they stage this for me?’

Or maybe the house atmosphere was bright because the daughters were still unmarried.

During the meal, the daughters showed various interests.

"You’re incredible, aren’t you? You started your company last year and have already become a market leader, partnering with foreign companies and expanding overseas?"

"I don't know about other things, but my classmates use 【Jungle Music】 a lot. Recently, there’s a promotion where you get 300 coins for a 10,000 won top-up, so they use it even more."

"Hyun-woo, I can't eat. Stop it."

Luckily, Kim Tae-hyun intervened.

Then Kim Ah-young quickly stepped in to calm the situation.

"Guys, you'll have time to ask questions after he talks with dad. Don’t worry."

In any situation, Lee Hyun-woo just smiled without opening his mouth.

Why?

Kim Sung-moo didn't like people who talked a lot on the first meeting.

It was written in his autobiography, and Kim Ah-young had also said so.

‘I need to trust the autobiography and Ah-young.’

Instead, he answered clearly when asked.

"Do you think our country can experience another period of rapid growth?"

"It's difficult. The government-led growth strategy has already hit its limit."

"But hasn't political democratization promoted economic liberalization and openness? One could say a new market has opened."

"Of course. However, if the economic players think differently, we might lose our market."

"Right. The voice of labor unions and civic groups has strengthened in government policies and issues, leading to conflicts of interest between the government and businesses."

"Therefore, leadership is needed to guide these diversified economic players. I have always thought of you, Chairman, as someone who can resolve these conflicts and reconcile interests."

"Hahaha, I don't like stepping forward. And these days, it seems one must be cautious. You might be accused of collusion between politics and business if you stand out."

Lee Hyun-woo skillfully diverted or avoided sensitive topics.

Even now.

Although he nodded vaguely, it didn't mean he fully agreed with Chairman Kim Sung-moo's words.

The reason he pointed to Chairman Kim Sung-moo as the person to resolve conflicts was something only Lee Hyun-woo knew.

‘If you step forward and let go of many things, the conflicts will disappear.’

But he continued the conversation without showing his true thoughts, maintaining a submissive demeanor until the meal ended.

At some point, only Chairman Kim Sung-moo and Lee Hyun-woo were talking, leading Jang Hee-jin to shake her head and say,

"You probably didn't know whether the food went into your nose or ears. Such heavy topics should be discussed after the meal."

However, the post-meal conversation continued in Chairman Kim Sung-moo's office.

With just the two of them inside, without any interruptions.

* * *

"Recently, I happened to see a blog. It's called Nostradamus... You know it, right?"

"Yes, I know. It’s run by an anonymous user who spreads exaggerated and misleading information."

"Hahaha, exaggerated and misleading, you say."

Did Lee Hyun-woo's words please him?

For now, Kim Sung-moo chuckled and sipped his tea.

"Okay, good. As you said, I don't know if it's exaggerated and misleading, but as times change, people learn more and want to share what they know. Moreover, recently, they have a platform to speak on. That's the internet."

"You're absolutely right."

"In that space, one can thoroughly hide their identity. For example, I could post something pretending to be someone else."

"That's called anonymity."

"Right. But isn't it curious? One of the internet's characteristics is openness. Yet, within it, there's the closed nature of anonymity."

Through this conversation, Lee Hyun-woo subtly understood what the chairman wanted.

‘He wants to know the identity of Nostradamus.’

Lee Hyun-woo smiled and looked at Kim Sung-moo.

"You're absolutely right. Anonymity and openness coexist curiously. Even I sometimes get confused about whether I'm running the portal site in the right direction."

"Hmm..."

"So sometimes, I feel frustrated and want to tell someone about the identity of Nostradamus."

At that moment, Kim Sung-moo's sharp eyes focused on Lee Hyun-woo's face.

"You mean you know."

"Of course, I know. I’ve known for a long time."

"Long time, you say..."

"Yes, I knew even before the blog was started."

"......"

This time, his eyes slightly widened.

"It seems you know Nostradamus well."

"Yes, that's right."

"And you feel the need to protect this person."

"Not necessarily."

"No need to protect?"

"He hasn't committed any crimes, has he? He just finds it very bothersome to be known to the world."

Lee Hyun-woo was speaking accurately because he was Nostradamus.

If this were revealed, it would undoubtedly attract too much attention.

"But I can tell you, Chairman."

"......"

Kim Sung-moo, who was cautious in human relationships, didn't easily reveal his inner thoughts, but now he was very curious.

However,

"What do you want?"

Instead of asking who, he asked what Lee Hyun-woo desired.

Thinking that he would demand something significant for revealing and protecting such a person.

But Lee Hyun-woo, still with a relaxed smile, said,

"I mentioned it during the meal. At this current point where conflicts and clashes of interest among economic players arise, I wish you would lead our country's economy well."

"What?"

"I'm not in a position to tell you what to do. I've expressed my wishes, so now I'll reveal the identity of Nostradamus."

"......"

The cozy, comfortable office, designed for his health, was now tense.

Naturally, Chairman Kim Sung-moo's curiosity had reached its peak.

In a way, Lee Hyun-woo's adeptness at manipulating the giant of the business world was truly impressive.

Even now, he stopped speaking at the appropriate 'timing,'

"Actually, Ah-young is Nostradamus."

"......!"

Kim Sung-moo, who rarely lost his composure, had a look of shock in his eyes.
