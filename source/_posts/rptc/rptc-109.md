First of all, Lee Hyun-woo evaluated the news of 【Misam Group】's bankruptcy not being heard yet in this way.

‘The time difference between my past life and this life can't be the same.’

Still, it wasn't bad.

In his previous life, it was the second big company to go bankrupt after 【Bohan Group】, and the market shock became more severe due to the successive bankruptcies of major companies.

The won-dollar exchange rate also quickly felt the impact and rose too sharply, causing the media to make a fuss,

『Exchange rate stable at 870 won level』

Rather, he wished it would rise a little more.

Wouldn't it be successful if we could prevent or avoid a foreign exchange crisis at this rate?

Of course, Lee Hyun-woo thought it wasn't because of his own efforts.

‘Just as the song of the previous life changes completely in this life, it seems that the scenario of Korea in this life has started to change from a certain point.’

It wasn't bad.

However, he couldn't afford to be complacent, so he checked the news every day and finally saw the fruits of the seeds he planted last month.

『Han Jung-su family had secretly pushed for the sale of 【Geukdong Gas】!』

This meant that 【Geukdong Gas】 could no longer be sold.

Therefore, 【Bohan Group】, which was on the verge of disbandment, had to transparently sell 【Geukdong Gas】, and the discovery of the Siberian gas field increased the value of this company, attracting the interest of many companies.

Among them was 【Guseong】.

‘Huh? It's flowing like this again.’

The value of Russia's gas can only increase over time.

Even if one did not know the future like Lee Hyun-woo, any company in our country that is always thirsty for fossil fuels could predict this.

So, it was inevitable that a conglomerate with financial resources would attempt to acquire it.

‘Is Ayoung's father really going to buy this company?’

If so, the concerns about overlapping investments that he worried about last time would somewhat subside.

Thinking this far, a small smile hung on his face.

And then, he couldn't help but laugh as he looked at the IT news that followed.

『【GB Electronics】 also puts all efforts into making servers!』

『【Daeun】 jumps into the server market!』

Even if conservatively estimated, if the probability of a foreign exchange crisis has decreased, his influence would be about 1%,

‘This is definitely the crazy butterfly effect I've caused.’

He was certainly having an impact in the IT sector.

The servers were something Lee Hyun-woo had advised Kim Tae-hyun about, and among domestic companies, 【Guseong Electronics】 was leading.

There was originally a saying that if 【Guseong】 did something, 【GB】 would also do it.

The reverse was also true.

As they were rival companies in the industry, it was natural that 【GB】 would jump into servers.

In this situation where stories of oversupply of computers were already emerging, it seemed natural to enter a period of adjustment.

* * *

At that time, in Kim Sung-moo's office.

“Not only domestically, but foreign companies also seem to be betting boldly.”

Kim Sung-moo was listening to a report from his chief secretary about 【Geukdong Gas】.

“The acquisition price will go up.”

“That's correct. Originally, it was about 60 billion won, but now it's jumped by 10 billion won.”

“What if we pour all available funds into it?”

“Then... we might have to reduce the budget for automobiles.”

“Hmm...”

Originally, automobiles were Kim Sung-moo's long-cherished project.

A few years ago, he began preliminary work and received a manufacturing business license from the government.

However,

‘The money that has gone in so far is less than the money that will go in from now on.’

Kim Sung-moo felt the need to adjust the speed for a moment and let out a small sigh inwardly.

‘Sigh...’

The head of a large group carries a heavy burden.

Many things were hanging on it.

Among them, the greatest were responsibility and ambition, which constantly intersected.

“What is your opinion?”

“The Siberian gas field will immediately connect to profits. And it is certain that we will recover more than the invested funds within a few years.”

“That is... true.”

“Moreover, since the automobile business already has the authorization, we can produce complete cars sooner or later, even if it's delayed a bit. But acquiring 【Geukdong Gas】 now will not be easy if we miss this opportunity.”

Although he spoke at length, it meant they had to reduce investments in building automobile factories, production facilities, and R&D costs.

“Got it. Instead, tell the working team to bring in 【Geukdong Gas】 at all costs.”

“Yes, Chairman.”

After making such a tough decision, fatigue always followed.

Of course, it had always been like that, but it became more severe after a certain point.

Kim Sung-moo thought he knew when that was.

‘Lee Hyun-woo, that guy... really...’

At first, he was puzzled by the reason.

What had a guy who was only twenty-eight years old done?

Why did talking with him complicate his thoughts?

Later, after asking himself, he could identify the cause.

While talking with Lee Hyun-woo, Kim Sung-moo saw opportunities in crises.

― Chairman, I think 【Guseong Group】's path lies in IT. That’s why I mentioned servers and MP3 mobile phones to Tae-hyun hyung.

After revealing that his daughter was Nostradamus, the guy continued to unfold his aspirations.

― If 【Jungle】 makes remarkable progress in the software sector, I want to partner with 【Guseong】 to transform our entire country into Silicon Valley.

Even though he was young, why did he believe it was possible?

The surprising thing was the performance of 【Jungle】 that followed.

It was connecting with companies whose names everyone knew in Japan, the U.S., Germany, etc.

‘I don't know about other things, but he certainly is capable.’

So, he increasingly became greedy.

The more he thought of it as an opportunity to engrave 【Guseong Group】 in blue on the world economic power map, the more he felt so.

‘That’s why my thoughts are complicated. Is this a warning signal or an opportunity to grasp an unimaginable enormous power?’

In other words, if he misstepped, he could plunge the empire built since his father's time into ruin, which made his thoughts complicated.

He reached a subtle conclusion.

‘Should I keep that guy by my side?’

The assessment Kim Sung-moo made after meeting Lee Hyun-woo last time was just one.

If only he were my man.

That’s why he had been secretly investigating him using the group’s secretariat since then.

The conclusion was that he had lived as a prodigy, became an outstanding talent, and turned into a genius of the era.

His family background was nothing special, but his private life was impeccably clean.

The interesting point was his recent connection with his daughter Kim Ayoung.

This was something he learned more about through Jeong Jin-seong, who was his bodyguard and then went to Kim Ayoung.

― At first, they started dating at a pub in Jongno.

― So, does that mean they are dating?

― No, but it is clear they have mutual interest. Last month, they went on several dates in Jeju Island, and after CEO Lee Hyun-woo greeted you, Miss Ayoung frequented 【Jungle】 headquarters more often.

Though they were not dating yet, it could be said they were almost on the verge of dating.

Of course, as a father with a daughter, Kim Ayoung was much more precious than Lee Hyun-woo.

But it certainly seemed better for her to marry Lee Hyun-woo than to give her to another guy.

‘No, it’s not her marrying off; it’s him coming into the family.’

At this point, Kim Sung-moo had to be certain.

He was slightly anxious about entrusting 【Guseong Group】 to his only son and eldest, but what if Lee Hyun-woo assisted Kim Tae-hyun well?

‘Yes, I would feel much more relieved.’

What would Lee Hyun-woo say if he knew this thought?

― The person who gives rice cakes isn't even thinking about it, but you're drinking kimchi soup.

* * *

The next morning.

Kim Tae-hyun, who had come home late, rubbed his eyes and sat at the dining table.

Already feeling embarrassed as someone else was there first, he heard Kim Sung-moo's voice.

“You drank a lot yesterday.”

“Well... it was a long time since I saw Uncle Jae-won. You know, Dad. Uncle has been continuously arguing about the danger of a strong dollar since he returned from the U.S., so I wanted to understand why he thinks that way.”

Uncle Jang Jae-won was the youngest brother of the owner of 【Sejong Daily】.

He had been a correspondent in the U.S. and recently returned to work in Korea.

Kim Sung-moo recalled what Jang Jae-won had said during last New Year's.

Indeed, he had warned about the dangers of a strong dollar.

‘Come to think of it, it’s similar to what was said on the Nostradamus blog.’

It was a warning that fit perfectly with Kim Sung-moo's crisis management philosophy.

At the same time, he glanced at Kim Ayoung.

‘Is she really that Nostradamus?’

When he met Lee Hyun-woo last time, Kim Sung-moo had no choice but to believe what he said.

But now, there were continuously suspicious aspects.

Setting aside other matters, wouldn’t parents know their own child?

‘Even if Ayoung has economic insights beyond my expectations, it’s too early for her to discuss policies related to Japan and Germany as shown by Nostradamus.’

To grasp that level, one needed to accumulate tremendous experience.

That too in international trade.

‘Did that guy deceive me?’

There was no reason he couldn't, so after breakfast, he called Kim Tae-hyun to his office.

“Do you remember when Hyun-woo came to our house last time?”

“Yes, father.”

“At that time, he said Ayoung was Nostradamus.”

“Yes? Really?”

Kim Tae-hyun's pupils, blurred by the lingering effects of alcohol, expanded significantly.

It showed how surprised his son was.

“Can you believe it?”

“I've repeatedly read the blog contents. Ayoung isn't at that level.”

“What if she was deliberately hiding her abilities?”

“Father, you know Ayoung. Especially how she always tries not to lose to me. If she had accurately predicted the various financial outcomes, would we not have known until now?”

Kim Tae-hyun recalled specific examples after composing himself.

“Thinking back, whenever we or Uncle or other relatives discussed things, she always butted in. She revealed shallow experience.”

“That's true. That's why I'm suspicious. It takes at least ten years of hands-on experience in the global market to predict the chain reactions in finance.”

“Hyun-woo must have fabricated something. Understand him, father. I've met him a few times, and he’s very protective of his personal information.”

“If he lied, it’s slightly audacious... but I don’t intend to reproach him for that. But I am rather suspicious of him.”

“Yes? What do you mean... Could Hyun-woo be Nostradamus?”

Kim Sung-moo nodded.

“Yes. When I talked with him back then, I felt his understanding of finance and international trade was truly remarkable.”

“Hmm...”

“Even if he isn’t Nostradamus, his capabilities make me crave him. What do you think? How about keeping him by your side later on?”

“……!”
