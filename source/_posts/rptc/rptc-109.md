Lee Hyun-woo evaluated the fact that there was no news of the bankruptcy of 【Misam Group】 in this way.

"There's no way the timeline of my past life and this life could be the same."

Still, it wasn't bad.

In his previous life, it was the second major company to go bankrupt after 【Bohan Group】, and the continuous bankruptcies of large companies increasingly shocked the market.

The won-dollar exchange rate also quickly felt the impact and rose too sharply, causing the media to make a fuss.

『Exchange rate stabilized at 870 won』

He even hoped it would rise a bit more.

"Could I be succeeding in preventing or avoiding a foreign exchange crisis?"

Of course, Lee Hyun-woo thought it wasn't because of his efforts.

"Just as songs from past lives completely change in the present life, the scenario of this life’s South Korea must have started to change at some point."

It wasn't bad.

However, he didn't let his guard down and checked the news daily. Finally, he could see the fruit of the seeds sown last month.

『Han Jung-soo's family secretly pushed to sell 【Geukdong Gas】!』

This meant they could no longer sell 【Geukdong Gas】.

Therefore, 【Bohan Group】, which was on the verge of dissolving, had to transparently sell 【Geukdong Gas】, whose value had risen due to the discovery of a Siberian gas field, attracting many interested companies.

Among them was 【Guseong】.

"What? This is how it's going?"

The value of Russia's gas can only rise.

Even without knowing the future like Lee Hyun-woo, any company in our country, which is always thirsty for fossil fuels, could predict this.

Thus, conglomerates with financial power had no choice but to attempt an acquisition.

"Is Ah-young's father really going to buy this company?"

If so, the concern about excessive overlapping investments he had worried about before would be somewhat alleviated.

With this thought, a small smile hung on his face.

Then he couldn't help but laugh as he read the following IT news.

『【GB Electronics】 puts all efforts into creating servers!』

『【Daewoon】 jumps into the server market!』

Even considering conservatively, the probability of a foreign exchange crisis decreasing should have about 1% of his influence.

"This is definitely my crazy butterfly effect."

In the IT sector, he was certainly having an influence.

The server was advised by Lee Hyun-woo to Kim Tae-hyun, and among domestic companies, 【Guseong Electronics】 was leading the way.

There was a saying that if 【Guseong】 did it, so did 【GB】.

The opposite was also true.

Since the two companies were industry rivals, it was natural for 【GB】 to jump into the server market.

Even in this situation where there was already talk of an oversupply of computers, it seemed to naturally enter an adjustment period.

* * *

At that time, in Kim Sung-moo's office.

"Domestic companies and foreign companies alike seem to be making bold bets."

Kim Sung-moo was receiving a report on 【Geukdong Gas】 from his chief secretary.

"The acquisition price will go up."

"Yes, originally it was about 60 billion won, but now it has jumped by another 10 billion won."

"What happens if we pour all our available funds into it?"

"Then... we would probably have to reduce the budget for the automobile sector."

"Hmm..."

Originally, automobiles were Kim Sung-moo's long-cherished project.

He had started preparatory work years ago and received government approval for manufacturing.

However,

"The money that has been spent so far is less than the money that will be needed in the future."

Kim Sung-moo felt the need to adjust the pace for a moment and let out a small sigh internally.

"Sigh..."

The head of a giant group carries a heavy burden.

There were many things hanging on it.

Among them, the biggest were responsibility and ambition, and now those two were constantly intersecting.

"What is your opinion?"

"The Siberian gas field is something that will lead to immediate profits. And it is certain that we will recover more than the invested funds within a few years."

"That's true..."

"Moreover, since we have already obtained approval for the automobile business, we can still produce complete cars even if it's delayed a bit. But acquiring 【Geukdong Gas】 won't be easy if we don't do it now."

Although he spoke at length, it meant reducing the investment in building the car factory, production facilities, and R&D costs.

"Got it. Tell the working team to bring in 【Geukdong Gas】 no matter what."

"Yes, Chairman."

After making tough decisions, fatigue always set in.

Of course, it had always been the case, but it had become more severe after a certain point.

Kim Sung-moo seemed to know when that was.

"Lee Hyun-woo, that guy..."

At first, he was bewildered by the reason.

"What could a guy who is just twenty-eight have done?"

"Why did my mind become so complicated after talking to him?"

Later, after asking himself, he could identify the reason.

While talking to Lee Hyun-woo, Kim Sung-moo saw opportunities amidst crises.

― "Chairman, I believe the future of 【Guseong Group】 lies in IT. That's why I mentioned servers and MP3 mobile phones to Tae-hyun hyung."

After revealing that his daughter was Nostradamus, the guy continued to unfold his ambitions.

― "If 【Jungle】 makes significant progress in software, I want to join hands with 【Guseong】 and turn the entire country into Silicon Valley."

Even though he was young, why did he believe it was possible?

The surprising thing was the subsequent achievements of 【Jungle】.

They were connecting with companies known by name in Japan, the US, and Germany.

"I don't know about anything else, but he's definitely capable."

So, the desire gradually grew.

The more he thought about the opportunity to mark 【Guseong Group】 in blue on the world economic power map, the more he felt it.

"That's why my mind is complicated. Is this a warning signal or an opportunity to grasp unimaginable power?"

In other words, his thoughts were complicated by the fact that a single misstep could bring the empire built by his predecessors to ruin.

He reached a quiet conclusion.

"Should I keep that guy by my side?"

After meeting Lee Hyun-woo last time, Kim Sung-moo's evaluation was just one.

"I wish he were my person."

Therefore, he had mobilized the group's secretarial office to investigate him since then.

The conclusion was that he had lived as a prodigy, become a talent, and turned into a genius of the era.

The only flaw was his unremarkable family background, but his private life was impeccably clean.

An interesting point was his recent interaction with his daughter, Kim Ah-young, over the past few months.

This was further discovered through Jeong Jin-seong, who had been his bodyguard and then went to Kim Ah-young.

― "At first, they started dating at a pub in Jongno."

― "So, are they dating?"

― "No, but they clearly have mutual interest. Last month, they went on several dates in Jeju Island, and after CEO Lee Hyun-woo greeted you, the young lady has been visiting 【Jungle】's headquarters more often."

They might not be dating yet, but it was almost on the verge of a relationship at this level.

Of course, as the father of a daughter, he felt Kim Ah-young was much more than Lee Hyun-woo.

Still, it seemed better for her to marry Lee Hyun-woo than any other guy.

"No, not marry her off, but have him come into the family."

At this point, Kim Sung-moo had to be sure of one thing.

He was slightly uneasy about entrusting 【Guseong Group】 to his only son and eldest child, but if Lee Hyun-woo could support Kim Tae-hyun well?

"Yes, I could be more at ease."

If Lee Hyun-woo knew this thought, what would he say?

― "You're drinking kimchi soup before the rice cake is even offered."

* * *

The next morning.

Kim Tae-hyun, who came in late, rubbed his eyes and sat at the dining table.

Already feeling awkward as there were others present, he heard Kim Sung-moo's voice.

"You drank a lot yesterday."

"Well, it’s been a while since I met Uncle Jae-won. You know, he’s been constantly warning about the risks of a strong dollar since he returned from the US, so I wanted to understand why he thinks that way."

His maternal uncle, Jang Jae-won, was the youngest brother of the owner of 【Sejong Daily】.

He had been a correspondent in the US and recently returned to work in Korea.

Kim Sung-moo recalled what Jang Jae-won had said during the last New Year.

Indeed, he had warned about the risks of a strong dollar.

"Come to think of it, it's similar to what was said on the Nostradamus blog."

It was a warning that perfectly matched Kim Sung-moo's philosophy of crisis management.

At the same time, he looked at Kim Ah-young.

"Is she really Nostradamus?"

When he met Lee Hyun-woo last time, Kim Sung-moo had no choice but to believe what he said.

However, now he was discovering more suspicious aspects.

Leaving aside other things, wouldn't parents know their child?

"Even if Ah-young has economic insights beyond my expectations, it's too early for her to discuss policies of Japan and Germany as shown by Nostradamus."

To grasp that level, one would need to accumulate tremendous experience.

That too, in the field of international trade.

"Did he deceive me?"

It wasn't impossible, so after the meal, he called Kim Tae-hyun to his office.

"Remember when Hyun-woo came to our house last time?"

"Yes, Father."

"At that time, he said Nostradamus was Ah-young."

"What? Really?"

Kim Tae-hyun's pupils, which had been blurred by alcohol, widened significantly.

It showed how surprised his son, Kim Tae-hyun, was.

"Can you believe it?"

"I’ve read the blog contents multiple times, and Ah-young isn't at that level."

"What if she was deliberately hiding her abilities?"

"Father, you know Ah-young. Especially her competitive nature against me. If she had accurately predicted the various financial outcomes, would we have not known by now?"

Kim Tae-hyun regained his composure and brought up specific cases.

"Thinking back, whenever we had conversations between you, me, Uncle, or other elder relatives, she would always butt in. And she would expose her shallow experience."

"That's right. That's why I also have doubts. Predicting the chain reactions in finance requires at least ten years of practical experience in the global market."

"Hyun-woo must have made it up. Understand, Father. I've met him several times, and he’s very protective of his personal information."

"If he lied, it’s a bit annoying... but I don't plan to hold it against him. But, you know, I’m rather suspicious of that guy."

"Are you saying Hyun-woo is Nostradamus?"

Kim Sung-moo nodded.

"Yes. When I talked to him back then, I felt his understanding of finance and international trade was exceptional."

"Hmm..."

"Because of this, I became more interested in him, even if he isn’t Nostradamus. What do you think about having him by your side in the future?"

"……!"
