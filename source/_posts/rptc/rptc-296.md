Gumanhoe's performance exceeded expectations.

Not only did he reach out to private companies and banks, but even public enterprises and public institutions.

‘At this point, I must really have a knack for finding talented people.’

A broad smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo’s face.

If things continued like this, the job platform would be established, opening a new type of employment market.

However, good things always come with some setbacks.

Some time later, a media outlet published an article targeting Jungle’s job platform, claiming that a giant information technology company was crushing a venture business.

What was absurd was that the venture business mentioned in the article was Online Headhunter.

Gumanhoe came storming in, fuming with anger.

“How can this be? The company that took over ours through a fraudulent contract is now dragging our website into this?”

“Calm down. It’s not even a widely-read newspaper,”

Lee Hyun-woo reassured Gumanhoe.

In fact, this article came from one of the numerous online media outlets that have sprung up recently, and it seemed to be written just for the clicks.

These days, clicks translate to money.

‘The truth will come out eventually, but it takes too much time.’

Lee Hyun-woo immediately summoned his secretaries.

He instructed those who had close ties with the media to correct the article.

Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho began making calls.

Of course, they didn’t contact the company that criticized Jungle but reached out to other media outlets.

“Jungle, launching free job website for re-employment services”

“Lee Hyun-woo emphasizes the social role of IT companies, operating a 100% free employment website!”

They spread the message that the intent was to tackle the sudden rise in unemployment in Korean society, and they also highlighted that Online Headhunter was originally Gumanhoe’s company.

They emphasized that the company was taken over through a fraudulent contract.

As a result, a flood of comments poured in.

Most were supportive of Jungle, Lee Hyun-woo, and Gumanhoe, and critical of Online Headhunter.

Eventually, comments vowing not to use Online Headhunter increased.

Seeing the worsening public opinion, the other side was thrown into chaos and quickly contacted Jungle.

“CEO, the representative over there wants to meet you. He wants to apologize in person.”

Lee Hyun-woo nodded at the message conveyed by Han Se-jin.

“An apology, huh…”

“I think he means to announce to the media that he apologized.”

“That makes sense. Then tell them we will accept the apology. But Gumanhoe will go on our behalf.”

“Haha…”

Han Se-jin, who hadn’t laughed like this in front of Lee Hyun-woo since becoming the chief secretary, couldn’t contain his laughter this time.

It was no wonder since sending Gumanhoe out was almost like declaring war.

Han Se-jin thought to himself,

‘In reality, the chances of Gumanhoe getting the company back are extremely low.’

Therefore, it seemed Lee Hyun-woo was considering this as a way to let Gumanhoe vent his frustration.

Although it seemed childish to anyone, Gumanhoe’s expressions and demeanor changed when he heard Lee Hyun-woo’s proposal.

“Me… really, can I go?”

“Yes. Although the representative over there is someone the investors put in place and may not have directly wronged you, go and make sure he understands. Make it clear that he should never mess with Jungle again.”

“……Yes, I understand.”

Gumanhoe deeply felt that the CEO was considering him once again.

It was something he could understand even if it wasn’t conveyed in a sophisticated manner.

“And perhaps this incident will lead Online Headhunter downhill.”

“Probably.”

“Then I’m considering acquiring it.”

“What? Why…”

They already had a job platform, so why would they need Online Headhunter?

“They must have accumulated some know-how there, right? It would be beneficial for our company to absorb and utilize it better. Don’t you think?”

“That… that’s true…”

As things had progressed this way, Gumanhoe could certainly see the strategic moves and arrangements Lee Hyun-woo was making.

The way to bring experienced key talents was to take those who had grown thick in that field, and Lee Hyun-woo was considering taking the entire company.

Others might see it as inefficient, but Gumanhoe didn’t think so.

The cost of training a single new employee, as measured by the talent development department, exceeded 100 million won.

With more than 20 experienced employees working at Online Headhunter, the investment value seemed sufficient.

Moreover, they could also absorb the recruitment infrastructure that had been operated so far, so acquiring it at a reasonable price wouldn’t be a bad thing.

‘In that case, I need to be even more assertive.’

Even Gumanhoe, known for his good nature, would have never imagined the day would come when he would put on airs in front of the representative of Online Headhunter.

* * *

A few days later, Gumanhoe attended the meeting, thinking that at the very least, he could vent his frustrations, if not seek revenge.

But things didn’t go as expected.

“First, I want to apologize. Unintentionally, I ended up taking your position and stealing your dream.”

The person’s name was Yoon Jun.

He was around the same age as Gumanhoe, but the arrogance that had previously shown on his face was completely gone.

“It’s the same with this incident. We had no intention at all. It was just an article written freely by a journalist. I even called that journalist because we were in trouble due to that incident.”

“Oh, I see…”

“Please convey this to the CEO of Jungle. Honestly, everyday life has become tough recently. Not long ago, companies were lining up to advertise…”

Although he didn’t finish his sentence, Gumanhoe could understand why things were tough.

At the same time,

‘I still have a long way to go.’

The reason Yoon Jun and Online Headhunter were struggling was due to the departing companies.

And to some extent, the departing companies were influenced by Jungle’s job platform. Given Yoon Jun’s stance, it was natural for Gumanhoe to feel sympathetic.

‘If it were the CEO, it would have been different, right?’

Lee Hyun-woo was also humane.

But he knew how to draw the line.

There was a story from the secretaries about the time he met Billy Kates, where he made sharp comments in front of the IT industry mogul.

They also said that even with Kim Tae-hyun, who was destined to become his brother-in-law, he made sure to secure everything needed.

With such a personality, he might have pressured the opponent at this very moment.

‘I am struggling.’

Even though he knew that Yoon Jun was trying to appear more pitiful, Gumanhoe found it hard to be assertive with a softened heart.

He had no choice but to accept the apology, exchange a few words, and return to the company.

Naturally, he was summoned by Lee Hyun-woo, who was curious about the outcome.

* * *

Lee Hyun-woo looked at Gumanhoe's expression and smiled as he asked,

“Do you feel better?”

“What? Ah, well…”

“……”

“I’m sorry.”

“Huh? Why?”

“Actually, even though you were considerate, I just went and received an apology.”

“Oh… I was wondering what happened. Do you know what I asked you just now?”

“What? Wasn’t it about whether things went well?”

“No. I asked if you felt better.”

“Oh, yes. That… you did.”

Gumanhoe stuttered in embarrassment.

In fact, Lee Hyun-woo was asking about his feelings.

“I knew you wouldn’t be able to be harsh because you’re soft-hearted. The important thing is whether your pent-up frustrations have been relieved.”

“Well… hearing the apology and the bleak future of Online Headhunter did give me a sense of compensation, so…”

“Then that’s good. As expected, you were the right person to go there instead of me.”

Gumanhoe was repeatedly surprised, even opening his eyes wide.

Now he realized that Lee Hyun-woo had already grasped his personality perfectly.

He seemed to have anticipated that Gumanhoe would just accept the apology and not fully vent his frustrations.

Yet he sent him anyway, purely to help Gumanhoe release his pent-up feelings.

“Although it’s not enough, I’ll wrap up the rest by acquiring Online Headhunter.”

“CEO… really…”

Now, his voice even carried a hint of choked-up emotions.

“Why are you so good to me?”

“Good to you? As a CEO, I always want to do my best for my employees, and I’m just putting that into practice.”

The content seemed dry, but seeing Lee Hyun-woo smiling brightly made his heart stir.

‘I can never leave Jungle now.’

Gumanhoe, who had once thought about regaining his company or even becoming independent, abandoned those thoughts at this moment.

* * *

Later that day, Gumanhoe had a drink with Woo Sang-won, who came to his office.

“I heard the news.”

“The rumors travel fast. Hahaha.”

“It’s not just rumors; we’ve all been very interested in what you’ve been doing. No, to be precise, we’ve been interested in the work you’ve been doing, which led to this.”

“What do you mean by my work?”

“You’ve been working so hard. Honestly, I didn’t expect you to handle the talent development department so well.”

“What did I do…”

“You’ve done a lot. Have you heard that Jungle is changing recently? Even in our fast-paced innovative company, there’s a remarkable new energy. When we discussed this among the directors, they mentioned the new employees you recruited. They said they’re really outstanding.”

“Did they? That’s a relief. But why is that thanks to me? Technically, it’s because those new employees are doing well, and if you go deeper, it’s because the heads of each department in Jungle are doing a good job accommodating them. Ultimately, all the credit should go to our CEO.”

In truth, Gumanhoe believed that the reason he worked so hard was thanks to Lee Hyun-woo.

“I heard it again today, but the CEO treats people sincerely. That makes people like me want to give our best. I’m sure the new employees are also influenced by that.”

“You’re right, but you also treat people sincerely. That’s something I lack.”

“No way…”

“It’s true. To be precise, it’s not that I don’t treat people sincerely, but if the other person doesn’t feel it, the effect is halved. The problem is that I can’t intentionally make them feel my sincerity. Knowing that, I visited you today to buy you a drink as an effort.”

“Haha…”

“Anyway, I have to acknowledge the CEO’s sincerity in treating people. So, I think this position suits me perfectly.”

“It’s the same for me. Not everyone can be a CEO. I realized that once again today.”

Woo Sang-won laughed.

He probably felt that his thoughts were the same as his own.

As time passed, Lee Hyun-woo seemed more perfect.

“That’s why I sometimes talk about early retirement, but I feel like I can’t let him go.”

“Me too.”

“Shall we toast to that?”

“Yes, let’s drink deeply and get drunk today. Hahaha.”

Thus, another person was added to those who didn’t want Lee Hyun-woo to retire early.

Meanwhile, Lee Hyun-woo himself was smiling contentedly, watching the growth of key talents.

Is this what they call “different dreams in the same bed”?
