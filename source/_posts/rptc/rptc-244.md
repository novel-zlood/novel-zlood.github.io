The term "fintech" is a portmanteau of finance and technology.

There was no law saying you couldn't do it.

The American simple payment service, Pay Plus, also started in 1998, and in 1999, the eccentric entrepreneur Elon Musk acquired it, giving it wings.

So, in this current view of 1998, there's no reason it can't be done.

However, the problem wasn't the technology, but the finance.

In Korea, it still required system improvements, so Lee Hyun-woo decided to wait for the next opportunity, considering it premature for now.

"But I'll keep knocking on the door consistently."

When bringing future technology forward, regulations should not be a hindrance.

Thinking this way, Lee Hyun-woo finally called one of the newly hired employees to his office.

That person was Hwang Do-hoon, the former head of the Internet Department at 【Daehan Communications】.

"Welcome."

"Yes, CEO."

Should I say, this man has a knife hidden in his smile?

From the first moment he saw him, Lee Hyun-woo couldn't shake the feeling that Hwang Do-hoon was sharply honed.

"Is everything going well at the company?"

"It's a bit uncomfortable."

"In what way..."

"It's just uncomfortable that there's nothing to do."

"Ah, if that's the case, don't worry. The reason I called you today is exactly because of that."

Hwang Do-hoon, who was hired as an experienced professional.

However, for almost a week since joining the company, he had to stay cooped up in his office.

Of course, it was frustrating.

He needed to be given some work to prove his usefulness.

"Could it be that hiring me was a mistake?"

He wondered if the CEO had hired him on an impulse.

Because he noticed that Lee Hyun-woo liked him during the interview.

However, once he was hired, he thought it was because they were worried he wouldn't adapt to 【Jungle】's young atmosphere, so they didn't assign him any tasks.

Hwang Do-hoon is a highly political person.

Such a person is not only excellent at reading the atmosphere but also at revealing themselves in given situations.

Even now.

"But you are calling me 'Team Leader Hwang,' are you suggesting that I will be taking on a team leader role at 【Jungle】?"

He deliberately looked at Lee Hyun-woo with a surprised expression.

Originally, he thought he should at least have that position, but he armed himself with a grateful expression to score points with Lee Hyun-woo.

"Of course. You served as the head of the Internet Department at 【Daehan Communications】, so I believe you can perform more than a team leader role. Ah, by the way, I'd like you to take charge of the External Cooperation Department."

"If it's the External Cooperation Department... there are two places... which one?"

He hadn't just been idle.

In the meantime, he had grasped the company's organization.

In fact, the reason why no work was given to the newly hired employees, both new and experienced, for a week was also to grasp the company.

Of course, most new or experienced employees couldn't delve as deeply and broadly as Hwang Do-hoon.

"Yes, the External Cooperation Department is divided into domestic and overseas. However, for the government and public affairs you mentioned during the interview, I plan to create a new section. The name of the section will be the External Cooperation Department... Institutional Section."

"You named it that to respond to government policies."

"Yes, and if we come up with a better name later, we can change it."

"Ha ha ha, it's perfect. Just perfect."

"For now, I plan to adjust some personnel from the domestic and overseas sections of the External Cooperation Department and send them to that section."

"This is getting a bit burdensome. It seems like I'll be taking on important responsibilities already."

Although he said that, his eyes were gleaming.

It showed his ambition to quickly make his presence known.

Lee Hyun-woo couldn't fail to notice that.

"He didn't claim to be confident in government and public affairs for nothing."

Lee Hyun-woo immediately grasped the identity of Hwang Do-hoon.

He might be different from the overall culture of 【Jungle】.

Most of the employees were young, so there were no factions or internal politics.

That's why it seemed like it would be interesting going forward.

"Our company will have to embrace various types of people."

Being too transparent could be detrimental.

Insisting too much on going straight could easily lead to obstacles.

Sometimes, it's necessary to take a detour, and sometimes, you have to throw a curveball.

This was the reason Lee Hyun-woo hired Hwang Do-hoon and assigned him to the Institutional Section of the External Cooperation Department.

"Looking forward to working with you."

"Oh, CEO, that's what I should be saying... I'm the one looking forward to working with you. Ha ha ha."

Hwang Do-hoon burst into a pleasant laugh.

Watching this, Lee Hyun-woo called for his two chief secretaries.

"Everyone, please greet. This is Hwang Do-hoon, who will be in charge of the External Cooperation Department's Institutional Section."

"Ah, hello."

"Hello."

Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho were familiar with Hwang Do-hoon.

Their task was also to inspect the newly hired experienced and new employees for the past week.

However, since today was the official introduction through the CEO, they greeted him as if meeting for the first time.

"Oh my... I think I'll have to learn a lot from the two of you. Moreover, I've heard that both of you have been managing the External Cooperation Department well."

"No, we didn't do well at that time, and I regret it a lot now."

"Me too. If I get another chance to take charge of the External Cooperation Department, I'm confident I can do better."

When Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho answered seriously in response to the polite words, Hwang Do-hoon felt a bit embarrassed.

"These... they are quite daring because they're young."

Indeed, if you summarize the overall atmosphere of 【Jungle】 in one word, it seemed to be 'passion.'

Seeing them working hard without playing around made his old heart feel warm at times.

While thinking this, he heard Lee Hyun-woo's voice again.

"And Mr. Hwang Do-hoon served as the head of the Internet Department at 【Daehan Communications】. Please respect that and always approach with a learning attitude."

"Yes, we will."

"Yes, we will."

After giving the same answer, the two secretaries looked at Hwang Do-hoon with burdensome eyes.

To this, Hwang Do-hoon laughed again and said.

"Oh, the CEO is praising someone like me too much."

"What do you mean, someone like you? If you served as the head of the Internet Department, you significantly impacted our country's communication infrastructure. Please don't be too humble and teach these two well."

"Yes, I will do my best to learn."

The one who responded immediately was Han Se-jin.

He continued speaking while taking out a notebook and pen from his pocket.

"Please don't hesitate to guide me whenever you have something to say."

It seemed like he was ready to write down everything Hwang Do-hoon said.

Although Kang Dong-ho wasn't that enthusiastic,

"I will engrave it in my heart."

His voice contained a real attitude of learning.

"Oh dear..."

Hwang Do-hoon felt it.

That he might have more to learn about 【Jungle】 than they did.

It seemed that this company had quite a few unique characters.

* * *

The next day, there was a large-scale organizational restructuring meeting.

Naturally, CEO Lee Hyun-woo, COO Woo Sang-won, and the technical director attended, and the two chief secretaries and all the team leaders gathered in the conference room.

"We'll have to expand the conference room soon."

Lee Hyun-woo started with a light-hearted comment to refresh the atmosphere.

At the same time, he introduced the newly appointed team leaders, Hwang Do-hoon and Shin Dong-woon, to the people.

However, it wasn't just two new teams added to the existing six.

"We have also created a new team to add an artistic touch to our website, games, and everything else in the group. The person in charge here is Jang Kang-hyun, the design team leader."

Jang Kang-hyun was also a newly hired experienced professional in this year's recruitment.

Quite a few companies collapsed this year, and Jang Kang-hyun, who led the design department at the recently bankrupt 【Shinhan Construction】, lost his job.

There were many such experienced professionals, most of whom were talented individuals that couldn't be brought in under normal circumstances.

This was why Lee Hyun-woo, who originally didn't plan to hire through open recruitment, changed his mind.

Anyway, after all the introductions, Lee Hyun-woo briefly mentioned that the organization would be gradually reorganized and left the conference room. Then the oldest person, Hwang Do-hoon, started greeting people.

Of course, the current greeting was not the formal one exchanged earlier.

"If time permits, I would like to treat you all to a meal later."

It was an instinctive greeting to show his presence.

But.

"Me!"

Suddenly, Oh Min-woo raised his hand when Hwang Do-hoon mentioned treating them to a meal.

"...?"

"I have the right to be treated by Team Leader Hwang."

This was the first time he received such a reaction.

Although flustered, Hwang Do-hoon asked Oh Min-woo without showing it.

"Oh, Director Oh, ha ha ha, of course, I should treat you. But I'm curious. For what reason do you claim the right..."

"It was my decision that led to our company bringing in Team Leader Hwang."

"...?"

Seeing the question marks in his eyes, Lee Jung-woo and Jang Yoo-chul stepped in.

"Hey, explain it properly."

"Yeah. What is that? I can't understand a word."

"Are you saying Director Oh conducted the document screening for Team Leader Hwang this time?"

Finally, when Woo Sang-won explained in detail, Oh Min-woo immediately nodded.

"Indeed, Director Woo is the best! He understands everything. These guys really have no sense, none! Team Leader Hwang, actually, I selected you during the document screening. Ha ha ha."

He complimented Woo Sang-won, criticized Lee Jung-woo and Jang Yoo-chul, and boasted about his merit to Hwang Do-hoon, ending with a triumphant laugh.

Hwang Do-hoon found it hard to adapt.

"What kind of company... is this like a high school classroom?"

In fact, there were three directors who were university students, so such an evaluation was understandable.

Of course, Hwang Do-hoon thought so internally, but outwardly he smiled like a good person.

Then Oh Min-woo took it a step further.

"Since we're on the topic, how about having a welcome party for the new team leaders tonight?"

"Sounds good."

"I agree."

Immediately, two directors joined in.

In such situations, quiet people usually follow the majority.

"It's been a while since we had a company dinner. Sounds good."

"Indeed, we haven't gathered together like this often, have we?"

"Then I'll suggest it to the CEO."

Finally, Woo Sang-won stepped in.

But.

"Uh... I'm sorry, but I can't drink, so it will be hard for me to attend."

The new design department head, Jang Kang-hyun, failed to read the room.

Hwang Do-hoon was again dumbfounded.

"I mean, you could make an excuse to avoid it, but why say you can't drink? Moreover, if you're newly working at 【Jungle】, you should be eager to attend such gatherings to adapt quickly."

Usually, even if a company goes bankrupt, some people stay until the end.

But it was clear to Hwang Do-hoon that Jang Kang-hyun was kicked out of 【Shinhan Construction】.

He seemed to lack social skills.

The interesting thing was that no one tried to stop him from not attending.

No one even showed an expression of regret.

From this, one could tell that the company didn't have a culture of forcing social gatherings.

Instead.

"Ah, Team Leader Jang, I'll visit you later. I think I might need your help with character design for the game I'm making."

When the CEO's brother, who seemed to be a powerful figure, requested, Jang Kang-hyun nodded.

Then he said.

"If it's a discussion related to design, it's always welcome. By the way, I happened to see the production of a Go game this week, and the design was too simple. If you release it as is, I think the reaction won't be good."

Such directness?

Hwang Do-hoon realized that he might never get close to Jang Kang-hyun.

"Anyway, there are too many unique characters here... phew..."
