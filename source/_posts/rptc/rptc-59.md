As always, if you told her to do something, Secretary Park Min-sook would get it done.

So it didn't take her a few days to find out about ADSL.

"It wasn't just at the review stage; all the preparations were already in place."

"What? Is that really true?"

"Yes, that's correct. However, due to opposition from 【Daehan Communications】, it hasn't been implemented yet. But recently, public opinion has been shifting, and there have been a couple of articles in the media, so it seems they're keeping an eye on things."

Kim Ah-young's fine eyebrows furrowed.

Lee Hyun-woo was right about this.

To be precise, Lee Hyun-woo, who supported Nostradamus's predictions, was right.

Before she knew it, Kim Ah-young found herself deeply agreeing with this logic and thought she couldn't just sit still.

"Then the media should expose it more. Isn't it the media's job to gather public opinion and reveal the truth? Or am I wrong?"

"Well…."

It's undoubtedly true, but does the media only reveal the truth?

Not really.

Especially in our country, a few media companies monopolize information and only reveal the truths they want to.

Sometimes they exaggerate and distort it.

However, since the media is above the structure, they can adjust any information to their liking.

The problem was that a trivial person like Park Min-sook couldn't do that.

"I guess I need to meet my uncle."

"Director, what are you planning to do?"

"I told you, didn't I? The internet is a public good, and the people should benefit from it. It's not right for a public enterprise to block it with money we paid from our taxes."

Park Min-sook was at a loss.

'Miss always does what she says she'll do.'

Her uncle would probably just let her handle it because he's annoyed.

If that happens, Kim Ah-young might actually end up meeting the editor-in-chief of 【Sejong Daily】.

Would this look good?

Park Min-sook, thinking this wasn't right, quickly intervened.

"Then I'll meet the editor-in-chief of 【Sejong Daily】 first."

"Secretary Park?"

"Yes, I'll go and convey your intentions. Instead, how about we don't interfere with whether they publish the article or not?"

"We'll see about that when the time comes."

"Phew."

Park Min-sook sighed.

Originally, taming the media was one of the important tasks of the organization.

Of course, the public doesn't know this well.

But when it becomes known someday, someone will definitely need to take responsibility.

'I can't help it. I have to take that responsibility.'

Isn't the position of chief secretary one where you can't go against your superior's will?

Also, if you think about it, Kim Ah-young's argument is right.

It's a public good, and blocking it by 【Daehan Communications】 is clearly wrong.

Thinking that she should rationalize it this way to properly speak to 【Sejong Daily】, Park Min-sook steeled her heart.

Blocking IP tracking ultimately means enhancing security.

Considering that security will be very important in the future, Lee Hyun-woo thought that designing defenses at this point wasn't a bad idea.

'If only the speed could be faster, I wouldn't have any regrets. Security is in place, but should I provoke them with Nostradamus once more?'

Thinking this inwardly, he shook his head.

He decided to give it a little more time.

'Everything needs time to mature.'

Fortunately, since it was heating up mainly in 【Jungle】's cafe, he thought that someday the newspapers might cover it.

More than that, the now cramped office space caught his eye.

Currently, 【Jungle】 was hiring people frequently, and each time computers and telephones increased.

Even though he had expanded the space considering this, it seemed that soon it would be insufficient, making him realize once again that the company's growth was at a rapid pace.

'Since money keeps coming into the account, should I dramatically expand the space?'

By dramatic, he meant using an entire building.

So Lee Hyun-woo went out to visit a real estate agency.

The real estate agent, with a look that said 'expanding again?', expressed surprise but didn't mention it, instead taking Lee Hyun-woo to a newly constructed building nearby.

"It's a 7-story building."

"The owner suddenly needs money, so it's up for sale."

"Then we can buy it cheaply."

"Why do young people always think about haggling?"

"Where is there no room for negotiation? Instead, I trust and leave it all to you."

"Huh…."

The real estate agent's mouth dropped open because it was true.

In the past two times, even though he asked for a discount, when it came to the deal, he trusted and didn't interfere.

In other words, he meant to do the same this time.

At the same time.

"Mister, it's already the third time this year. Isn't that quite something? And think about how many more times we'll need new buildings in the future. The company is doing well, so we keep expanding like this. Isn't that right?"

With these words, there was no room for argument.

Honestly, from the real estate agent's perspective, Lee Hyun-woo was already an amazing client and seemed likely to become an even more tremendous potential customer in the future.

Naturally, the next words came out.

"Of course. Alright, I'll try to get the best discount."

"Thank you in advance. Oh, when will it be completed?"

"As you can see, completion... is not far off, and we just need to do the interior work."

"Then I should start looking into it soon."

This meant he had decided on this building.

As Lee Hyun-woo turned away, he was already visualizing what to put in the building.

'Should I make a nightclub in the basement?'

Suddenly, he thought of Oh Min-woo, who loves nightclubs.

He thought it would be his favorite.

And as his thoughts drifted to that guy, Lee Hyun-woo felt it was time to take action.

'I need to recruit Oh Min-woo.'

He was the one who built the defense to block IP tracking.

So it was certain that he was an incredible genius, just as his younger brother had said.

Even if not, he was a talent sought after by 【Single】 and 【Yaho】 in his past life.

He had thrived in those places, so his growth potential was probably still enormous.

* * *

Meanwhile, Park Min-sook handled her work swiftly and efficiently.

Before Kim Ah-young could step in, she hurriedly targeted various media outlets, and as a result, 【Sejong Daily】 soon came out with a decent headline.

『【Daehan Communications】, blocking ADSL to monopolize internet service?』

This was a significantly aggressive tone compared to previous news, with the content being wielded by a journalist after direct investigation.

Next, the top-selling economic newspaper followed with a headline.

『【Daehan Power】, actually prepared ADSL!』

With two major newspapers leading the way, other papers began reporting competitively.

『【Daehan Power】 claims ADSL service is always possible!』

『【Daehan Communications】 denies blocking ADSL』

『Can internet service be possible through an amicable agreement between 【Daehan Power】 and 【Daehan Communications】?』

『Ministry of Information and Communication: The people have the right to better services』

『Stock market today: Telecommunications-related stocks surge!』

『【Daehan Power】 to provide ADSL service?』

These were the articles that came out over the past few days.

Seeing Kim Ah-young enjoying the various headlines, a smile appeared on Park Min-sook's lips as well.

'She's definitely not someone who should be confined to just the 【Seorabeol Hotel】.'

The excuse was strange, but if internet service improved through fair competition, it would be a significant achievement by itself.

Thinking that Kim Ah-young's capabilities, which she had seen since childhood, were once again proven, Park Min-sook felt a sense of pride.

* * *

Finally, a few days later, when 【Daehan Power】 announced that they would establish ADSL service, Lee Hyun-woo cheered inwardly.

"It's done, it's done!"

If 【Daehan Power】 uses the power towers and transmission lines, it will be really quick.

However, due to opposition from 【Daehan Communications】, it couldn't be done in his previous life.

In the end, they selected a subcontractor and laid the lines, a process that took over a year.

It was only in 1998 that the service started properly.

Feeling good, he went into the lab and said,

"We might be able to start a trial service within the year."

"Hyung, are you that happy?"

The unexpected response came from Oh Min-woo.

"Why are you here again today?"

"I don't have a clear place to go."

"But you're not even our employee."

"Don't worry. I'll keep the security intact. Or should I start working part-time here?"

"Not right now."

"......!"

Oh Min-woo's pupils shook.

Honestly, he thought Lee Hyun-woo would accept with a delighted face if he said he would do it.

"Then when?"

"I have no choice but to say not right now."

"You're kicking away a golden opportunity."

"That's right. If you can't understand what I'm saying, unfortunately, I have no choice but to kick it away."

Lee Hyun-woo calmly responded to his words and turned around.

The others in the lab, who were listening to the conversation between the two with interest, were very disappointed when Lee Hyun-woo was about to leave.

On the other hand, Oh Min-woo, feeling slightly hurt in his pride, followed him outside and asked,

"Why? I really have the skills. I can do anything right away."

"I know that too."

"Then?"

"I found a problem different from your skills."

"Is it that I'm not diligent?"

"Instead of diligence, you have passion."

"Then there's no reason I can't do it."

"Having both skills and passion is an even bigger problem. If you come to our company, the development team will be reorganized around you in no time. Can you take responsibility for that?"

"......."

For a moment, Oh Min-woo couldn't open his mouth.

From Lee Hyun-woo's words, he finally understood what problem he saw.

It was responsibility.

But his heart slightly raced.

'Reorganize the development team around me?'

One thing was certain: Lee Hyun-woo recognized him.

He was evaluating him very highly.

"What if I'm ready to take responsibility?"

"Then follow me."

"What?"

"Let's talk outside."

As always, Lee Hyun-woo's voice had a sense of leisure.

Drawn by this, Oh Min-woo went outside.

Before long, standing in front of a nearly completed building under construction, he asked,

"Why here?"

"This building has 7 floors. I'm planning to lease it."

"Wow, hyung, you're really rich."

"Yeah, I'm rich. I make a lot of money. I can buy this building with the money I earned in a month."

"Then why don't you buy it?"

"Because it will soon be annoying to sell it again."

"That means the company will grow even more?"

"That's right. We moved after just a few months since starting the business, and even after moving, we kept expanding the office by leasing empty spaces as warehouses and labs."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"You mentioned earlier that you had the resolve to take responsibility. If that's sincere, I can entrust one floor of this building to you."

"Really? You're going to entrust a floor to me?"

"Yes, I can. But the completion is at the end of this year. That's why I said not right now earlier."

Looking back, he did say not right now in the lab earlier.

At that time, he thought it was a euphemistic way of declining.

But it literally meant not right now...

'I wasn't originally this kind of person, but I keep getting drawn to this hyung.'

Suddenly, Oh Min-woo felt his heart swell.
