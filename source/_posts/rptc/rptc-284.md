After going through the final interviews, Jungle recruited high-quality new and experienced employees with more meticulous scoring than ever before.

"It feels like the company is becoming more systematic."

"Indeed. It feels more organized compared to before."

"That's true, but until recently, it felt like the CEO was doing everything alone. Now, it seems like we've managed to lighten his load a bit, and that makes me feel good."

The three people having this conversation were, of course, Lee Jung-woo, Oh Min-woo, and Jang Yoo-chul.

As founding members of Jungle, these three young core members frequently gathered to exchange their thoughts.

Today's first topic was this year's first open recruitment for new employees, which naturally led to discussions related to their own work.

"By the way, when the new employees come in, I'm thinking of creating another social media platform."

"This guy never stops. Why do you keep making things? Just focus on one thing, like I do with MP3s, okay? Right, Jung-woo?"

"Yeah, it's true that doing just one thing can get boring."

"Exactly. So, I'm curious. Yoo-chul, don't you ever get tired of it?"

"Well, I'm not a genius like you guys, so even doing one thing is tough. Besides, I find it more fun to create copy protections or modify MP3 files."

"But you're going to do it, right?"

"Yes, Yoo-chul, you should do it."

"Well... if I have time..."

Here, "it" referred to collaborating on the open source programming language that Jungle had prepared.

After the homepage went live, numerous developers from home and abroad joined in, accelerating the evolution of the programming language at a rapid pace.

As a result, Woo Sang-won, thinking it was now possible to create programming tools with this language, requested their cooperation.

In fact, new things are often created by freely combining existing ones.

A great developer is not someone who creates something out of nothing but someone who combines known elements to create something original.

They were no different.

They started to systematize the language from the open source and create programming tools that felt new.

In fact, the very first source of the open source was also a version of Linux modified by Woo Sang-won and a few developers to fit Jungle's format.

It wasn't completely unfamiliar territory.

Hence, when applied to Jungle, it fit very well.

The first organized programming tool that emerged was called "foot."

Woo Sang-won named it.

It signified taking the first step, so instead of a complex compound word, he simply used "foot."

He immediately reported this to Lee Hyun-woo.

"Now, I will make it public so that various software can be developed based on this."

No matter how much Lee Hyun-woo had been studying IT recently, there was no way to learn everything in a short time.

Sometimes, knowledge is power, but ignorance is bliss.

"Yes, go ahead."

He thought it was better to entrust Woo Sang-won with deeply technical matters based on trust.

However, it wasn't that he was completely hands-off. When he got home, he asked his younger brother, Lee Jung-woo.

"It means that now, with the tools we've created, various developers can make software."

"Oh, that's nice. Does this mean the platform for the programming language has started?"

"That's already started. Now, it means we're preparing a platform for software."

"Oh, so all developers can upload their software to the platform we provide?"

"Yes, that's right."

"To download for free?"

"There will be both free and paid options."

"Oh? If it can be sold for money, then there will be a commission?"

"Exactly. That's what Director Woo is pushing for."

Lee Hyun-woo's eyes shook vigorously.

By chance, a downloadable web software distribution network was created.

Lee Hyun-woo thought that it could later evolve into an app software distribution network.

'Once the direction is set, it evolves on its own.'

He still didn't know.

That he himself was the one who processed the raw materials into something like a jewel.

Even geniuses, or prodigies who are not quite geniuses but still exceptionally talented, can fully display their talents under the master craftsman, Lee Hyun-woo.

In Woo Sang-won's case, while conversing with Lee Hyun-woo, he naturally came up with the idea of a software distribution network.

The more surprising part was the big leap he reported a few days later.

"You asked me to create an e-book reader, so I looked into outsourcing companies. Internally, we've also started working on software content for the e-book reader. If we proceed simultaneously, both the device and the application should be ready on time."

"Application... you mean apps, right?"

"Apps? Oh, yes, if you abbreviate it, it's 'apps.'"

"Haha..."

To be able to say the word "apps" in 1998.

'Isn't this too fast?'

He wondered if it was okay.

Still, knowing that apps would be essential if heading towards smartphones, he welcomed it greatly in his heart.

Although Woo Sang-won might be better with technology, Lee Hyun-woo, who had practically experienced the future, could better integrate anything into the business.

"Then we'll need a name for the software distribution network. A platform for downloading software, whether web or app, unified in the future."

"That... I suppose so?"

"Let's call it a store."

"What? A store? How about Jungle Store?"

"A store... not bad. Alright, let's go with that."

That was the moment Jungle Store was born.

* * *

By rapidly advancing technology, Lee Hyun-woo also addressed corporate culture and employee welfare equally quickly.

Moreover, Jungle, being a young company, could be said to grow on an unstable foundation.

Although it attracted people with its innovative image, that could also make them feel uneasy.

"We've been running a gym to improve employee fitness, and now we'll implement a health keeper system in addition."

"Huh... a health keeper?"

"What... what is that?"

"It's a system where we invite people with a national certification in massage therapy to relieve the fatigue and work stress of our employees."

"Hmm..."

In other words, it meant bringing in massage therapists into the company.

It was an expanded executive meeting with department heads present.

To those who looked baffled, Lee Hyun-woo calmly explained the purpose.

"Do you know what the chronic diseases of office workers are? It's musculoskeletal disorders. Especially in our company, where employees sit in front of PCs for long hours, there can be strain on the shoulders and back. That's why I encouraged the use of the gym, but it didn't reach my standards. Therefore, to ensure the prevention and healing of musculoskeletal disorders, I've decided to implement this, so please follow along as much as possible."

"Yes, CEO..."

"Understood..."

Thus, Jungle became the first company to recruit massage therapists with national certification.

Some were hired as regular employees, and some were secured through outsourcing companies.

Finally, the day came when the many massage therapists they had recruited showed their worth.

"From now on, we will commence the 1st Jungle Sports Day!"

Earlier, through an email, Lee Hyun-woo had announced a spring sports day.

Today, the day of the warm spring, was that day.

With over a thousand employees, they needed a spacious venue. They contacted the district office in advance and managed to rent a sizable stadium and sports facilities.

Most employees' expressions were positive.

Although Jungle had an overwhelmingly high ratio of men, and not everyone liked sports, they enjoyed getting away from work for a day of group exercise.

Moreover, the event was well-organized by a professional event company.

"One, two! One, two!"

The tug-of-war was won by the portal site team,

"Run! Faster!"

The 100m race was won by the cloud team, which had a standout sprinter,

"Hang in there! Just a bit more!"

The marathon was won by an employee from the content team, nicknamed the Ironman.

With scores being tallied across various events, the final victory went to the portal site team.

"For those who will suffer from muscle pain after exerting themselves today, don't worry. Health keepers will be around tomorrow, so just relax and let them take care of you."

Employees tilted their heads at Lee Hyun-woo's words during the closing ceremony.

The term "health keeper" was unfamiliar, and being told to entrust their bodies to them?

Their questions were answered the next day.

In the office workspace, health keepers, i.e., nationally certified massage therapists, roamed around and massaged employees' shoulders.

There was no need for a special posture.

One could just sit and let them work.

However,

"Those with muscle pain in the lower back or other areas, or who always feel stiff, there is a health care room. If you come by any time, we will take good care of you. By the way, the service is free, you know?"

Employees' eyes widened.

They were pleased.

Just having their shoulders massaged made a noticeable difference, and now they could get massages for their lower back and other areas?

"Wow, isn't our company awesome?"

"It's no joke. It feels like getting a job at a dream company."

"No wonder everyone wants to get in here."

"I heard the turnover rate is almost zero."

It was amusing to talk about turnover rates for a three-year-old company.

But it was true that almost no one left.

That's why Jungle also had minimal disruptions due to workforce gaps.

Typically, resignations occur due to issues like job dissatisfaction or lack of benefits.

Recently, Jungle's average salary also approached the highest level in the industry and the country.

It meant it was impossible to find a company with better pay.

Naturally, Lee Hyun-woo could only be satisfied with this outcome.

It might seem like excessive spending on salaries and benefits, but in reality, he knew that retaining employees was more important due to the enormous costs of re-training new hires.

"Training costs per person at large companies exceed 100 million won."

With the total training costs for new university graduates in Korea amounting to trillions of won, the point was made.

Ultimately, alleviating stress and supporting a good work environment leads to better performance.

"And since they're already performing well, I can only give more to the employees."

Because of Lee Hyun-woo's mindset, employee productivity began to soar.

Growth, welfare, and more growth.

It seemed the term "virtuous cycle" was accurately applied here.
