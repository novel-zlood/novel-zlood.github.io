That evening.

Han Se-jin met Kang Dong-ho at a pub.

“Wow, it's been a hectic day.”

“How's the handover going?”

“Couldn't even start. I've been busy sorting out people.”

“Yeah, same here.”

Both had to rack their brains to appoint a team leader to take over their positions.

Lee Hyun-woo had said that positions shape people, but when it came to promoting someone to a team leader, there were many factors to consider.

Nonetheless, they finally decided on their successors, and the handover was to start the next day.

“A lot will change after Chuseok.”

“After Chuseok?”

“Yes, the secretariat will be expanded and reorganized then.”

“No, it starts during Chuseok.”

“What?”

“I heard that a secretary's duty includes managing their superior's personal life. The new team leaders will take over after Chuseok, but we will have to follow the CEO's Chuseok schedule.”

Han Se-jin's eyes trembled slightly at Kang Dong-ho's words.

Thinking about it, he was right.

Last year, Lee Hyun-woo spent the holidays quietly with his family, but this year's Lunar New Year was different.

Several media outlets had taken photos of 'Lee Hyun-woo's Lunar New Year' and published them.

It was inevitable since Lee Hyun-woo was considered the top groom-to-be during holidays.

“Yeah, this Chuseok, even more journalists will be lurking around the CEO's house.”

“Exactly. The CEO is practically a public figure. He leads the most talked-about company in Korea and recently announced that he's dating the eldest daughter of the country's top conglomerate family.”

“So, we have to spend this Chuseok with the CEO.”

“Of course.”

“Will the CEO allow it?”

“A secretary's duty is to handle everything 'on their own.'”

“Ah...”

Han Se-jin realized many things while talking with Kang Dong-ho.

He was right.

Why else would Lee Hyun-woo assign them as chief secretaries?

It meant they had to prepare everything 'on their own.'

“There are many things we have to do even if the CEO doesn't want us to. And we have to push through even if we get scolded.”

As expected, Kang Dong-ho was direct.

In response, Han Se-jin brought out his own strength.

He opened his notebook and said to Kang Dong-ho,

“I heard something from Secretary Yoo earlier that might be useful.”

“What is it?”

“It’s confirmed that the CEO will visit the chairman of Guseong Group this Chuseok.”

“What?”

Kang Dong-ho's eyes widened, as if asking how he knew.

Han Se-jin quickly answered.

“The CEO mentioned various gifts for employees this Chuseok, and mentioned some special ones. He said there were many people to visit. When Secretary Yoo asked where he was going, he replied that he was invited to his girlfriend's house.”

“Ah...”

“So, tomorrow we need to confirm if Kim Ah-young will be visiting the CEO's house this Chuseok.”

“Of course, she will visit to pay her respects!”

Kang Dong-ho interrupted Han Se-jin to emphasize his opinion.

“Couples don't always visit both families during holidays, but it's rare for only one side to visit.”

“True, right?”

“Then the journalists will take tons of photos again.”

“Well, the Guseong Group's security will make close-up photos difficult.”

“Speaking of security, we can't continue like this, can we?”

“I thought so too. Do you have any ideas?”

“I’m planning to visit Secretary Park Min-sook tomorrow.”

“Ah, you’re planning to look for security guards through that route.”

“Exactly. And while I'm at it, I should also look for a driver.”

“The CEO dating Kim Ah-young has its advantages here.”

Guseong Group's security personnel and chauffeurs wouldn't just be anyone.

Using those connections would be more than adequate, so asking Park Min-sook would make things easier.

“By the way, could you occasionally copy some of what you write down for me? I've tried to learn a few times, but it didn't work out. I'm sorry for trying to take the easy way.”

“No problem. I'll do that. In return, you’ll share any connections or information you gather with me, right?”

“Of course. The coordination between us will be the driving force to properly serve our CEO.”

“To serve him better, we need to know about development, given our company is an info-tech firm.”

“That’s why we included some development personnel in the secretariat today.”

“As expected...”

Lee Hyun-woo had tasked them with filling the secretariat before Chuseok.

Han Se-jin was the first chief secretary, and Kang Dong-ho was the second chief secretary.

“I also included one development personnel. But now that we’re talking, we might need to divide the tasks between the two secretariats.”

As they talked, they endlessly discussed things to do.

Though inexperienced, they were determined to assist Lee Hyun-woo in all aspects, from personal life to development.

Of course, when Chuseok started a few days later, Lee Hyun-woo was taken aback to see the two of them at his house.

* * *

“What are you doing here on the first day of the holidays?”

Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho's faces showed deep determination.

It seemed they were resolved to stay firm despite any scolding or nagging from Lee Hyun-woo.

“We’re starting our duties as chief secretaries.”

“Yes, from today, we’ll do our best to serve you.”

“Haha...”

Lee Hyun-woo laughed in disbelief.

He understood that the work of the secretariat would inevitably encroach on their personal lives.

The duties of a group head’s secretariat had to cover personal aspects beyond the official ones.

‘I said after Chuseok to avoid this.’

Since he hadn't emphasized it, the side effects emerged immediately.

At that moment,

“Don't just stand there, come in and have a meal.”

Lee Hyun-woo's mother, Jo Young-sook, suddenly appeared and invited them inside.

“No, we're fine.”

“We'll wait here.”

“What are you waiting for? Come in or leave, choose one.”

Lee Hyun-woo, signaling his resignation, gave them the choice.

Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho exchanged glances.

‘We need to know the CEO’s family well.’

‘Right. Let’s take a step closer today.’

Lee Hyun-woo could read their silent conspiracy from their eyes.

But he had no choice but to let it go.

He couldn't define the scope of a chief secretary's duties.

Just like new wine is put into new wineskins, the company Lee Hyun-woo envisioned, Jungle, would have various positions and duties.

The recently agreed-upon telecommuting with Woo Sang-won was the same.

Naturally, the secretariat’s setup would be left to them.

‘Besides, I don't think they’d listen even if I tried to stop them.’

From earlier, he felt their eyes were determined.

It meant his scolding and warnings wouldn’t work well.

‘I should just think about how to give them some rest days.’

That’s why he had launched the first and second secretariats simultaneously.

Whether they knew it or not, during the meal, Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho started asking the family various questions.

“Are any relatives visiting today, the first day of the holidays?”

“They’ll come from tomorrow. But what should we call you two?”

“Oh, I didn’t properly introduce myself. Though we’ve met a few times, I’ll formally introduce myself. I’m Han Se-jin, in charge of the first secretariat.”

“I’m Kang Dong-ho, in charge of the second secretariat.”

“So, you’re the chiefs?”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

Lee Hyun-woo couldn’t help but smile.

It was like having two new recruits in the army.

“Do you two have to take care of my son’s work even during the holidays?”

“Of course. We operate with a mindset of 365 days, 24 hours...”

“Not 24 hours.”

Lee Hyun-woo quickly interjected at Kang Dong-ho’s overstatement.

Then Han Se-jin immediately picked up.

“Then we’ll work with the mindset of arriving before the CEO and leaving after him.”

“Ugh...”

“Ugh...”

Lee Hyun-woo and Lee Jung-woo both shook their heads.

Then Lee Jung-woo spoke.

“You two will be having meals at our house often, won’t you?”

“Huh? Oh, um…we’ll eat before coming next time.”

“That’s not what I meant. It just feels like that. You might even have songpyeon tomorrow.”

“No, we’re fine.”

“My mother won’t be fine with that. Last year, our house was practically Jungle’s office. At the very least, she never let anyone working with us go hungry.”

Lee Jung-woo was right.

They had started almost penniless, and friends who came to help ate meals prepared by his mother while working.

It felt like just yesterday, but it had been a year and a half.

Suddenly, that day felt nostalgic.

‘Time really flies. And so does our company’s growth.’

Jungle had grown enough to have two chief secretaries.

At this point, Lee Jung-woo glanced at his brother.

He, too, seemed to be silently reminiscing.

* * *

Whether to stay or leave, the compromise between Lee Hyun-woo and the two chief secretaries ended by evening.

After they left, his mother asked,

“Will they come tomorrow too?”

“I told them not to, but I don't think it’ll help.”

“I’m worried they’ll lose their personal lives.”

“Indeed. Even if they come, I hope they visit the ancestral graves first...”

Lee Hyun-woo trailed off.

He felt they would come from the morning.

‘Rotating shifts in the secretariat are essential.’

Lee Hyun-woo had worked in the secretary’s office at Duksung Group.

Even a workaholic like him felt his body wear out after a few years.

Rotating shifts were necessary.

Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho would probably have to move to another position after 2 or 3 years.

Until then, they were bound to endure hardships.

Knowing it was futile to stop them, it felt like the same struggle would continue.

‘Can’t be helped.’

How wonderful would it be if everything went as Lee Hyun-woo wished?

As the group expanded, someone had to sacrifice, and someone had to compromise.

Remembering that and compensating for it was the head’s duty.

Lee Hyun-woo felt his shoulders getting heavier.

Especially since he dreamed of going public, Jungle’s operations would inevitably differ from before.

The head was responsible for everything.

Was it just heavy?

No, it was also exciting.

It felt like the organization was finally taking shape.

‘I should seriously start building a proper headquarters.’

He recalled the dream he had discussed with Kim Ah-young.

Declaring to create ‘Jungle World’ in Jeju Island.

It was time to take a step forward from the starting line.
