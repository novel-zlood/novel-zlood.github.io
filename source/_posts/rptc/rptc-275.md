In reality, through the data center, 【Jungle】 and 【Guseong Electronics】 have developed a symbiotic relationship, much like a crocodile and a plover bird.

When 【Guseong Electronics】 built the mainframe server for the data center, they needed to know how much 【Jungle】 would utilize it. Consequently, people from the top executives to the lower ranks frequently met to coordinate various details, big and small.

Naturally, a masterpiece was on the verge of being born.

But it seemed like that was not the end.

“There’s a place we need to stop by before going to the bar.”

“Where to?”

“You'll see when we get there. It’s a place you need to see because it’s related to something started because of you.”

The curiosity-inducing statement triggered a search engine in Lee Hyun-woo’s mind.

‘What could it be?’

Something that started because of him?

There were too many possibilities, making it hard to pinpoint.

However, as they passed Suwon and approached Hwaseong, something came to mind.

Precisely, looking at the mold companies lined up, he could understand why Kim Tae-hyun had brought him here.

“A 3D printer!”

“Just figured it out?”

The place Kim Tae-hyun personally drove to with Lee Hyun-woo was 【X-Cycle】, a company dreaming of the era of 3D printers.

Originally, Lee Hyun-woo had intended to invest in this company.

However, at the investment fair hosted by the 21st Century Venture Association, Kim Tae-hyun had made a bold choice, and since then, there had been no news.

“Do you remember what you said back then? That commercial 3D printing technology, rather than industrial, would spread widely in the future.”

“Yes, I did.”

“But since there’s no sign of that happening yet, the president here is very frustrated.”

“I see.”

“Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying you should take responsibility, but since we’re here, maybe you could say something encouraging to the president…”

Lee Hyun-woo felt unexpectedly good, seeing this human side of Kim Tae-hyun.

‘Well, I should have experienced this in my past life.’

In his previous life, there was a flood of articles that were not neutrally written.

They either bashed Kim Tae-hyun extremely or praised him excessively.

Especially due to advertisements, many articles claimed to be his bodyguards, so Lee Hyun-woo had a bias.

He thought Kim Tae-hyun viewed humans as mere parts of an organization.

‘That might have been possible in the past life.’

Looking back, it was as if everything around Lee Hyun-woo had been reset.

Even though he didn’t know what kind of person Kim Tae-hyun was in the past life, he was certainly getting a different feeling this time around.

At least, seeing him approach with a sense of responsibility towards the places he invested in, Lee Hyun-woo could only respond this way.

“Of course. I’ll talk to him.”

Finally arriving at 【X-Cycle】, the president was already waiting at the entrance.

Lee Hyun-woo remembered his name.

‘Yang Sung-min.’

Naturally, he extended his hand as soon as he got out of the car.

“Hello, President Yang.”

“Oh, hello, President Lee. Director Kim is here too.”

It seemed he already knew they were coming.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been waiting at the entrance like this.

“We came to look around with Director Kim.”

“You’re always welcome to visit. I’ll show you around right away.”

Yang Sung-min then led the two to the lab.

As they moved, he said the following:

“We are currently constructing a factory with investment from 【Guseong Electronics】. I’m slightly worried about whether the products we produce there will sell…”

“Of course, they have to sell. Don’t worry too much. I’m very good at selling things.”

“Hahaha, just hearing that makes my heart race.”

Having an encouraging conversation, they entered the lab, where a 3D printer immediately caught their eyes.

It was certainly larger than what Lee Hyun-woo had seen in his past life.

It looked over 1 meter tall, making it difficult to imagine individuals bringing it into their homes instead of companies.

Still, without showing any sign of it, Lee Hyun-woo walked towards the 3D printer as Yang Sung-min began to explain.

“You might already know, but just to explain 3D printing technology briefly… It looks similar to molding, but the production method is completely different.”

“Yes, while molding involves cutting materials, 3D printing technology builds layer by layer. So, there’s no waste.”

“Correct. Recently, there’s been a lot of talk about the environment, right? Personally, I think that if commercial 3D printing technology gets more integrated, it could be the optimal machine for eco-friendly methods. By the way, materials can include not just plastic but also biochemical substances.”

At this point, Kim Tae-hyun stepped in.

“Our company has already instructed a report on utilizing 3D printing technology. But after talking with President Yang, it seems that entering research now would take several years.”

“That’s understandable. For companies, changing the production method itself is a big gamble. How about toy companies instead?”

“Hmm? I hadn’t thought of that.”

“Neither did I, haha…”

In fact, applying 3D printing technology to the production of toys for children wasn’t difficult.

The reason they hadn’t thought of it quickly might be because they hadn’t experienced the future like Lee Hyun-woo.

“Then why not look into toy companies? Especially with 3D printing technology, you can produce small quantities of many varieties, allowing you to create various characters from regular animated movies.”

“Yes, yes, it feels like we’ve found the answer right away.”

Although he felt good, Lee Hyun-woo, thinking it was still far from over, started to recite further.

“Selling a few products to domestic toy companies would be the end. You need to expand the market and look overseas. Especially, the toy markets in the U.S. and Japan are large. Besides toys, there’s also a figure market in Japan.”

“Th... That’s right…”

“What does it mean that there’s a figure market? It means there are many people who like figures. Naturally, selling personal 3D printers to them would be possible. However, considering this one is over 1 meter, it would sell better if you made it smaller.”

Yang Sung-min's eyes shook rapidly as he looked at Kim Tae-hyun.

Kim Tae-hyun, also surprised by the unforeseen suggestion, let out an exclamation.

“Indeed…”

Then, turning back to Yang Sung-min, he said:

“President Yang, I think we can penetrate the U.S. and Japanese markets through the 【Guseong】 branches there.”

“Yes, and since both places have 【Jungle Shopping】, we can try selling online too.”

“Just hearing that is exciting.”

With such strong support from behind, it was no surprise that Yang Sung-min’s face quickly lit up with excitement.

Lee Hyun-woo then added:

“Incidentally, we might need to train some 3D printing experts. Having the machines but not knowing how to use them would be a problem.”

“Of course. We are trying to make it as accessible as possible to the general public. Honestly, this current model is for experts, which is why we debated a lot about whether to market it. We’ve also finished developing a smaller, more user-friendly model.”

“That’s great. Then you can diversify the applications. Release the over 1-meter 3D printer for small toy companies or expert use and market the smaller one for the general public. By the way, if you plan to release it for expert use, you’ll need many people who can handle it. How about venturing into the education sector?”

“Education sector? How…”

“It’s simple. Train personnel to teach 3D printing, essentially cultivating professional instructors.”

“…….”

Seeing that Yang Sung-min still didn’t fully understand, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and elaborated.

“All your employees here can handle 3D printers well, right? Send some of those employees to the academy run by the 21st Century Venture Association.”

“Oh… okay…”

“The academy recently started close discussions with the government. The key point is that the government will cover the tuition fees to ensure reasonable compensation for the instructors. Initially, the 21st Century Venture Association offered free training, but as the number of trainees grew, expenses increased. If the government covers it, more trainees can be taught. What do you think will happen to those trainees?”

Although it was a bit of a distant issue, it was important, so Yang Sung-min swallowed hard and responded.

“Having acquired 3D printing skills, they can enter related industries.”

“Exactly. Some might even become instructors. As you know, for an industry to rise, there need to be many people who can handle it. As more people become adept with 3D printers, the market will naturally grow.”

This was something Lee Hyun-woo had experienced in his past life.

To grow the market, the first area to approach was education.

So, mentioning the education sector wasn’t about short-term results but to encourage long-term vision and preparation for the future.

“Isn’t it fortunate? That the 21st Century Venture Association, where President Yang is involved, started free education.”

“Yes, thinking about it, it is fortunate. I’ll contact the chairman tomorrow.”

Lee Hyun-woo nodded.

‘Still, wouldn’t it be better if I subtly contacted them first?’

After leaving 【X-Cycle】 and getting into Kim Tae-hyun’s car, Lee Hyun-woo took out his phone and contacted Jung Sung-woo, the chairman of the 21st Century Venture Association.

(Hello?)

“Hello? Ah, Chairman, it’s me, Lee Hyun-woo.”

(Oh, it’s been a while.)

“Yes, how have you been?”

(Of course, and you, President Lee?)

After exchanging pleasantries, Lee Hyun-woo got to the point.

“I’m calling because I was hoping we could add a new course at our academy.”

(A new course?)

“Yes, 3D printing technology.”

Lee Hyun-woo briefly explained what had happened earlier.

Jung Sung-woo quickly gave the okay and said:

(Actually, the government informed us today that they would cover 100% of our academy’s tuition fees.)

“Oh? Really? That’s great news.”

(With talks about training 100,000 IT talents circulating, it seems the government is willing to invest boldly in new industries for future growth.)

“Yes, haha… Ah, Chairman, I have an appointment now, so I’ll have to cut this conversation short. I’ll visit soon to discuss the rest.”

(Sure, see you then.)

After hanging up, Lee Hyun-woo smiled softly, thinking about the future.

‘I never imagined 3D printing technology would be accelerated like this.’

Somehow, it felt like 3D printing was just the beginning.

Maybe, in this life, he could achieve the dreams he only dared to dream in the 21st century.
