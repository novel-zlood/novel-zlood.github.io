The news of Macro Soft's antitrust law violation has also reached South Korea.

As a result, there were several anticipated scenarios, but overall it was reported that Macro Soft would engage in a fierce battle with the Department of Justice.

Lee Hyun-woo's perspective was no different.

'It will end with the victory of the U.S. Department of Justice.'

No matter how much he went back in time and caused significant butterfly effects, the U.S. antitrust law hadn't changed, and the government there would strive to uphold its values.

Therefore, a few years later, Macro Soft would not only be unable to bundle Internet X Cross but would also face a forced split, followed by Billy Kaites stepping down from his CEO position and transitioning to managing from behind the scenes.

Of course, it would take more time for him to completely step away from the front lines of management.

This was a process that countless monopolistic companies in the U.S. had undergone.

'If the government allows monopolies, it thinks the entity will disrupt the market with price-fixing and unfair trade...'

This was a future that Jungle might also have to face someday.

Even as of now, it was already the case.

Jungle held such a high market share in South Korea's online shopping, portal sites, and various other content areas that it had no rivals.

Of course, as the internet population grows and netizens seek diversity, the market share will decrease.

'The voices warning against monopolies will only grow louder, right?'

Lee Hyun-woo shook his head from side to side.

Unlike the U.S., South Korea's antitrust laws weren't that strong.

Moreover, as long as Lee Hyun-woo adhered to co-prosperous management, there was no reason to violate antitrust laws.

Thinking in reverse, he should be cautious about this aspect from now on.

Because as South Korea's collective intelligence rises with the spread of the internet, the general public will eventually absorb even the monopolistic information and knowledge of the social elite.

In as early as 5 to 10 years, or at the latest 15 to 20 years.

Wouldn't it be said that the invisible class structure in South Korea will be overturned?

That's why there were talks of politicians and conglomerate heads' tricks being blatantly exposed to the public, and that their level was not up to the public's.

'I should retire before that happens.'

Fortunately, Billy Kaites stepping down from the CEO position of Macro Soft seemed to be able to advance Lee Hyun-woo's retirement timing.

'Billy Kaites to step down as CEO.'

Seeing the article, Lee Hyun-woo's eyes were marked with both question marks and exclamation points.

'They're deciding this already?'

It was a completely different move from Lee Hyun-woo's calculations.

Since the scenario of Billy Kaites and Macro Soft challenging the court and U.S. values head-on, only to eventually lose and split, was different, Lee Hyun-woo was inwardly flustered.

'Did my return to the past affect his actions in some way?'

Though he didn't know how the butterfly effect worked, he became increasingly curious about Billy Kaites heading in a different direction from his previous life.

Sometimes he wondered if this was media play.

If they shocked the public by announcing the founder's resignation to avoid the various harsh stares focusing on Macro Soft's monopoly and bundling, the direction of public opinion could change.

In reality, Billy Kaites hadn't directly announced his resignation as CEO, and sympathy towards him was gradually rising in the U.S.

Overall, there was a reaction questioning whether the government was overly interfering in the free activities of businesses.

Some media outlets that advocated for a free market economy even criticized the government.

'Is the state's public power destroying the market economy?'

Seeing this, Lee Hyun-woo exclaimed.

If this was indeed media play, then the current Billy Kaites had evolved more than the one from his previous life.

He quickly judged and framed the situation as 'government intervention vs. free market economy' before being battered by the court and public opinion.

In his previous life, he couldn't do this, and thus the government and public opinion became one side and pummeled him.

'At least this time, he can rally voices supporting his side.'

Law cannot ignore public opinion.

Because the one making the judgment is human.

Then another twist followed.

'Billy Kaites to step down as CEO of Macro Soft!'

'Smith Balmer to become the new CEO of Macro Soft.'

The "expected" report that Billy Kaites would step down turned into "fact," and it was eventually confirmed as true.

'Is everything moving faster in this life than in the previous one?'

If that's the case, his decision will cause a huge ripple effect.

Lee Hyun-woo inwardly welcomed it.

'It seems like something incredibly interesting will happen.'

* * *

Whether it would be interesting or not, a few fake Nostradamuses began to emerge.

In fact, they posted on blogs under the name Nostradamus.

While there had been names like 'The Real Nostradamus,' 'Descendants of Nostradamus,' or 'Nostradamus 2,' nobody had openly used the name Nostradamus until now.

- Signs of a rebellion from computer manufacturers

- No longer necessary to forcibly install Windows!

- A new operating system will be born.

They made these kinds of claims.

Reading such blogs was quite entertaining.

Imagination is free, isn't it?

Even within the company, public opinion was being sensed.

- The content emphasized by the CEO during the last sports event is still vivid in my mind.

The post on the free bulletin board recounted what Lee Hyun-woo had said after this year's sports event.

- The CEO said that our competitor is Macro Soft, and emphasized that from the CEO of Jungle to the new employees, we must unite to surpass the world's top IT company. Although at the time, it was considered difficult to achieve that goal in a short period due to the gap between the two companies, now I think the opportunity has come faster than we expected.

In the end, the post concluded with the idea that when Billy Kaites steps down, Jungle will rapidly rise, and we should use this as momentum to catch up with Macro Soft as soon as possible.

Below it, numerous supportive comments were posted.

'This kind of pumped-up atmosphere isn't bad.'

Corporate morale was very important.

Sometimes that morale could become the driving force for growth.

The very fact that such posts could be freely uploaded indicated that the employees' sense of belonging had become stronger.

'I can't just sit idly by.'

Lee Hyun-woo also quickly typed out and posted a new message.

For Jungle in the 21st century to be higher than Macro Soft.

First, superiors should frequently say, "You can do it." The meaning of "failure" and "challenge" is implied in "You can do it."

Second, subordinates should not become nodding dolls. Jungle's growth comes from differing opinions.

Third, those who constantly study are quick to adapt to change. In a world that changes too quickly, you need to study.

Fourth, open your heart and build relationships, not positions. A company is an organization made up of people.

Fifth, don't just prepare something perfectly; take a leap. After that, improvements will lead to something better.

This content was something Lee Hyun-woo had summarized from 'The Success of Single,' a book he had read in his previous life.

Perhaps it was advice for himself as well.

'If opportunities arise, don't hesitate and charge forward.'

Single also utilized the opportunity when Macro Soft stumbled to position itself as an innovative company.

Many people actually evaluated that the company that benefited the most from Billy Kaites leaving Macro Soft was Single.

Now Jungle should take that position and sit higher and faster than Single of the previous life.

A bright smile appeared on Lee Hyun-woo's face.

At this point, it was time to think about Billy Kaites' intentions.

Lee Hyun-woo thought that he might be planning to avoid the split by changing public opinion.

'It's all good, but being a CEO and controlling from behind are different.'

Macro Soft was like an empire that dominated the IT world with its operating system and office software.

That was the problem.

Apart from operating systems and office software, it always failed.

The person who took the heat from this was Smith Balmer, Billy Kaites' successor.

In this life as well, the development was similar, so Smith Balmer was in a strong position to become the 2nd CEO.

Indeed, not long after, Smith Balmer ascended as CEO of Macro Soft, and in an interview, he emphasized that he would never touch the corporate culture that Billy Kaites had built.

At first glance, it seemed to mean inheriting Macro Soft's philosophy and values, but upon closer inspection...

'It means he's afraid of failure.'

Instead of developing new products or content through innovation, it meant he would refine what was already successful and make it even more successful.

Of course, this was how it seemed to Lee Hyun-woo, but other media were looking forward to the emergence of a new CEO.

'There was a businessman named Smith Balmer beside Billy Kaites!'

Lee Hyun-woo agreed with this article's title.

If Billy Kaites was a developer, engineer, strategist, and commander-in-chief, Smith Balmer was a sales master, advisor, and field commander.

In fact, Smith Balmer performed that role well and was highly regarded just for having supported Billy Kaites.

The problem was that he wasn't suited for roles beyond that.

Therefore, Macro Soft, which could have created an eternal empire, had to yield its position to companies like Pineapple, Amazones, or Single.

'Will it be the same in this life?'

He didn't know, but the fact that Smith Balmer's first foreign trip was to South Korea was significant.

Before deciding to visit, he asked Jungle if he could meet Lee Hyun-woo.

"There's no reason not to meet. Schedule it."

"But Billy Kaites is coming too."

"Even better. It’ll be more interesting to meet them all at once."

At Kang Dong-ho's report, Lee Hyun-woo laughed.

'It seems like Smith Balmer is coming to meet me, but isn't it the other way around?'

Perhaps it was Billy Kaites who strongly insisted on meeting Lee Hyun-woo, turning Smith Balmer's route to Korea.

Of course, they wouldn't only visit Korea but would also go to several major markets in Asia.

'Coming to our country first?'

For some reason, he felt good.

Because it made him realize that his presence had dramatically changed since he met them last year.

On the other hand, Billy Kaites had changed from CEO to behind-the-scenes controller during that time.

What kind of fun might these changed statuses and relationships bring?

Lee Hyun-woo eagerly awaited their arrival.
