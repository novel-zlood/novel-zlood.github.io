The next day, after meeting with Kim Ah-young, Lee Hyun-woo subtly probed.

"Jung-woo said he was fine yesterday."

"Oh, really? That's a relief."

"But you have to know the other person's feelings."

Kim Ah-young, understanding Lee Hyun-woo's intentions, smiled and said,

"Hoseon also said she was fine."

"Really? Is that true?"

"But it's a bit ambiguous."

"Ambiguous? How so?"

"It doesn't seem like she meant 'fine' as a man."

"Oh, I think I get it. My brother is similar. He mostly talked about development."

When men and women meet for the first time, they are usually more curious about each other’s personal information. Although such topics might not have been entirely absent, from Lee Jung-woo’s words, it seemed like their conversation focused on search engines and game development.

"But it was the same when you and I first met."

Kim Ah-young, feeling slightly guilty, nodded her head.

Of course, their initial encounters were entangled in business, but Kim Ah-young had intentionally scheduled frequent meetings to see Lee Hyun-woo more often.

It was easy to understand when recalling their trip to Japan for the launch of 【Jungle Japan】, where their romantic relationship naturally began without a confession when Lee Hyun-woo held her hand.

"So, I'm grateful to you. Finding a connection for my brother shouldn't be about finding the ideal type but rather someone he can communicate well with."

"Listening to you, I'm curious about something..."

"Hmm?"

"Never mind."

When Kim Ah-young hesitated, Lee Hyun-woo tilted his head.

Then, quickly realizing,

"It's absolutely not that you're not my ideal type! Where would I find another woman like you in the world?"

It seems even Lee Hyun-woo can get flustered.

Seeing him flustered while trying to explain himself made her feel good for no reason.

"You read my mind."

"You are my ideal type, and we communicate well."

"That's enough. I understand. It seems like I forced you."

"Haha..."

"But besides that, I find a lot of things about you strange."

"What is it?"

"Sometimes, you care too much about Jung-woo's business. As if you have some guilt."

"Ah... that? Actually, Jung-woo has been compared to me since we were young because of me. I feel a bit sorry for that."

To be exact, he felt sorry throughout his entire previous life.

If he had at least lived well, it might have been different, but he struggled economically and had significant complexes about his older brother.

So, during holidays, he often heard thorny words.

- Mom, aren't you discriminating too much between sister-in-law and my wife? My wife is also pregnant. Why are you asking us to come this holiday? Shouldn't my brother step in at times like this? Honestly, who helps mom more often during holidays and kimjang? Who always comes late and leaves early using the excuse of being busy?

Although what Jung-woo said was right, at that time, Lee Hyun-woo had to be mindful of his wife's feelings.

As a workaholic, he also felt sorry for his wife and children.

‘I hope it’s different this time.’

When Lee Hyun-woo returned to the past, his goals were to be a filial son, a good husband, and a respected father. If there were a fourth goal, it would be to be a good brother.

Although Lee Jung-woo was still in his prime, the reason Lee Hyun-woo worried about him not having a girlfriend was precisely that.

"Seeing Jung-woo working all night conscious of me doesn't look good. That's why I care a lot."

"I see. Now I understand."

"Thank goodness. Thanks for understanding."

"Thinking about it, you and your family seem normal. When I see your parents, you, and Jung-woo, you seem like a real family."

"Huh? Why the sudden change in tone?"

"Oh? Did it sound like I was saying my family is not good? That's not it... My family is, how should I put it... we recognize each other as family, but there's a bit of friction or competitive spirit. And there's a lot of interference, and we care a lot about appearances. For example, when our youngest wanted to do design, everyone protested."

"Oh, right! What happened to Na-yoon?"

"She failed in design. Instead, she got into the Economics Department at 【Isook Women's University】. Everyone except her is satisfied. So, I think I overreacted."

Lee Hyun-woo seemed to understand.

In Kim Ah-young’s family, there were invisible lines and rules to follow because they were part of the 【Guseong】 family, and Kim Na-yoon kept trying to break out of that mold.

‘Maybe it’s because of me.’

Lee Hyun-woo was one of the people who influenced Kim Na-yoon.

Though he didn’t know much else, he had encouraged her to be active on her blog.

"Na-yoon must be feeling down."

"Yes. We welcomed her with smiles, not knowing that... sigh..."

Kim Ah-young let out a small sigh and then said,

"I think I should go and comfort her today."

"Let me do it too."

"Hmm?"

"Since I'm doing it, let me comfort her too."

"That would be great. She kind of sees you as a role model, you know?"

* * *

Indeed, after their meal, Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young went to Hannam-dong and called out Kim Na-yoon.

Since things could get complicated if Lee Hyun-woo went in, he gave her a gift and comforted her outside.

"Thank you, brother-in-law!"

"Sure, come visit often if you're bored. I'll treat you to something delicious."

"Yes, I will!"

Maybe it was because he didn’t have a sister-in-law in his previous life, but Lee Hyun-woo found Kim Na-yoon extremely adorable.

And then,

‘I hope Na-yoon doesn't have any sad days in this life.’

Lee Hyun-woo also resolved to support Kim Na-yoon from the side to ensure she could live brightly, unlike in his past life.

That’s why he sent Kim Na-yoon the following text on his way home.

- Youngest sister-in-law.

- Yes?

- The information and communication course at the 21st Century Venture Business Association.

- Yes.

- It’s quite good. I’ve been attending it for almost a month now.

The reason he couldn’t write long texts was that the mobile phone’s capacity hadn’t yet caught up with that of the 21st century.

Fortunately, technology was much more advanced than in his previous life, allowing for text conversations like this.

- Really?

Also, the context of his text was essentially a suggestion for her to enroll and attend, leading to Kim Na-yoon's follow-up questions.

- Then can I attend too?

- Why not? I’m attending too, aren’t I?

- Yes, I know. I occasionally see it in the news.

Imagining Kim Na-yoon’s excited expression as she sent the text, Lee Hyun-woo’s lips formed a smile.

But,

- That’s why it’s more of a problem.

Now, an image of Kim Na-yoon’s sullen face floated in his mind.

- Why?

- If I attend, it seems like I’ll keep appearing in the news.

- So what? I don’t really care about that anymore.

How shameless.

Lee Hyun-woo had told Kim Sung-moo during their meeting on January 1st that he would refrain from media exposure as much as possible.

In reality, the meaning behind the listener and speaker’s words was different.

Kim Sung-moo didn’t want anyone associated with 【Guseong】 to appear in the media.

So, he had indirectly asked Lee Hyun-woo to keep his face out of the news as much as possible, but Lee Hyun-woo had interpreted it as a request not to be involved in any scandals.

As long as he didn’t actively engage with the media and give interviews, he considered it an effort on his part.

Honestly, neither Kim Sung-moo nor Kim Tae-hyun wanted it, but they still appeared in the news.

Since the two were the head and successor of 【Guseong】, the media and the public were always interested, so it was impossible for them not to appear in the news.

It was the same for Lee Hyun-woo.

The reason the media kept writing about him was due to their interest in him as the CEO of 【Jungle】.

So, he pushed back confidently.

- Honestly, wanting to learn more isn't a bad thing, right?

- That’s true.

- And recently, reporters haven’t been showing up either.

- Really?

- Yes, how boring is it to keep reporting the same stories?

- Oh, really? Then should I register?

- You shouldn't give up on your dreams, youngest sister-in-law.

- You’re right!

- And you should also study hard at school.

- Yes, you’re right!

- Study information and communication for self-development as well.

- Yes, yes, I will!

They were indeed a well-matched brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

A smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo’s face.

‘Just as Ah-young cares for Jung-woo, I should also care for my sisters-in-law.’

Would Kim Ah-young’s other family members want this?

That was unknown, but Kim Ah-young had clearly said earlier.

That Lee Hyun-woo’s family felt like a real family.

A real family respects the dreams of its members and tries to help them in any way they can.

‘Today was another fulfilling day.’

* * *

The next day.

As Kim Na-yoon was heading out, her mother, Jang Hee-jin, called her.

"Na-yoon, where are you going?"

"Just... to meet Ji-soo."

Park Ji-soo was Kim Na-yoon’s best friend.

She was also the one who met Lee Hyun-woo at the hamburger shop last time.

Of course, today’s outing included meeting her, but in reality, it was to register at the information and communication academy run by the 21st Century Venture Business Association.

After exchanging texts with Lee Hyun-woo the previous night, she researched online and found that the academy had a very high satisfaction rate among its students.

"Oh, really? I was planning to buy you some clothes today."

"It’s okay. I have a lot of clothes."

"But since you're starting school, you should get some new spring clothes. You really don’t have many clothes if I look closely."

"I have a lot of clothes."

"Alright, alright. We’ll go shopping another time then."

"Yes..."

"Cheer up! Why is an Economics student at 【Isook University】 so down?"

It was, of course, because she hadn't been accepted into the department she wanted.

Even though Jang Hee-jin knew this, she deliberately emphasized the Economics Department of 【Isook Women's University】.

In fact, even the wives of conglomerates had to maintain face, and when they attended gatherings, they couldn't avoid talking about their children.

At least if her daughter attended the best women's university, she could somewhat save face.

“……”

Knowing this, Kim Na-yoon left the house without a word.

Also, the chauffeur followed, but she insisted on using public transportation.

“Don’t worry. I’ll make up a good excuse for mom.”

If the driver knew, her whereabouts would be exposed.

Would her mom be happy to know she was attending that academy?

‘No way.’

Thinking this far, her expression suddenly brightened, and a radiant smile spread across her face.

It felt like all the stress and gloom had vanished.

‘As expected, my brother-in-law understands me well.’

To her, Lee Hyun-woo was like a breath of fresh air in her stifling daily life.

‘Honestly, my family is so boring. It’s not fun, and sometimes it feels suffocating.’

Of course, it might sound like a complaint from someone who had everything.

Ordinary people might frown and criticize her, saying how lucky she was to be born into the 【Guseong】 family.

But they wouldn’t understand what it felt like to be a bird in a cage or a fish in a bowl.

However, recently, the atmosphere in her house had been slightly changing.

How should she put it? It felt like a window had been slightly opened in a room filled with stifling and heavy air.

It all started when Lee Hyun-woo first came to the house.

‘If my sister and brother-in-law get married, it will change even more, right?’

She looked forward to that day. She hoped they would get married soon.
