At this point, Lee Hyun-woo narrowed his eyes and recalled the subjunctive mood.

Various events flashed through his mind like a lantern slideshow.

‘If I had received investments from someone, would I have been able to bulk buy Clonz's CDs directly?’

Of course, he would have secured his stable share first before receiving investments, so he wouldn't have faced significant opposition.

However, if such interference accumulated, it would be impossible not to be affected at all.

In conclusion, it seemed better not to receive investments...

"Ah! I just thought of a fantastic idea!"

He unintentionally raised his voice at the sudden flash of inspiration.

Everyone in the office turned to look at him.

Aware of the attention, Lee Hyun-woo gave a wry smile.

"Ah, sorry. Please continue with your work."

But the wry smile soon turned into a meaningful grin on his lips.

‘Alright, if I go with this idea, I can efficiently use investments from Kim Tae-hyun and Chairman Son Jung-yi of 【Software Bank】.’

Lee Hyun-woo quickly reviewed the idea that had just come to him.

It was about expanding overseas, specifically to Japan.

‘There's no proper portal site in Japan yet.’

The same goes for online shopping.

It seemed like a heaven-sent opportunity.

‘Okay, let's push forward with this.’

This time too, he needed the mindset of ‘if it doesn’t work, so be it.’

In other words, it meant he didn't try to design a perfect scenario.

It's a world full of unexpected variables.

If he confined the plan to a rigid framework, it could become too rigid. So, he resolved to meet the two people later and concretize the plan for entering Japan.

For now, he returned to his original mission, making phone calls and sending invitations.

Just then, Han Se-jin made a request to him.

"How about you handle the matter with 【Aejeong Cosmetics】 yourself?"

"Me?"

"Actually, the manager there seems to feel a bit disappointed with you, sir."

"Disappointed? With me, why…."

"Last time, you gave advice on low-cost cosmetics and pushed the project forward. They once asked for your help. You said you'd call back, but they haven't heard from you yet."

Hearing this, Lee Hyun-woo tried to recall.

"Ah! That time!"

He remembered the situation when he received the call.

It was quite some time ago.

He was having beer with Kim Ah-young at a pub in Jongno when Choi Sun-hwa contacted him.

She had mentioned that the low-cost cosmetics were almost ready.

She wanted to link it to 【Jungle】's advertising, but Lee Hyun-woo suggested discussing it later, and the conversation was cut off.

“What about the low-cost cosmetics?”

“The advertising starts next Friday. The launch is planned for the following week.”

“You’re aiming for after the college entrance exam is over. That’s a good strategy.”

“Yes, but while mentioning that…”

At this point, Han Se-jin read from his notes.

“The busy CEO of 【Jungle】 is so hard to reach that my neck is about to break waiting for his call…”

“Got it. I’ll contact her.”

Lee Hyun-woo smiled as he interrupted Han Se-jin, who was reading from the notes.

‘This time, it’s my fault.’

Choi Sun-hwa was the first banner advertiser for Jungle.

Since she wasn’t an insignificant person, contacting her was the right thing to do.

Lee Hyun-woo immediately called Choi Sun-hwa.

After a few rings, he heard her voice.

(Hello?)

“It’s me, Lee Hyun-woo.”

(Oh? Yes, CEO Lee.)

“I was talking with Team Leader Han Se-jin, and I heard that your low-cost cosmetics brand is about to be launched. Ah, I should apologize first for the delayed contact.”

(It’s okay. These things happen when you’re busy.)

He expected a disappointed voice but was met with a cheerful tone from Choi Sun-hwa instead.

Feeling a bit more sorry for abruptly ending the call last time, he told her he would pay more attention to the banner advertisement and invited her on Monday. Choi Sun-hwa readily accepted the invitation.

(Since you invited me, I’ll come with both hands full.)

“Oh, you don’t have to go that far.”

(Should I bring an envelope of money then?)

“Hey, why are you saying that? If you keep this up, I’ll tell you to bring large bills instead of small change.”

(Since you’re going to make it big, that’s how it should be.)

“Hahaha.”

Feeling good, Lee Hyun-woo couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

‘This woman has a refreshing personality and doesn’t hold grudges.’

He liked the fact that she wasn’t upset despite the abrupt end of their call.

Of course, this thought was brief.

He had to make more calls, starting with Choi Sun-hwa.

After finishing almost all the calls, he announced to the office staff.

“Alright, we’ll start moving the furniture from tomorrow. Make sure to pack your things well!”

Was it because he considered this a second founding?

Lee Hyun-woo’s voice seemed to be mixed with pleasant dopamine.

* * *

And then, the following Monday.

So many people visited Jungle that the nearby parking lot was completely full.

Lee Hyun-woo's parents, who had arrived early, received explanations from Lee Jung-woo as people came.

"That's Clonz over there. You know them, right?"

"Of course, I do."

"Next to them is Kim Yoon-sun."

"Yes, I know her too."

"Oh?"

"Why?"

"The eldest daughter of the Guseong Group is here."

"What?"

"That woman is also Hyung’s friend. Just a friend, like Kim Yoon-sun."

He omitted "so far."

He couldn’t say it because Kim Ah-young had already approached them.

Kim Ah-young, dressed neatly and with clear features, greeted them with a smile.

"Hello."

"Oh, yes. Hello?"

Her cheerful voice made Lee Jung-woo smile automatically.

Of course, his parents looked a bit bewildered.

But then.

"This is my oppa."

Looking at the man Kim Ah-young introduced as her oppa, Lee Jung-woo had a similar expression.

There could only be one person Kim Ah-young called oppa.

The heir of the Guseong Group, Kim Tae-hyun!

"Ah…."

Lee Jung-woo was so flustered that he lost his words but quickly pulled himself together and greeted him.

"Ah, ah… Hello."

But he couldn’t help but stammer.

"Yes, nice to meet you."

Receiving a greeting from the heir, the tension soared.

But Lee Jung-woo didn’t forget to introduce his parents by his side.

"These are our parents."

"Yes, nice to meet you."

"Hello. Nice to meet you. Hohoho."

Seeing Kim Ah-young greet them more politely than usual, Lee Jung-woo couldn’t help but find her likable.

Did she really have an interest in his hyung?

Was she trying to impress their parents too?

‘Ah, what am I thinking?’

Pushing aside unnecessary thoughts, he quickly led the two to his hyung.

Lee Hyun-woo was also greeting guests and approached when he saw the siblings coming.

“You both found your way here well.”

“Congratulations on the expansion, CEO Lee.”

“Congratulations.”

“Thank you. Thank you, Ah-young.”

“Oh? You two are on a first-name basis…”

“Ah, we decided to be friends, oppa.”

“Yes, that’s how it turned out.”

“……”

“By the way, you said you had something to discuss, right? How about now, since we’re busy?”

Sensing the slight awkwardness, Kim Ah-young shifted the conversation to business.

Kim Tae-hyun nodded and looked at Lee Hyun-woo.

“I have something important to discuss…”

“Oh, yes. Shall we go this way?”

Already knowing what the conversation would be about, Lee Hyun-woo led the siblings to the CEO's office on the 7th floor.

The CEO’s office had all kinds of tea, but since both asked for hazelnut, he personally brewed coffee, and they enjoyed the taste and aroma while having a brief chat.

“Not sure if you’ve heard, but I actually want to invest in 【Jungle】.”

Finally, Kim Tae-hyun revealed his ambition.

Thinking that the moment had come, Lee Hyun-woo nodded.

Then, he smoothly brought up the next topic.

“I’d like to use the investment not in our country but in Japan. Is that okay?”

Kim Tae-hyun’s eyebrows raised.

“Japan?”

“Actually, I heard Son Jung-yi is planning to invest, so I thought it was a perfect opportunity. I’ve been considering when to venture overseas, and this seems like the right time to enter Japan and use both of your investments efficiently.”

Always unpredictable, Lee Hyun-woo surprised the siblings once again.

And he didn’t stop there.

“To explain in more detail…”

As if he had planned this situation beforehand, he started outlining his plan.

To summarize what he said:

First, Japan currently lacks a significant portal site and online shopping presence.

Second, if 【Jungle】 enters this untouched blue ocean, they can not only navigate smoothly but also dominate the future Japanese online market.

Third, the challenge is that it won’t be easy without local assistance. Therefore, they need to partner with Son Jung-yi, Chairman of 【Software Bank】. They will provide the technology and operational know-how from 【Jungle】.

Fourth, to firmly establish their presence initially, additional capital investment is necessary.

Fifth, thus they should accept investments from both Kim Tae-hyun and Son Jung-yi with an open mind.

Sixth, neither Son Jung-yi nor Kim Tae-hyun can own more than 30% of 【Jungle Japan】 (provisional name).

Although it was a lengthy explanation, it was very clear and organized.

Thus, the siblings nodded in understanding throughout.

“What about me?”

Suddenly, Kim Ah-young interjected.

Both Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Tae-hyun turned their gazes to her.

“Huh?”

“……?”

“I want to invest too.”

“……!”

“……?”

It was something no one had discussed with her.

So Lee Hyun-woo looked at Kim Tae-hyun, who, with a surprised expression, stared at Kim Ah-young.

Moreover, he called out to his sister in a scolding tone.

“Ah-young…”

“I actually asked Secretary Park to investigate the feasibility of investing in 【Jungle Soft】.”

“What?”

“Just before coming here, she told me. She said I must invest.”

It seemed like she was insisting, but the truth was that their family had no mercy when it came to business.

It was truly a survival of the fittest.

Their father, Kim Sung-moo, had endorsed and encouraged this.

Thus, Kim Tae-hyun stopped looking at Kim Ah-young and turned his gaze to Lee Hyun-woo, proposing.

“There’s a branch of 【Guseong】 in Japan too. Oh, can I drop the formalities since you're my sister’s friend?”

“Sure.”

“If we use the personnel from 【Guseong】 Japan, it will be helpful. We wouldn’t need Son Jung-yi’s investment.”

Kim Tae-hyun spoke as if he was making a concession.

The reason was simple.

Including his younger sister would shrink his share of the pie.

Human nature driven by greed is always the same.

They can’t stand their share getting smaller, so he had no choice but to exclude someone else, namely Son Jung-yi.

But he misunderstood one thing.

The one receiving the investment had the upper hand, not the investors.

Soon, Lee Hyun-woo’s firm voice was heard.

“That’s not possible.”
