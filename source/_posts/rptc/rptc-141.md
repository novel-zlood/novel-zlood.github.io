Meanwhile, after successfully completing the press conference, Lee Hyun-woo was holding a meeting with the employees who had come with him from Korea.

Generally, the ones speaking were team leaders Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo.

Of the two, Oh Min-woo talked more, and being a narcissist, he poured out the following without any filter.

"Now, we'll have to change the search engine reluctantly. I can already picture the faces of those who have no choice but to make this decision."

What he was talking about now was the predicted moves of the management of various media companies following the change in the search engine of 【Alta Vista】.

The words he spat out contained the relative superiority of the 【Jungle】 search engine, and he even went so far as to make overly optimistic predictions.

"Most likely, like Team Corner, they should boldly choose and sign the contract while the CEO is staying in the U.S."

Someone quickly brought him back to reality from his optimistic judgment.

"But the CEO's schedule is already full, so I don't know if they'll have the opportunity."

"If not, they should come to Korea. Isn't it the thirsty person who digs the well?"

The person who had just spoken to Oh Min-woo was Shin Dong-woon, who had been hired shortly before coming to the U.S. and had experience working at a Wall Street financial firm.

It was unclear whether Lee Hyun-woo had brought him to the U.S. because of this experience, but seeing Oh Min-woo's excessive confidence, he didn't know what to say.

‘What if people who used 【Alta Vista】's search engine switch to another one?’

The other search engine he was thinking of was naturally portals like 【Yaho】.

Not wanting to lose even a single user, Shin Dong-woon quickly said,

"Still, just in case, how about we ask the hotel to set up voicemail boxes for the two team leaders?"

"We've already done that."

"Oh, you have."

Although it was a short time, he had thought that Oh Min-woo seemed like someone who didn't know much about management outside of development.

‘Did the CEO tell him to do that?’

At least, Lee Hyun-woo, being the CEO, wouldn't miss this opportunity, he thought.

When he turned his gaze to Lee Hyun-woo with this thought,

"It's time. You probably didn't sleep well due to jet lag, so let's end it here and have some free time."

Just as he was looking at his wristwatch, Lee Hyun-woo unexpectedly decided to end the meeting.

‘What did we even accomplish in this meeting?’

At best, a few rosy forecasts and the setup of voicemail boxes?

Frankly, Shin Dong-woon had followed with the determination to make his abilities known during this U.S. trip and gain the CEO's favor.

‘Did I make the right choice?’

He had knocked on the door of 【Jungle】 as a last resort, thinking it was impossible to endure any longer on Wall Street.

Looking at it now, it seemed like the company was like a cow stumbling upon a golden rat.

As soon as the meeting ended, the reason he asked for time with Lee Hyun-woo was because of this.

"Time?"

"Yes. I didn't even get a chance to have a one-on-one with you due to preparing for the U.S. trip."

"Oh… that's right. Then, shall we have a cup of coffee?"

"……."

Although not strictly enforced, when a new face, whether a newbie or an experienced hire, joins 【Jungle】, it was said that Lee Hyun-woo would have a one-on-one with them.

Shin Dong-woon also interpreted it this way.

If a young team leader picks the wrong person, it would be troublesome for the company, so the CEO does an in-depth interview as a second filter.

‘But is that not it?’

Lee Hyun-woo seemed to act in a way that suggested he might do an interview whenever he felt like it, rather than now.

Fortunately, while having a cup of coffee, he was asked about his dreams.

He spoke confidently about his aspirations.

"At the very least, I want to elevate 【Jungle】 to the top position in the global IT industry."

"Then it will be the world's top company."

"Yes, I'll assist in making it the world's top IT company."

Listening to this answer, Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

When he said the world's top company, he meant the undisputed number one company.

However, Shin Dong-woon kept repeating that he meant the top in IT.

‘Well, IT isn't one of the top global industries at the moment.’

Currently, it was an era where companies like 【Walmart】, 【General Electric】, or energy and financial companies were dominating.

【Macro Soft】 was doing well, but it was just barely making its name among the top 20 groups.

"But actually, I was asking about a different kind of dream."

"Yes? What kind?"

"I meant a dream not necessarily related to your job. For example, my dream is to be a filial son, a good husband, and a respected father."

"Oh… yes, that's a good dream. But for me…"

Shin Dong-woon paused for a moment and then answered with a gloomy expression.

"It's a dream that's not easy to achieve."

"Exactly. Maybe that's even harder than making a top company. Don't you think?"

"……."

Having experienced a divorce already, it was hard for him to say, but such a response?

Shin Dong-woon couldn't respond and just blinked.

In the meantime, another question came in.

"Then, what's your hobby?"

"Hobby? Stock investment…"

"Not that, something unrelated to making money."

"Oh, yes… I used to be so stressed that I learned to play the drums."

"Drums! That's nice. Hitting the drums must really relieve stress."

"Well… yes, it does."

"That's great. I actually have a favor to ask."

"Yes? A favor?"

"Yes, I'm thinking of promoting a company club once we get back to Korea. How about starting a music club? I'm interested in it. I even dream of forming an amateur band someday."

"……."

He was at a loss for words again today.

‘But if it means he wants to join the club I create and form a band together, that's not bad.’

To get on the good side of a superior, frequent interaction is crucial.

Seeing it as a very good opportunity, he barely managed a smile and nodded.

"Yes, I'll do that."

"Thank you. Really, thank you."

Lee Hyun-woo was excessively delighted.

It was because he felt he could finally create a band and play the songs he had long wanted to hear in his previous life.

Of course, he still needed to find an employee who could compose.

‘I can find one. I've been discovering people with various hobbies during interviews.’

Sometimes martial arts, sometimes Go, sometimes hiking, and so on.

Whenever he discovered employees who had hobbies he wanted to learn in his previous life, Lee Hyun-woo would encourage them to start a club.

Now, if he could find someone with a talent for composing and learn from them, he could create precious songs.

‘A masterpiece shouldn't be buried.’

He would definitely succeed.

After the interview, Shin Dong-woon came out.

"Whew…"

He couldn't get a grip on himself.

‘He doesn't want to talk about work at all. I subtly mentioned stocks and finance, but he changed the subject.’

Moreover, during the interview, Kim Ah-young from 【Guseong Group】 came by, so the rest was postponed.

Did he not like him?

From his expression, it didn't seem like it, so he couldn't grasp Lee Hyun-woo’s intentions.

But as soon as he got back to his accommodation, another quirky person, as unpredictable as Lee Hyun-woo, was waiting for him.

It was none other than Oh Min-woo.

"Oh? Manager Shin?"

"Ah, yes, Team Leader Oh."

Each department had teams, and because of his experience on Wall Street, Shin Dong-woon had secured a manager position.

Knowing this or not, Oh Min-woo immediately asked him a question.

"Did you work on Wall Street?"

"Yes, yes. I did."

"Then, do you know 【Natural Standard Fund】?"

"Of course. It's a very large fund. But why..."

"They left me a voicemail asking to meet."

"What? Why would they… want to meet you…?"

"That's what I'm saying. Why would they want to meet me? I came to ask you that…"

"……."

Shin Dong-woon found himself speechless several times today.

‘Is he asking me to guess?’

After thinking for a second, Shin Dong-woon quickly came up with an answer.

"They might have asked to meet because the CEO's schedule is full. Maybe they want to invest in our company."

"Oh… is that it?"

"If not, there's no reason for a hedge fund to contact us."

"I'm not the one who decides on investments, so, ah, I shouldn't meet them."

"Wait, but it might be good to meet them, hear them out, and then relay it to the CEO…"

"I'm as busy as the CEO. I don't want to fill my schedule with unnecessary meetings."

"Then… shall I go instead?"

Stuttering, Shin Dong-woon saw an opportunity and asked.

‘This is a chance. If I can secure investment funds and report it to the CEO…’

Wouldn't he be recognized and trusted?

Luckily, Oh Min-woo nodded as if it was a bother.

"Go ahead. I'll give you the contact information from the voicemail."

"Yes, thank you."

"I should be the one thanking you. I have plans to go clubbing with Jung-woo tonight."

"……."

Like father, like son.

Shin Dong-woon fell into thought again.

‘Did I really make the right choice joining this company?’

Seeing financial people these days connecting with the IT sector and moving, he had chosen 【Jungle】 over prestigious financial firms.

‘I don't know. Really.’

* * *

Meanwhile, Lee Hyun-woo, who was having dinner with Kim Ah-young in the hotel restaurant, received a visit from his younger brother, Lee Jung-woo.

"Hyung, sorry to interrupt your good time."

"No, it's okay. What's up?"

"Well…"

At this point, Lee Jung-woo glanced at Kim Ah-young.

He seemed to be contemplating whether to talk or not.

Naturally, if he gave such a look, his brother would either stand up or Kim Ah-young would leave.

But.

"It's okay. Go ahead."

As Kim Ah-young tried to get up, Lee Hyun-woo told him to just talk.

Hesitant, Lee Jung-woo blurted out.

"Actually, 【Yaho】 left a voicemail for Min-woo. They want to meet."

Because it was such a business-like yet ambiguous matter, he brought it up,

"If he told you about it, Min-woo must have said he wouldn't meet them."

Lee Hyun-woo responded calmly.

"He said it's a waste of time. It's obvious what they'll discuss."

"Well, it is obvious. He doesn't like obvious things either."

"Still, praise him later. That guy is simple; he'll be extremely happy with your praise."

"Got it. But where are you going?"

Lee Hyun-woo, nodding, noticed his brother's attire and asked.

"Oh, the club."

"Club?"

"Yeah, Min-woo insisted we go since we didn't get to last time."

"Sounds fun."

"Hey, you shouldn't go, hyung. Enjoy the rest of your evening."

"Okay, got it. You too."

After the brothers' conversation ended and Lee Jung-woo left, Kim Ah-young chuckled and shook her head.

"What do you have that makes them so loyal to you?"

"What do you mean?"

"Clearly, if 【Yaho】 wants to meet, it must be for poaching, right?"

"Yeah, it's obvious."

"Obvious? They must be discussing money and conditions, no? It's fascinating that they don't even look at it and choose to stay with you."

Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

Then he said,

"That's because you don't know. Of course, 【Yaho】 misjudged. Min-woo can't be tempted with money."

"Then what can tempt him?"

"Fun?"

"What?"

"You just need to have fun with him. In other words, the workplace has to be a playground for him."

"Fun? A playground? What kind of workplace is like that? Are you saying 【Jungle】 is like that?"

"Unfortunately, not yet. But we're working on it, so maybe that day will come someday."
