Meanwhile, after finishing the meeting, Lee Hyun-woo hurriedly set out.

Since the reorganization of the company was somewhat completed, it was urgent to finalize the work to secure more places for the employees to stay.

"How many times has it been already?"

Initially, they operated out of his parents' house, then moved out and got an office with the help of Kim Yun-soo. After expanding next door, around this time last year, they rented a new seven-story building.

However, the growth of 【Jungle】 far exceeded Lee Hyun-woo's expectations, and they had to rent another ten-story building in the first half of this year.

Until then, he thought they wouldn't need more space for a while.

But who would have known that even with the new remote work format introduced through continuous hiring, more buildings would still be needed?

"Will we be able to stay for a long time this time?"

Fortunately, Han Se-jin, who looked for the place on behalf of Lee Hyun-woo, reported that a 23-story building nearby was available, so they were on their way there.

“That’s the building that was used by 【Shinhan Construction】.”

“The one that went bankrupt recently?”

“Yes, that’s right.”

This conversation was not with Lee Hyun-woo but between the two managers, Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho.

The two often used this method to subtly deliver new information to Lee Hyun-woo's ears.

“Ah, speaking of 【Shinhan Construction】, it reminds me of Jang Kang-hyun, who became the head of the design department.”

“Right. He used to be with 【Shinhan Construction】. I heard he was quite good at creating various designs needed for a construction company.”

“Where did you hear that?”

“I met CEO Gu Man-hoe by chance recently. You know, the CEO of 【Internet Goblin Market】.”

“Of course, I know. Besides that site, they also connect recruiting companies and job seekers through 【Online Headhunter】. We owe them a lot recently, and I heard they’ve been receiving a lot of investments.”

“Yes, that's right. Anyway, since they handle human resource information, he seemed to have heard a lot from here and there. He even went out of his way to tell me some information about Jang Kang-hyun.”

“He seems to have a strong sense of direction as well as skill.”

“That’s why he received a lot of jealousy and envy around him. 【Shinhan Construction】 wasn’t his first job.”

“Unfortunately, he had to move jobs again due to the bankruptcy.”

“Rather than unfortunate, it’s lucky for him. Our company probably suits his style perfectly.”

“That’s true. We usually trust and leave people to their work without shaking their personal convictions.”

Lee Hyun-woo smiled as he watched their conversation lead to immense pride in the company.

“Let's see how far their conversation goes.”

Lee Hyun-woo closed his eyes slightly and continued to listen to their conversation.

“Moreover, these days, it's not just one or two companies that are collapsing, isn’t it a blessing and an honor to join our company?”

“Of course. Isn't information and communication the trend these days? Moreover, are we just any information and communication company? Aren't we the best in the industry?”

“That's right. And honestly, a company growing this rapidly at once is probably unprecedented in history. Maybe because of that, there are quite a few places that got into trouble trying to follow our company.”

“Really?”

“Yes, hold on a second.”

Han Se-jin took out a notebook, found something he had written down, and quickly spoke.

“A certain site company received money from investors and ended up in a legal dispute.”

“What? That happened?”

“It was in this morning’s newspaper. I make sure to jot down the information and communication news.”

“Which company?”

“The article just mentioned a certain company, so I don’t know exactly, but it seems that someone took advantage of the desire to grow and invested money while writing down provisions like management changes in the contract.”

“Wow…”

“When you look at things like this, you can see how incredible our CEO is. Not only does he not accept investments recklessly, but he also knows the contents of the contracts well.”

“Considering his age, it’s just puzzling where he gained all this experience.”

“I feel the same way. Ha ha ha.”

They openly praised him.

So Lee Hyun-woo closed his eyes.

Pretending not to hear, pretending to be asleep.

It was just too embarrassing to sit there with a straight face as they praised him.

Fortunately, it seemed they had reached their destination.

The driver spoke.

“We’ve arrived.”

“Let’s get off.”

“Yes, CEO.”

“Yes, CEO.”

At least within 【Jungle】, it seemed Lee Hyun-woo was just short of being deified.

* * *

Now was not the time to be picky, so Lee Hyun-woo wanted to look around the building and meet the creditors of 【Shinhan Construction】 right away.

After taking care of lunch nearby, he rushed to the creditor bank, took advantage of their impatience, and negotiated the price down.

Although he hadn't signed the final agreement yet, the two secretaries who watched the process from the side were astounded.

Naturally, the way back was also filled with praises for Lee Hyun-woo.

He was about to be placed on par with a god.

Riiiing.

The ringing of the phone saved Lee Hyun-woo.

“Hello?”

(Ah, CEO, it’s me.)

“Oh? CEO Gu?”

Listening to the voice, it was Gu Man-hoe of 【Internet Goblin Market】.

(I was thinking about visiting you, is it a good time?)

“Of course, come anytime. The door to my office is always open.”

(Then can I head there now?)

“Yes, please do. I’m outside right now, but I think we’ll arrive around the same time.”

(Alright, see you soon then.)

After hanging up, Lee Hyun-woo spoke to the two curious people.

“It’s CEO Gu Man-hoe.”

“Oh, what for…”

“He’s coming to see me, I suppose I’ll find out the reason soon.”

“Could it be to provide information on new and experienced hires?”

“Ah, that could be it.”

Kang Dong-ho asked Lee Hyun-woo, but Han Se-jin answered.

“As I mentioned earlier, he has fully accumulated that information. What should I say? Ah, hold on. One of the words the CEO mentioned before…”

At this point, Han Se-jin opened his notebook again and found something.

“Big Data! CEO Gu Man-hoe is a human big data. Ha ha ha.”

Considering it an apt metaphor, he laughed cheerfully.

Lee Hyun-woo couldn't help but smile too.

At this time, the term ‘big data’ wasn't commonly used.

Yet, Han Se-jin noted it down and started using it.

“By the way, we were supposed to schedule an appointment with that CEO soon, so is this… a good thing?”

“Well…”

The two started to gauge Lee Hyun-woo’s reaction.

Originally, 【Internet Goblin Market】 was Lee Hyun-woo’s recent acquisition target.

“It’s a good thing. We don't have to make a separate appointment.”

Lee Hyun-woo nodded and smiled at the two.

The site itself was good, but he particularly liked 【Online Headhunter】, which was developed under the commission of 【Jungle】, and he was keen on bringing in Gu Man-hoe to handle the talent acquisition for 【Jungle】.

“I should bring it up subtly today.”

Whatever the purpose of the visit, Lee Hyun-woo was determined to persuade Gu Man-hoe.

Come to think of it, this seemed to be the first acquisition since the establishment of 【Jungle】.

* * *

A little later.

As soon as Lee Hyun-woo entered the CEO’s office, he asked Yoo Jin-young.

“Has CEO Gu Man-hoe arrived yet?”

“No, he’s waiting in the CEO’s office.”

“Oh, dear…”

Hurrying, he opened the door and entered to find Gu Man-hoe rising from the sofa and bowing to Lee Hyun-woo.

It might be a misunderstanding, but Gu Man-hoe’s expression didn’t look very good.

“Hello, CEO. Long time no see.”

“Oh, yes. Long time no see. Please sit. Secretary Yoo, I’ll have a coffee.”

“Yes, CEO.”

Lee Hyun-woo smiled and sat on the sofa before asking Gu Man-hoe.

“So, how have you been?”

“A lot has happened.”

“What kind of things?”

“Due to investments from here and there, there’s been trouble at the company.”

“What kind of trouble?”

“A management dispute, I suppose? Anyway, it’s really complicated.”

“Ah…”

This was a common occurrence.

To be precise, it was a very frequent problem in his past life.

In fact, many venture companies and young CEOs that sprang up like mushrooms didn’t know how to manage a company well.

As a result, they would eagerly accept any investments offered, signing contracts or agreements without even reading them.

This often led to them losing their companies later.

“The place the two secretaries were talking about earlier must have been here.”

As concern flashed across Lee Hyun-woo’s face, Gu Man-hoe’s voice came through again.

“There might be battles in court soon, but I thought I should inform you in advance. Because the recruitment process might not be smooth from now on.”

“Really?”

“Yes, the new management I mentioned earlier has sent new executives. And now, they want to focus on more profitable ventures.”

“So? How do they plan to make a profit?”

“They say they will charge advertising fees to job seekers.”

“What the…”

“Of course, I did not agree to it. But not only new executives came, but several employees also joined. Some are developers, and though it sounds sloppy, there’s a possibility that the site might be changed by them.”

Venture companies being sloppy is nothing new.

Fundamentally, when taking investments, thorough reviews are necessary.

If that wasn’t done, it was 100% this person’s fault.

“I understand. If you need my help, come anytime. Or I’ll contact you often.”

“Yes, CEO… I’m truly sorry for causing you concern.”

“It’s alright. And…”

Lee Hyun-woo took a deep breath before finally saying what he had been hesitant to voice.

“Actually, we were thinking of acquiring 【Internet Goblin Market】.”

“What? Really?”

“Yes, we were planning to use its twin site, 【Online Headhunter】, as a model for our new employee recruitment. We believe the future of a company will depend on the talent it can attract.”

“Ah… Yes… If only I had known earlier…”

A deep sense of regret was etched on Gu Man-hoe’s face.

As if he would have immediately accepted Lee Hyun-woo’s acquisition proposal instead of making the bad investment.

Seeing this, Lee Hyun-woo gave a bitter smile.

“We were planning to establish it before the next round of recruitment, so we’re in a hurry too. Is there any chance I could meet the investor?”

“He’s not exactly a nice guy, so I’m hesitant to introduce you… Oh? Are you planning to acquire?”

“Yes, that’s right. But if he demands an unreasonable price, we won’t be able to proceed with the acquisition.”

“Well, that’s true… I’ll contact him. I need to negotiate with him anyway.”

Gu Man-hoe showed a determined spirit.

“Poor guy…”

This might just be the beginning.

As the world becomes more ruthless, there will be more people trying to take over well-nurtured companies.
