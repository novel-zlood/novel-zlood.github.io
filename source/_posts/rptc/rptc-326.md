Jeju Airport has been saturated since the 1980s, leading to runway extension and terminal expansion projects.

However, as we moved into the 1990s, the explosive demand for tourists led to further developments.

“These days, it’s starting to get overwhelming.”

It’s as if there’s a distinct period before and after 【Jungle】.

When a global IT company entered Jeju Island, the airport began to overflow.

To address this inconvenience, a new airport has been steadily discussed, and recently, a preliminary feasibility study was conducted.

Upon checking in the middle, I heard that it received high scores for economic feasibility, safety, and environmental factors, so it was decided that construction of the new airport would soon begin.

But now Lee Hyun-woo was even mentioning the harbor.

“Hmm…”

After a brief hum, Goo Chang-mo nodded.

“Airports and harbors have different roles. Understood. I will also push this forward.”

After parting ways with Lee Hyun-woo, he immediately convened a meeting. Then, favorable opinions emerged from all directions.

“Honestly, before 【Jungle】 came, Jeju’s cargo volume was out of the top 10. But what about now? We are proudly ranked 6th, aren’t we?”

“That’s right. At this rate, we can catch up with Busan, Gwangyang, and even Ulsan and Incheon.”

For reference, the ranking of port cargo volume was overwhelmingly led by Busan, followed by Gwangyang.

Then came Ulsan, Incheon, and Pyeongtaek-Dangjin Port. Other ports felt like an insurmountable barrier.

“It’s overwhelming. Up to the 5th rank and below the 6th rank, the positions were different, weren’t they?”

“Yes, but Jeju Port’s cargo volume has been explosively increasing every year, and last year it recorded the same rank as Pyeongtaek-Dangjin Port. And it seems likely to surpass Pyeongtaek-Dangjin Port this year.”

“That’s all because of the delivery innovations led by 【Jungle】 and 【Online Grocery】 in Jeju, isn’t it?”

“Yes, that’s right. The cargo volume is increasing day by day.”

“But Chairman Lee said that he would make Jeju the center of global delivery innovation to the governor. Shouldn’t we wholeheartedly welcome that?”

“Even 【Online Grocery】 came in with that goal. Not just the mainland, but Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and even China. Furthermore, they plan to expand through the Pacific and Indian Oceans, so I think we should assist in these two businesses.”

Ever since 【Jungle】 started pushing for something, the Jeju Provincial Assembly has been unanimous.

Even now, Governor Goo Chang-mo decided to request the construction of a new harbor from the central government based on the unanimous agreement of provincial assembly members.

‘But I wonder if the finances will support it.’

Key industries are funded by the central government’s budget.

If we propose pursuing both the airport and harbor simultaneously, they might show reluctance.

The central government’s financial situation wasn’t particularly good due to the World Cup this year.

Reluctantly, after discussing it with the Jeju National Assembly members,

“Wasn’t Jeju’s tax revenue pretty good last year?”

“I heard it’s even better this year.”

“Does that mean we should provide some support?”

“Yes. You know how long it takes if it goes up to the central government, don’t you? Even the preliminary feasibility study for the new airport has already dragged on for three years.”

“Has it already been three years?”

“Yes, it has been that long. And with the presidential election this year, it will surely be handed over to the next administration.”

“That’s true. Then we should insist on providing support even more. Otherwise, 【Jungle】’s business might be hindered.”

“After talking, it seems like we’re too supportive of 【Jungle】. It’s like we’ve received a request from Lee Hyun-woo.”

“Oh, I’m afraid of such words. Honestly, I’ve never even met Lee Hyun-woo.”

“Me neither. So I’m quite envious of the governor. He visits you directly, but not us.”

“Well, that’s because there are many administrative needs. Anyway, we’ll proceed with both matters immediately.”

After hearing the mixed envy and jealousy from the National Assembly members, Goo Chang-mo quickly changed direction.

There was a mix of suspicion in some people’s eyes.

‘Meeting Chairman Lee Hyun-woo frequently could lead to misunderstandings.’

But he and Lee were really clean.

It’s just that the benefits seen from 【Jungle】 moving to Jeju were enormous, so things were progressing smoothly.

Even now, after listening to the opinions of the provincial assembly and National Assembly members, he was actively appealing to the central government because Jeju could develop more as 【Jungle】 continued to grow.

Of course, Goo Chang-mo also had ambitions befitting a politician.

He was leading Jeju’s development to advance to higher positions, ultimately wanting to move from the island to national governance.

* * *

The government’s response to Jeju’s request accelerated.

And finally, a conclusion was reached starting with the airport.

『Government to begin construction of Jeju’s new airport next year!』

Seeing the article, Lee Hyun-woo smiled with satisfaction.

Reading the content, it stated that Jeju would partially support the national budget for the new airport construction.

Since it was such a massive key industry, a whopping 5 trillion won was expected to be invested, and the fact that Jeju was supporting it meant that much tax revenue was being collected.

‘Well, considering how much we contribute.’

【Jungle】 was one of the companies that paid the most taxes in the country, both to the central and local governments.

This was why large corporations were attracted by provinces and cities.

Perhaps because of this?

Shortly after, the governor of Jeollanam-do sent a direct invitation.

When Lee Hyun-woo, who couldn’t understand the reason, called in Park Do-hoon, information started flowing out.

“I heard that the mayor of Gwangyang contacted the governor of Jeollanam-do. They want to join hands to invite you, Chairman.”

Where does he hear such rumors?

Lee Hyun-woo wondered internally, but Park Do-hoon was in charge of positions made for such matters.

“In fact, Gwangyang is benefiting from Jeju’s increased cargo volume. Gwangyang ranks second in port cargo volume. As a result, many companies that Jeju cannot handle have moved to Gwangyang. For example, if a product has a limited shelf life, wouldn’t it be better to send it from the nearest place to Jeju?”

“That’s right. But how much has it increased?”

“You’ll know when you check it out later, but fisheries, aquaculture, and vegetable farms have significantly increased. Additionally, there are many companies processing and packaging these products. The reason why agriculture and fisheries have developed in a city known for its steel mills is because of what people recently call ‘Junglenomics.’ So the mayor of Gwangyang wants to meet you, but it looks more appropriate for the governor of Jeollanam-do to step in.”

Listening further, it seemed to all fit together.

‘Looks like Jeonnam and Gwangyang reached out to him.’

Otherwise, how would he know such detailed information?

He even mentioned the ambitions of the governor of Jeollanam-do and the mayor of Gwangyang.

“Even if you only attract 【Jungle】’s subcontractors or affiliates, their popularity will skyrocket. So if you go to meet them, they’ll probably beg you to throw something their way?”

Upon hearing this, Lee Hyun-woo chuckled.

‘Well, even if not affiliates, we can set up subcontractors that can’t enter Jeju in Jeonnam.’

Thinking further, logistics warehouses first came to mind.

Moreover, with the recent trend of directly purchasing meat products and agricultural and fishery products, setting up packaging processing companies based on ports seemed like a viable way to facilitate the flow of ingredients between Jeju and Jeollanam-do.

“Sounds good. Let’s make time to go.”

Eventually, Lee Hyun-woo met with the governor of Jeollanam-do shortly after and agreed to build a logistics center in Gwangyang.

Since it was decided to be a super-sized logistics center, the governor of Jeollanam-do’s eyes grew as wide as saucers.

Subsequently, as expected, he briefly met the mayor of Gwangyang.

Upon hearing about the logistics center, the mayor was so shocked that the number of gold teeth in his mouth was almost visible.

After returning to Jeju, the media coverage began.

『【Jungle】, a pioneer of balanced regional development?』

Can the way words are framed make such a difference? Something he hadn’t even considered now seemed like it might actually ease the concentration in the capital area due to 【Jungle】.

In recent years, the influx of population into Jeju itself was from the capital area.

It seemed like this trend would continue, and especially since the logistics center was being built not only in Jeju but also in Jeollanam-do, various industries were abuzz.

Not just rumors, but there was news about the construction of a private expressway connecting Gwangju and Gwangyang.

This expressway, once completed, would cut the current travel time of one hour and twenty minutes by about forty minutes.

Since Gwangju was the most industrially developed area in Jeollanam-do, political and business figures seemed to be making such judgments.

If various products were to gather at the logistics center, the roads needed to be opened first.

Immediately, the real estate market in Gwangyang was in an uproar, with numerous construction companies considering apartment sales in Gwangyang.

Moreover, “Junglenomics” was mentioned once again.

When 【Jungle】 gets involved, people gather, and when people gather, the industrial map changes.

Simultaneously, the related articles and reports poured in, and journalists attributed meaning to Lee Hyun-woo’s otherwise meaningless actions.

The reason for this explosive response was the more advanced internet compared to the past.

『Is Lee Hyun-woo entering the fishing industry?』

How could that be?

‘Ha, I’ve just been eating sashimi more often because it tastes good…’

Though things were getting overblown, Lee Hyun-woo decided to enjoy it.

Thinking back, since moving to Jeju, he realized that things only changed quickly when they were this overblown.

Otherwise, even if the logistics center was built, the lack of surrounding living infrastructure would cause significant inconvenience for the employees.

Therefore, he didn’t provide any explanations for the various things the media attributed meaning to, and instead planned to travel with his wife and son on weekends.

Initially, they traveled around Jeju, and the second time, they visited Gwangyang by boat.

“If we take a plane, we could get there quickly, tch.”

Upon hearing this one remark, someone picked it up and wrote strange news articles.

『Lee Hyun-woo wants a direct flight between Jeju and Jeollanam-do!』

『A direct flight from Jeju to Gwangju in the making?』

『【Korean Air】 considering a direct flight between Jeju and Yeosu』

They were all fake news. However, one of them was close to the truth.

『【Korean Air】 to establish a low-cost carrier (LCC) to increase domestic flights!』

“Oh? The travel and tourism industry is going to explode!”

“Really?”

“Yes, your business will thrive.”

“Is that so? Then should I consider starting a low-cost airline?”

Kim Ah-young’s ambition was even greater than Lee Hyun-woo’s.

Hearing her words, Lee Hyun-woo couldn’t help but laugh.

‘Is the day when I’ll play the role of a shutterman approaching?’
