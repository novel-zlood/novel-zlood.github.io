In [Guseong], what is the probability that the MP3 player will not come out?

It is probably close to zero.

So, it’s not a bad idea to sell the core technology of [Alpha Cast] or take the approach of allowing it to be sold.

In that sense, Lee Hyun-woo introduced a functional cell phone that would eventually come out to Kim Tae-hyun.

“Embedding an MP3 player in a cell phone?”

“Yes, in the future, you’ll be able to do anything with a cell phone, so it seems like a good attempt. Oh, right. Just listen to it once.”

Lee Hyun-woo handed the MP3 player directly to Kim Tae-hyun.

Kim Tae-hyun accepted it with a smirk.

“I honestly don’t need to listen to this.”

“Pardon? Why?”

“I already knew about it.”

“Oh...”

Somehow, Kim Tae-hyun already seemed to know about the MP3 player.

‘Well, that’s how small companies always are.’

Security must be thorough, but it’s not easy to maintain.

In the future, more thorough confidentiality should be requested from Jung Sung-woo of [Alpha Cast].

“To confess one more thing, I also got interested in the place you’re investing in. So, I looked into it through my secretary.”

“Should I be thanking you for being honest?”

“I should be thanking you. It's not easy to tell me about the products of the company you’re nurturing before they’re even released, like you did now.”

Even in this situation, Lee Hyun-woo laughed without being flustered.

At the same time, he asked Kim Tae-hyun.

“Are you going to start preparing?”

“No.”

“Why not?”

“It will come out in the market within a few months. If it sells well, starting then won’t be too late.”

This is what is called a fast-follower strategy.

“Once [Guseong] starts producing, it has to be mass-production, so this first version is like doing market research without spending money. Instead, I will pay for the patent properly. At least [Alpha Cast] won’t starve.”

This means making a living through royalties.

“And I’m going to prepare the MP3 phone you just mentioned right away. Then I have to pay another fee for the core technology, so the president will be happy." 

"In that sense, thank you.”

“No need to thank me. In the end, it will be a win-win for both of us.”

In reality, it’s difficult for small companies to catch up with large companies in a short time.

Instead, if they have core technology like now, they can have a stable income for a long time.

On the contrary, Lee Hyun-woo was smiling inside.

‘The era of MP3 players will come faster.’

The faster it comes, what will happen to the places selling MP3 files?

‘The world I want will come sooner.’

* * *

On the way back, Kim Tae-hyun reflected on Lee Hyun-woo again.

‘He’s a really amazing guy.’

I never imagined he would bring up the MP3 player today.

I thought he would hold back until it sold a lot.

‘He seems to know it’s more foolish to do that.’

It’s true.

When new products come out, those who can deploy economies of scale quickly copy them.

But what happen when affected party files a lawsuit?

If it’s a big company, they might have a chance, but a small company cannot beat [Guseong] in legal battle.

Because they use the most competent lawyers in the country.

Even if the opponent is a big company, legal disputes can be dragged endlessy, which drain money and energy.

Although he knew this wasn’t morally right, it was better than being left behind.

In that sense, Lee Hyun-woo chose most reasonable way to protect [Alpha Cast].

If [Guseong] decides to create the MP3 player phone that Lee Hyun-woo suggested earlier,

‘They’ll have to pay the core technology fee.’

Surely he could have done the embedding of an MP3 player in a phone himself.

‘He handed over the idea and took the smaller but more realistic royalty profit.’

By now, it’s natural to be wary.

After seeing him several times, Lee Hyun-woo’s abilities are beyond expectations.

However, as he said earlier, talking to Lee Hyun-woo is really fun.

In fact, the prince of a leading conglomerate group is lonely.

There wasn’t a single person he could call a close friend.

To such Kim Tae-hyun, the existence of Lee Hyun-woo has recently approached in a very peculiar way.

‘Let’s watch a bit more.’

I still don’t know whether Lee Hyun-woo will continue to be like a friend or change like other chaebol heirs who tried to surpass the prince of [Guseong] in the past.

I think I need to watch more with time.

* * *

Meanwhile, Lee Hyun-woo spent that evening with Kim Ah-young.

He confided to Kim Ah-young about what happened during lunchtime.

“What? Oppa?”

“Yeah. He already knew. He seemed to have investigated me.”

“……”

“Oh, don’t worry. I’m not offended at all. I actually feel a bit sorry for using Tae-hyun hyung’s feelings.”

“Using oppa’s feelings?”

“[Guseong] is bound to make an MP3 player sooner or later. Whether they create it with fair compensation to [Alpha Cast] or using backhanded methods depends on the management of [Guseong]. Don’t you think so?”

Kim Ah-young’s mouth opened wide.

It was undeniable truth in Lee Hyun-woo’s words.

Her face flushed slightly.

If [Guseong] had always been upright, it wouldn’t be embarrassing, but they had often done what Lee Hyun-woo mentioned.

“It’s embarrassing.”

“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. You didn’t do it. And most companies have grown that way. I hope the day will come when copyrights and patents are protected, but that day is not today.”

“You sound like you’re from the future.”

“Do I? Haha.”

Lee Hyun-woo laughed a few times as if he were from the future.

However.

“Who knows. Maybe I have really lived in the future then reborn.”

“Then tell me about my future.”

Even if he reveals the truth, the other party always take it lightly.

“Well, what do you want to know?”

“Who I’ll date, who I’ll marry, and how I’ll live.”

“You make me sound like a fortune teller.”

“I’ll pay you generously.”

“You’ll date a good man, marry a good husband, and live happily.”

There’s no need to tell the full truth.

After all, Kim Ah-young’s future might change in this life.

“You must want a generous payment. You’re saying only good things.”

“No need for payment. I just sincerely wish you that kind of life.”

For a moment, Kim Ah-young’s heart fluttered at Lee Hyun-woo’s words.

The words she had in her heart kept lingering.

‘I feel like I can live like that with you.’

However, she made eye contact with secretary Park Min-sook sitting across from her.

Park Min-sook’s words echoed in her head.

- Maintain your dignity and value.

Although she didn’t fully understand why she had to keep it, she decided to accept her words for now.

She held back and returned to the original topic.

“I don’t know if I have the authority, but I’ll try to ensure our company will use other companies’ copyrights and patents properly in the future.”

Hearing that, Lee Hyun-woo just smiled.

‘That’s not an easy task.’

Honestly, even Lee Hyun-woo finds it hard to confidently say he himself won’t infringe on others’ work in the future.

For someone who has already lived in the future, everything was a resource.

There would probably be potential violations everywhere.

Whether to attempt something based on ideas that came from others.

‘Honestly, there’s no clear answer.’

Rationalizing endlessly or feeling endless guilt about stealing others’ core technologies.

So, decide each time.

Don’t approach it too rigidly.

* * *

Two days later.

On the plane departing from Jeju Island, Lee Hyun-woo sat next to Kim Ah-young again.

It was fun during the trip, and he could feel that Kim Ah-young was adjusting to him moment by moment.

By now, even Lee Hyun-woo, who has no clue about women, couldn’t miss the other’s feelings.

Then what about Lee Hyun-woo’s feelings?

‘I don’t dislike her.’

No, he surely started to have feelings for her.

The problem was that [Guseong Group] was not an easy place.

What if the media, which keeps focusing on Lee Hyun-woo’s fame, notices that he often meets Kim Ah-young?

‘Wouldn’t it be troublesome for both sides?’

Last time, when a scandal with Kim Yun-sun broke out, it was incredibly annoying for Lee Hyun-woo.

So, he thought it would be better to be a bit cautious now.

And when he got off the plane and was returning home, he kept repeating to himself.

Let’s set the relationship with Kim Ah-young a bit above that of a female friend.

However, Lee Jung-woo, sitting in the passenger seat, asked.

“Hyung, is something happening with Kim Ah-young?”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean, not business, but in terms of a man-woman relationship.”

“Well, I’m not sure.”

“Oh? The way you’re saying it, something must be happening.”

“Take it literally. Not sure means I’m really not sure.”

“Then should I tell you?”

“What do you know?”

“At least one thing. That Kim Ah-young has feelings for you.”

“Never mind, take care of your own business. And we don’t have time for this. As revealed in this workshop, there are many tasks we need to start next year.”

Perhaps the conversation about men and women felt awkward, so Lee Hyun-woo subtly changed the topic.

Fortunately, his brother played along well.

“That’s right. The schedules for Japan, the U.S., and Germany are confirmed, and as you mentioned, it’s better to expand to Taiwan and Hong Kong as well.”

“The best business strategy is to dominate the market simultaneously before others do.”

In Japan, good news is expected soon regarding portal sites and online shopping.

In the U.S., there are plans to collaborate with [AltaVist] and participate in the [Stanford University] forum, with Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo handling the schedule and assessing market entry.

In Germany, Woo Sang-won and Jang Yoo-chul will attend the [Dachshund Institute] forum and also visit another German research institute, [Front Hoff Institute], that developed MPEG.

This was to preemptively prevent obstacles when MP3 technology enters the global market in the future.

These were the topics discussed at the workshop, but Lee Hyun-woo raised another issue.

It was to knock on the doors of Hong Kong and Taiwan, where IT infrastructure is well-established.

Dream big, but Lee Hyun-woo’s vision was so large that it seemed to make Lee Jung-woo tremble.

“It’s strange. New Year’s Day is just around the corner, but I’m already looking forward to next year. Korea to the world, the world to Korea.”

“Cringe, stop it.”

“Oh...”

Lee Hyun-woo stopped his brother, who was reciting catchphrases.

But in his heart, he was repeating an even cringier slogan.

‘Jungle to the world, the world to Jungle.’

Of course, the Jungle here referred to Lee Hyun-woo’s [Jungle].
