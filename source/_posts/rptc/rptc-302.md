The Day of the Presentation.

Lee Hyun-woo and his party sat in seats with a good view of the stage, watching the appearance of Steven Job.

Immediately, applause and cheers rang in their ears.

Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

There weren't many people here who weren't fans of his.

Even Lee Hyun-woo was enjoying the atmosphere, recalling Steven Job from his previous life.

Honestly, the methods Lee Hyun-woo applied most while running his company were already implemented and verified by large American IT companies.

It would be a lie to say he didn't mimic the methods of 【Pineapple】, which was at the peak. Naturally, Steven Job was a sort of role model for Lee Hyun-woo.

However, it was not the current Steven Job, but the one from his previous life that served as a model.

‘So grow quickly into the Steven Job from back then!’

Thinking this to himself, he opened his ears wide.

Then Steven Job's voice came through.

“It’s been over a year since I, along with the top management, joined 【Pineapple】. During that time, we created the portal site 【Ocean】, and quickly took away the market share dominated by 【Yaho】 and 【Jungle】. Ah, I apologize for saying this in front of Hyun-woo Lee and Jamie Wang sitting over there.”

“Hahaha.”

“Hahaha.”

When Steven Job pointed to Lee Hyun-woo and Jamie Wang, people burst into laughter.

Though he mixed in humor, Lee Hyun-woo couldn't help but laugh at how Steven Job was effectively promoting himself.

‘I need to learn that, too.’

He needed to be as shameless as Steven Job.

If he only displayed the unique scholarly temperament of Koreans, it wouldn't be possible to imprint 【Jungle】 and Lee Hyun-woo on the world.

Is that so important? Aren’t you advocating for work-life balance?

If someone were to question Lee Hyun-woo's thoughts, he would immediately respond.

‘That's why it's important. By imprinting 【Jungle】 and Lee Hyun-woo, I can prove my way is right, and our unique work-life balance culture can have an impact.’

For a moment, when his stream of consciousness passed, Steven Job was already introducing the product.

Of course, he hadn't missed what Steven Job said in the meantime.

Cruelly, he even showed charts to highlight how much 【Pineapple】 had struggled before he returned, criticizing the previous management.

He even committed the atrocity of repeatedly calling it ‘the worst.’

This was to make the products he would introduce next stand out even more.

“CEOs of computer manufacturers sitting here, you might be thankful for Windows 97 released late last year. That operating system caused a surge in computer demand. Ah, mentioning this, Bill Kates sitting over there seems to be managing his expression. Come on, friend, you can chuckle! Why? Because from now on, you need to be nervous. Yes, everyone. Our 【Pineapple】 has finally designed a new type of operating system and computer that will surprise the world.”

His voice was filled with passion.

And that passion was shouting to the people.

- I really enjoy this work! I love it so much that I made a new computer and operating system! This will surely change the world! Why? Because this computer is not just a product, but a dream for people.

Steven Job indeed described the product with the word "dream."

“a-Mach, this is your dream! A dream you want to buy, a dream you want to type on, a dream you want to connect to the internet! Yes, this all-in-one computer is!”

At this moment, the screen changed to show the appearance of a-Mach.

It was hard for Lee Hyun-woo to compare since he hadn't seen it directly in his previous life, but one thing was certain: he felt that it was similar to the dream computer Steven Job described.

‘It’s really beautifully designed.’

It was a masterpiece emphasizing Steven Job's design.

It might even be more captivating than the a-Mach from his previous life.

Lee Hyun-woo had underestimated Steven Job until now.

It seemed so because he had been comparing him to Steven Job at his peak in the previous life.

But, looking back, Steven Job.

‘Isn’t he starting off better than in his previous life?’

In the previous life, he hadn't started a portal site.

But in this life, he had already made a grand comeback through the portal site 【Ocean】, and the a-Mach born after that had such a neat appearance that even Lee Hyun-woo felt like buying it.

People in the hall were also buzzing.

“The monitor and the main body are attached?”

“Is that possible?”

“How much is it?”

At that moment, as if reading people's minds, Steven Job raised his voice again.

“There’s no problem with functionality because the monitor and the main body are attached. No, a-Mach has better specifications than any other computer. Actually, I sometimes couldn’t understand. Why sell the main body and monitor separately? Not only that, but also the mouse, keyboard, and operating system? But later I found out the reason. It’s a clever trick to avoid revealing the high price. If you separate them, the price of one item has to be cheap. Of course, some computers can offer everything at an economical price, but they will break down soon. Not a-Mach. It has everything in one computer. Even the wires are neat! Instead, it seems expensive! But everyone, will you buy a-Mach cheaply when investing in your dream? A Bench car can’t be cheap, right?”

Steven Job raised the value of a-Mach by even mentioning the famous German luxury car, Bench.

The hall buzzed again, and people were completely immersed in his presentation.

Lee Hyun-woo was no exception.

However, he wasn't just immersed without any thoughts.

‘Wow, amazing. I must do a presentation like that someday.’

He decided to learn and absorb what he could, and put all his effort into the product explanation that would come someday.

Above all, his heart was pounding.

It felt like a hidden rival had suddenly appeared, making the future seem exciting.

After the presentation ended, this feeling grew stronger.

‘I need to meet him quickly.’

The reason his steps quickened as he left the presentation hall was because he wanted to meet Steven Job.

Even though it would take several more hours for Steven Job to perfectly finish the event and come.

Should he be thankful?

Due to immense traffic congestion, the time to reach the meeting place was significantly delayed.

In the meantime, his mind became much calmer.

‘Come to think of it, even if a rival appears, 【Pineapple】 is not our match yet.’

If 【Pineapple】 continued to produce hits like a-Mach, a-Pot, and a-Phone, it seemed they would grow to the size of 【Jungle】.

However, since 【Jungle】 would not remain idle, by the time Steven Job truly emerged as a rival, Lee Hyun-woo’s retirement might be waiting.

‘That’s highly probable.’

In fact, for 【Jungle】 and 【Pineapple】 to compete, the product lines had to be the same.

Lee Hyun-woo had no intention of making computers or MP3 players, so they could only clash over mobile operating systems later.

‘Ugh, it’s a shame.’

It seemed Lee Hyun-woo wanted to compete with the legend from his previous life.

Unconsciously, a hint of regret appeared on his face.

But it was only for a moment.

A few hours later, at the meeting with Steven Job, he sensed that the competition in this life would be brought forward.

* * *

To be precise, not only Steven Job came to this meeting, but Bill Kates also joined.

Seeing him, Steven Job first sneered.

“Isn’t this place supposed to be for CEOs only? I don’t know why someone who has stepped away from management is here.”

“I’m busy too, you know? I came because I was called. And shouldn’t you be trying to get on the good side of a director who holds a huge stake in that small company you’re bragging about?”

“Whoa, whoa, why are you two growling at each other as soon as you meet? The person who arranged this meeting is feeling embarrassed.”

Lee Hyun-woo, showing no signs of being intimidated by the two, quickly intervened.

He then said,

“Strictly speaking, Steven also stepped down from his position and returned, didn’t he? So, Bill should be given a chance too.”

“Hmph, I have no intention of returning as CEO.”

“Of course, because you’re afraid of me.”

“Whoa, whoa, stop it... Eh, whatever. You two just keep fighting.”

Although they hadn’t met many times, the two seemed comfortable around Lee Hyun-woo.

They were revealing their blatant emotions in front of him.

In fact, Lee Hyun-woo knew well why the two didn’t get along.

They had always been rivals, but he had recently read an article about a big fight over the joint development of a search engine.

As a result, they each went their separate ways, developing their own search engines.

Lee Hyun-woo pinpointed this.

“Since you two don’t get along, the market share of our 【Jungle】’s search engine is increasing day by day. Not only that, but the accuracy of our search results is also the best. Please don’t get along and keep fighting. So that the search engine and portal site can be dominated by 【Jungle】.”

“Ugh…”

“You’re really annoying, you know that?”

“Hahaha.”

“Don’t laugh, it makes me like you.”

The more comfortable they were, the closer they felt.

But it only took a few seconds for Lee Hyun-woo’s smile to fade.

“And don’t be too complacent. Though it will take time for portals and search engines, the e-book reader market won’t let 【Jungle】 have a head start.”

“……!”

“……!”

At Steven Job's mention of an e-book reader, not only Lee Hyun-woo but also Bill Kates was surprised.

“Are you planning to make an e-book reader?”

“Why would 【Pineapple】 need to?”

“Why? Can’t you see from 【Jungle】’s involvement? The e-book reader market will soon open wide.”

“What?”

Bill Kates’ face hardened as he looked at both Steven Job and Lee Hyun-woo.

He had already heard news that 【Jungle】 was making an e-book reader.

He thought there must be a strategy behind it, but hadn't considered jumping in like Steven Job.

But now that even 【Pineapple】 was entering the e-book reader market, he couldn’t help but ponder.

“Hey, Bill, I know what you’re thinking, but that’s not your decision to make. You’re not even a CEO, right?”

“I got it!”

“Whoa, you scared me!”

Steven Job was startled when Bill Kates suddenly shouted.

“What did you get?”

“The reason both of you are entering the e-book reader market!”

“What is it?”

“Operating system… that’s it. You two are dreaming of a new operating system market, not for computers!”

At his words, both Steven Job and Lee Hyun-woo were surprised.

Because it was spot on.

‘He’s really not to be underestimated.’

‘Bill Kates is still sharp.’
