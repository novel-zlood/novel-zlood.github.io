'By the way, if 【Space War】 succeeds, the number of PC bangs (internet cafes) will increase dramatically.'

Currently, non-PC bang internet cafes are steadily increasing in number.

With the ability to drink coffee and use the internet, they have been featured several times as dating spots for couples.

This has led to a surge in startups, resulting in dozens of new cafes popping up in Seoul.

'If 【Space War】 becomes a hit, it will likely usher in a golden age for PC bangs, not just internet cafes.'

Lee Hyun-woo let his imagination run wild.

If the number of PC bangs increases, naturally, the demand for budget computers will rise.

Assuming each PC bang starts with about 50 units, as large-scale PC bangs won't appear immediately.

'We'll easily surpass 10,000 within 1-2 years.'

That means 500,000 computers will be needed.

He quickly picked up the phone and contacted Kim Yoon-soo.

"Hyung."

(Oh, yeah.)

"How many computers can you produce in a year these days?"

(Huh? Why are you suddenly asking about that?)

"I think the demand for computers is going to spike soon."

(Ah, it's because of Windows 97? They're really selling well these days.)

Whenever a new version of Windows was released, PC sales tended to increase.

Naturally, Windows 97 had been released at the end of last year, and recently, PC companies were reportedly seeing a surge in sales.

"That's part of it, but I think our company will be releasing a very exciting game soon."

(Huh? A game?)

"Yes, a PC game that could significantly increase the number of budget computers."

In other words, the upcoming release of 【Space War】, combined with the favorable conditions brought by Windows 97, could lead to record-breaking production of budget computers, so he subtly hinted to Kim Yoon-soo to prepare in advance.

(Really? That's great news. We're about to start mass production at our factory in China next month.)

"Wow... The timing is perfect."

(Thanks to you. You told me early on that Windows 97 would be coming out, so we accelerated our production plans in China and increased the scale.)

Come to think of it, it was Lee Hyun-woo who had informed Kim Yoon-soo about Windows 97 as soon as he heard it from Son Jung-yi.

At the time, Kim Yoon-soo, who was planning production in China, must have made a bolder decision after hearing that information.

(We can produce 300,000 units a year in both Korea and China.)

"That's great. You're going to be rich. Hahaha."

(Ah, that would only happen if they all sell.)

"They will. Don't worry."

(Seeing CEO Lee so confident makes me even more excited.)

Kim Yoon-soo was someone who would believe Lee Hyun-woo if he said he could make soy sauce out of red beans.

He was confident as well.

'PC bangs will definitely pop up and grow significantly in our country.'

Until then, 【One Computer】, focusing on budget PCs, would continue to grow.

Seeing those around him succeed made Lee Hyun-woo happy.

A smile naturally formed on his lips.

* * *

The next day, a smile was still on Lee Hyun-woo's face.

The reason was simple.

The data center had been completed.

Naturally, he left for Gwacheon early in the morning and met Kim Tae-hyun at the entrance.

Although he had visited a few times during construction, entering after it was perfectly completed brought new emotions.

'Finally, the era of the data center is dawning.'

Having advanced much further than in his previous life, the development speed of information and communication in this life was unpredictable.

However, one thing was certain.

This data center would undoubtedly boost the stock prices of both 【Jungle】 and 【Guseong Electronics】.

"As I mentioned before, this is the reception desk. It needs to be manned by a beautiful female employee."

"Hyung, you're too much..."

"I'm kidding, kidding. Let me continue the explanation."

"Why don't you do it in English?"

"In English?"

"Yes, Jamie Wang is coming the day after tomorrow, so it's for me to practice."

"Ah, right, right. That's a good idea."

From this point, Kim Tae-hyun started explaining in English.

"This is the security checkpoint. Once you've applied for access and received approval from the person in charge, you place your belongings that can pass through the security checkpoint here. Devices with storage media, like laptops, will be filtered out here."

Mentioning laptops already might seem premature,

'But they say over 10,000 have been sold recently...'

Considering the upcoming era of laptops, managing them through the security checkpoint was not a bad idea.

"Phones with cameras must have tape over the lens. Otherwise, they need to be checked in before entry."

"Hyung, you're too detailed."

"Oh, really?"

"I understand the emphasis on security, but I'm more interested in the facilities and functions. Jamie Wang will probably feel the same."

"Okay, got it."

Following Lee Hyun-woo's advice, Kim Tae-hyun shifted his explanation to focus on the facilities and functions.

Occasionally, Lee Hyun-woo would interject with questions.

"I feel heat as soon as we start the test run?"

"It's because you came from outside. In reality, the temperature and humidity are kept constant."

Seeing Kim Tae-hyun explain without hesitation to any question brought a smile to Lee Hyun-woo's face.

When all the explanations were finished, he clapped vigorously.

"Wow, this is really impressive. I'm satisfied."

"Of course. You've practically gotten the data center for free."

"Yes, thank you."

Sellers often claim they're at a loss, but this time, it was almost true.

"Think of it as an investment. Instead, make sure to secure Jamie Wang and Son Jung-yi as clients."

"I'm sure that will happen."

* * *

Two days later, Jamie Wang arrived.

After spending a night in Seoul, he came to see Lee Hyun-woo.

For some reason, Jamie Wang's expression looked very good, which hadn't been the case for a while.

He started by mentioning 【Jungle】's recent activities, but it seemed like there was something more.

"I didn't expect Go and Omok to be so popular. I heard they're doing well in Japan, and they're also being serviced in Taiwan and Hong Kong?"

"Yes, they were launched recently."

Eventually, when entering China, 【Jungle Games】 aimed to quickly establish a foothold.

At this point, Jamie Wang brought up his plans.

"So, have you ever thought about console games?"

"No, that's not our area. But why do you ask?"

"Our company, 【Yaho】, is considering entering that field."

"Really?"

"Actually, after many discussions with the CEO, the idea of a platform came up. When you think about it, isn't a console game also a type of platform?"

"Well... of course."

Jamie Wang's mention of console games took Lee Hyun-woo by surprise, causing him to stutter slightly.

Originally, console games were dominated by Japan.

That changed drastically in his previous life with the entry of 【Macro Soft】.

Billie Gates wanted to make Windows a powerful gaming platform.

It was called the Living Room Entertainment Hub Project.

"Originally, I planned this trip to discuss 【Yaho】's entry into China, but seeing 【Jungle】's recent foray into games made me change direction. I want to understand the console game markets in Korea and China. So, I'll visit those two places and then meet with the president of 【Sonic】 in Japan."

"Ah, yes... But currently, Korea is a graveyard for console games."

"That's the case now, but who knows what the future holds?"

Lee Hyun-woo nodded after thinking for a while.

In his previous life, this person was right.

In the future, console games would gain traction in Korea.

What piqued his curiosity was the plan to meet with the president of 【Sonic】.

In his past life, despite several proposals from Billie Gates, 【Sonic】 had refused to cooperate.

Especially famous was the rejection of the suggestion to use 【Macro Soft】's programming tools.

【Sonic】 was a company that did not want to share its console game platform.

'Are they perhaps trying to enter through technological partnerships?'

It seemed like a tough road to take.

But if 【Yaho】 was to venture into console games, Lee Hyun-woo could also aim for something.

'Maybe I could suggest our programming tools later?'

Why did Billie Gates propose 【Sonic】 to use 【Macro Soft】's programming tools?

Obviously, to increase the market share of 【Macro Soft】's programming language in the console game development field.

Since some time ago, Lee Hyun-woo set a goal to surpass 【Macro Soft】 and studied it deeply, gaining deeper insights along the way.

Initially, he thought winning in operating systems and web browsers would be enough, but he realized long-term victory required winning the battle of programming languages.

Therefore, he had been supporting and expecting much from Woo Sang-won's programming language development project.

"By the way, do you think 【Sonic】 will agree to a technological partnership?"

"It won't be easy. Ultimately, money will be the key issue."

"I think differently."

"Excuse me?"

"I don't think money will secure a technological partnership with 【Sonic】. It's more likely to work if you acquire or approach other companies."

"Other companies?"

"【Sonic】 isn't the only company making console games."

"Are you talking about 【Ninentendo】?"

"No. That company is even more closed off, making a partnership more difficult. Originally, 【Sonic】 tried to partner with 【Ninentendo】 but failed, leading them to develop their own."

This implied that 【Yaho】 was also likely to fail in a technological partnership with Sony and would pursue independent development.

Lee Hyun-woo rarely poured cold water on someone's plans, but this time he had a reason to mention it in advance.

"As you know, Japan has many console game manufacturers. Excluding those two, some are in decline... No, because they are declining, you might be able to acquire them for a reasonable price."

He suggested that when Jamie Wang goes to Japan, he should consider acquiring a suitable console game company.

"Ah, I realize I might have overstepped."

"No, I understand your sincere intention to help me."

Jamie Wang didn't take Lee Hyun-woo's advice lightly.

He knew Lee Hyun-woo was always sincere.

"Yes, it is sincere. And hearing about console games made me a bit greedy."

"Greedy?"

"Yes. If 【Yaho】 enters console games, maybe our company could develop programming tools for console games... It's a bit of an ambitious thought. Hahaha."

Upon hearing that, Jamie Wang's small eyes widened.

'This person is always so straightforward.'

Reflecting on the conversations he'd had since meeting Lee Hyun-woo,

Every time they met, Lee Hyun-woo openly shared his future plans.

Even though they were in a collaborative competition, it was something that couldn't be done without trust and confidence.

That's why Jamie Wang revealed his plans for entering the console game market.

'If Hyun-woo Lee and 【Jungle】 get involved, they will certainly create a new market.'

Perhaps Jamie Wang's subconscious was hoping for 【Jungle】's participation.

Ultimately, that subconscious desire surfaced, prompting him to say,

"Then, we'll definitely enter the console game market, so please develop the best game programming tools at 【Jungle】."
