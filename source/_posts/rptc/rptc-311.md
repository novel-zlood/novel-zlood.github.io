Lee Hyun-woo, who returned from his honeymoon after taking a generous break through Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

His full-fledged life at the Jeju headquarters has begun.

The building that 【Jungle Holdings】 newly moved into was a 10-story building.

Additionally, 【Jungle Contents】 and 【Jungle Data】 each settled in their own 10-story buildings.

All three places were leased, and they would have to stay there until they could move into the 【Jungle World】, which was expected to be completed in two years.

“It’s nice because it’s quiet.”

“I also like it because it’s peaceful.”

Min-woo Oh and Yoo-cheol Jang, who arrived earlier than Lee Hyun-woo, had already experienced the atmosphere here and informed him.

It seemed like they were deliberately talking only about the positive aspects, but in the end, the only things they mentioned were that it was quiet and peaceful.

The two words essentially meant the same thing.

‘In other words, it’s inconvenient.’

At times like this, you have to dream together.

“Have I mentioned it before? Silicon Beach?”

“Oh, yes, I’ve heard about it.”

“Me too.”

“Now that we’re here, we should start, right?”

When he mentioned Silicon Beach, a hint of anticipation appeared on their faces.

“Indeed, the government recently announced it. They’re planning to create a national industrial complex in Jeju.”

“It’s not just any national industrial complex. They said it would be an advanced science and technology complex.”

What they said was true.

The government and Jeju were planning to attract large-scale information and communication companies, as well as public and private research institutes, to Wolpyeong-dong.

“Really? Then I’ll have to meet the governor.”

Lee Hyun-woo, who had cut himself off from the world during his honeymoon, was hearing this for the first time.

It seemed that the efforts so far, especially setting up his newlywed home in Jeju and officially relocating two companies, including the holding company, had earned the trust of the government and local authorities.

If Lee Hyun-woo took the initiative to continuously meet with the governor or members of the National Assembly and invite people from public institutions and other companies, the goal of Silicon Beach might be achieved sooner than expected.

In fact, during a meeting with the governor of Jeju through Kang Dong-ho, Lee Hyun-woo mentioned that term.

* * *

“Silicon Beach?”

The governor of Jeju, Goo Chang-mo, was relatively young for a local government head, being in his late 40s.

Naturally, he couldn’t help but be intrigued by the term Silicon Beach, similar to Silicon Valley.

“Yes, that’s right. I’ve been to Silicon Valley, and I believe Jeju can create an advanced industrial complex of that scale.”

“Hahaha…”

“And I liked that it wouldn’t significantly harm the environment. After all, you’re planning to attract information and communication companies and research institutes, aren’t you?”

“Of course.”

“In that case, I will help you attract domestic and foreign companies.”

“Even foreign companies?”

“There’s no reason we can’t. However, they won’t just settle here without any conditions. The infrastructure needs to be adequately prepared so that they find it attractive. I think you should promise that part.”

“Of course. I’ll do that. But specifically, which foreign companies are you thinking of attracting…”

“I’ll contact them soon and let you know.”

“Ah, yes, I understand.”

Goo Chang-mo’s voice began to tremble with excitement. It was a sign that his expectations were rising.

To meet those expectations, Lee Hyun-woo thought he must attract at least one well-known company.

However,

‘It’s not easy to persuade them since nothing is set up here yet.’

The companies that the head of 【Jungle】 considered prestigious were certainly not small.

At the very least, they had to be well-known companies in the information and communication industry.

Even better would be companies known not just in that industry, but to the general public as well, like 【Macro Soft】 or 【Yaho】.

‘How about Steven Job’s 【Pineapple】?’

Though not as big as the other two, it was the top of the top in terms of growth potential.

Since these three companies came to mind first, he contacted Jamie Wang of 【Yaho】 first, in order of closeness.

“Hello?”

(Hello? Oh, hi!)

“You recognize my voice right away.”

(Of course. Hahaha. Oh, congratulations on your wedding, even though it’s late.)

“Thank you for the congratulations, again.”

Jamie Wang had already congratulated him before the wedding.

In fact, he had discouraged him from coming because it felt burdensome.

This applied not just to Jamie Wang but to all his acquaintances abroad.

Anyway, after talking with Jamie Wang about married life and other things for a while, he gradually got to the main point.

“The truth is, I have a purpose for this call.”

(What is it…)

“We’ve moved our headquarters to Jeju.”

(Ah, yes, I read about it. It was even in the news here.)

That was unexpected. It seemed there were quite a few American journalists interested in his affairs.

“I see.”

(But why did you move to an island instead of staying in Seoul?)

“Why do you think? I thought we’d come up with more brilliant ideas working in a peaceful place rather than a city. Hahaha.”

(Should I be excited? You already create ideas and products that amaze the world...)

“Now that I’m here, it’s no joke. I’m already enthusiastic and running around like a madman. But when I see the natural scenery and clear skies here, I don’t feel tired.”

(Wow, I’m jealous.)

“If you have time, you should come. I’ll treat you generously.”

(I should. I actually have a reason to visit Korea regarding a data center issue, so I’ll have to set a date. But was this invitation the reason you called?)

“No. I’ve almost said it all already. The reason I boasted about the natural environment here is that I want to recommend setting up a 【Yaho】 research center here.”

(A research center... I always thought, do you somehow know all my plans?)

“Oh? Were you planning to set up a research center in Korea?”

(Yes, that’s right.)

It would be strange if they weren’t.

Famous IT companies typically establish research centers in countries where IT is advanced to secure talent.

‘Come to think of it, it’s about time we set up a research center abroad too.’

Deciding to push that later, Lee Hyun-woo continued to press his case with Jamie Wang.

“In that case, please do visit Jeju. I hope we can develop a cooperative competitive relationship into a collaborative one while helping each other out here.”

(Haha, a collaborative competitive relationship? That doesn’t sound bad. Okay, I’ll definitely visit when I come to Korea.)

Having hooked one person, Lee Hyun-woo immediately found Steven Job’s phone number and called him.

“It’s me.”

(Oh? Hyun-woo Lee?)

“Do you think about me day and night? You recognized me right away.”

(Hahaha, maybe. After all, our competitor is always 【Jungle】.)

“Come on, what are you saying? 【Pineapple】 still has a long way to go to catch up with us.”

(Hey, haven’t you seen the news lately? The a-Mach we released recently is doing really well.)

“You should talk about the same field. Speaking of which, you mentioned you were preparing an e-book reader, but there’s been no news.”

It was understandable. A perfectionist like Steven Job would have killed the developers twice over with countless rejections during development.

(Don’t worry about that, just wait. But why did you call? To mess with my head?)

“Why would I? Have you ever lost anything because of me? Think about it. You’ve benefited a lot from me.”

(I don’t know, I can’t remember...)

“Wow, you’re playing dumb. Didn’t I practically promote the a-Mach for you when I went to the US? I told the reporters how the era of integrated computers had arrived. Plus, you made the most profit in the stock exchange.”

Lee Hyun-woo’s words were true.

During the 1:1:1 stock exchange in the US, experts evaluated that the company that suffered the most was 【Macro Soft】, while the one that benefited the most was 【Pineapple】.

“Next week, 【Jungle】 will start subscriptions in Korea. We’re already expecting a record high, so you’ve already made money.”

Feeding him the facts, the reaction weakened.

(So, did you call to boast?)

“No. To invite you.”

(In... invite?)

“Our company has relocated to Jeju, Korea. Come and take a look, enjoy some sightseeing. Above all, the nature and atmosphere here are incredible and will help with your meditation.”

The reason for specifically mentioning meditation was due to Steven Job’s past.

Previously, when he worked at a game company called 【Altai】, Steven Job disappeared for two years.

The reason was for meditation.

After a long period of training in India, he returned to the US and released groundbreaking innovative products. People around him often said that geniuses and eccentrics were different.

(Hey, I don’t go that far anymore.)

“Anyway, please come. I even put all my work aside to attend the a-Mach presentation in San Francisco. Come and at least congratulate us.”

(Kk, alright. Alright.)

“By the way, Jamie Wang is also coming.”

(Why is that guy coming?)

“He’s looking into research centers. You know there are many IT talents in Korea.”

(Hmm...)

The temptation seemed to work, as a thoughtful hum could be heard.

“I’ll also contact Billy Kates.”

(What?)

“I have to give everyone a fair chance.”

(...)

Although there was no response, it was clear he was contemplating.

The innovations 【Jungle】 had shown were enough to shake Steven Job’s mind.

Lee Hyun-woo wrapped it up there and actually talked to Billy Kates.

He mentioned that Jamie Wang and Steven Job were considering setting up research centers in Jeju, and although Billy Kates didn’t give a definite answer, he promised to visit once.

‘Alright, whether it works out or not, if I spread the bait like this, at least a few companies will be attracted by their names.’

* * *

The next day, Lee Hyun-woo met with Jeju Governor Goo Chang-mo again and mentioned the three names.

“Jamie Wang, Steven Job, and Billy Kates will visit Jeju.”

“What? Is that really true?”

Goo Chang-mo’s pupils dilated.

“Of course. Why would I lie?”

“Are you saying those people might even set up research centers in Silicon Beach?”

The industrial complex originally planned by the government and Jeju had the term advanced science attached to it.

But after Lee Hyun-woo named it Silicon Beach the previous day, Goo Chang-mo immediately used that term.

“That depends on you, Governor. I said I would help attract them, but I’m not in a position to make it happen.”

“Ah, yes...”

Goo Chang-mo’s expression became interesting. It seemed to be a mix of pressure and responsibility.

So, Lee Hyun-woo decided to give him some points of attack.

“The most proactive person is Jamie Wang, followed by Steven Job. Lastly, Billy Kates is the toughest. But I’d like to say that if you succeed with one of these three, the chances of attracting all of them as a package increase significantly.”
