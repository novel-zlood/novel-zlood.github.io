The plan to create a portal site and further occupy the future of wealth and business.

This led to the strategy of preempting the path where super talents would emerge by hitting PC communication.

Lee Hyun-woo did not bother to expose the scenarios in his head to his subordinates.

“Work should be simple.”

If thoughts become complicated, efficiency does not increase.

The first goal now is to stabilize email.

Through that, they will be able to check how much users are increasing.

And users who increase through the online shopping site will directly turn into purchasing customers.

Moreover, recently 【Jungle】 has been evolving into a platform for selling music albums.

So, he asked again today.

“Han Se-jin, when did you say Candy Boy’s debut was?”

“In two weeks.”

“Okay, Jang Yoo-chul, start displaying the event window and send out a mass email. Announce that we will exclusively sell Candy Boy’s first album.”

“Yes, understood.”

The temporary exclusive sale was the result of Han Se-jin’s negotiation with Candy Boy’s agency, MS Entertainment.

Even though it was just about a week, starting the exclusive sale would clearly prove 【Jungle】’s position in the music market.

If such exclusive sales are repeated, consumers will think that new albums come out first on 【Jungle】.

“Then naturally, they will visit our site to find new albums, right?”

Drawing such a future, he unconsciously hummed a tune.

“Actually, I was preparing for our meeting today….”

Then he suddenly realized and looked around.

He had sung too many parts of a song that no one had heard yet.

Fortunately, no one seemed to pay attention to him.

“Phew, I need to be careful.”

Lee Hyun-woo smiled as he watched people working hard.

“Those who work hard deserve to enjoy too.”

Thinking that it was about time to give them some joy, Lee Hyun-woo opened his mouth to speak.

“We’re going to have a company dinner after work today.”

“A company dinner?”

“Again?”

“Didn’t we have one last week?”

“We had one the week before too, to welcome new employees.”

“Why do we have company dinners so often?”

“If you don’t like it, you don’t have to attend. It’s not mandatory anyway.”

“I’m not the type to miss out on drinking and dancing.”

“I’ll attend thinking it’s the last company dinner before I return to school.”

The person who shouted this loudly at the end was Lee Jung-woo, who had recently been promoted to development team leader.

He heard his once model-student brother’s excited voice once again.

“Tonight, we’re going to a nightclub.”

“Wow!”

“This is awesome!”

“A nightclub!”

“This makes me want to work harder!”

“Then let’s work hard and have fun later!”

“Yes, CEO!”

Lee Jung-woo couldn’t help but shake his head as he watched his brother gradually break away from his past self.

“Is this really the brother I know? Or has he always been this way and only now his playful side is showing?”

He lost count of how many times he had asked himself this question.

This was proof of how new his brother’s changed appearance was to him.

Also, this thought wasn’t negative.

“I’m glad I joined 【Jungle】.”

“Right. It makes work enjoyable.”

When the workplace is enjoyable, work efficiency comes alive.

These people didn’t move sluggishly like they were diluted in alcohol or water.

Because his brother didn’t let them be that way.

This was also one of his brother’s impressive skills.

“I don’t know how he handles people so well.”

* * *

However, that night.

“Your brother’s hands and feet are moving separately.”

Lee Jung-woo chuckled at Jang Yoo-chul’s words.

“Right. That’s the same as showing off his model-student side.”

Seeing Lee Hyun-woo dance, he was definitely not a good dancer.

In a word, he was a stiff wooden log.

Did he himself feel that?

“Wow, dancing is really hard.”

“Is there something you find difficult?”

“My brother has no talent for drinking and dancing.”

“That’s true. He’s been trying to pick up a hobby lately, but it doesn’t seem to be working out. But what about you guys?”

“I’m not good at dancing either.”

“Yeah, your brother might be a log, but you’re a twig.”

“Hey, that’s too much!”

“But it’s true. Seeing you move with your dry body…”

“You’re not much better either.”

Lee Jung-woo didn’t deny Jang Yoo-chul’s rebuttal.

Instead, he lifted his glass to lead the response.

“People without dancing talent tend to stay longer at drinking tables. Let’s wet our throats with a toast and watch the people dancing over there. Cheers!”

“Cheers!”

“Cheers!”

Indeed, after chugging their beers, they watched the stage.

Seeing 【Jungle】 employees dancing energetically on the stage, they felt a sense of vicarious satisfaction.

“Our employees have taken over the stage.”

“Could they like it that much?”

“We should come here often.”

“Oh, bro, it’s enough now. Coming too often would be a bad habit.”

“Is that so?”

At Jang Yoo-chul’s concern, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and drank his beer again.

And he said,

“But it’s not because of them, it’s because I want to come often.”

“Because of you, bro?”

“Yeah, I need to break free from being a log. I want to dance well and also have a blast when I play.”

“Ah…”

“So, that’s it for today.”

“What?”

Lee Hyun-woo suddenly stood up.

At the same time, he took out a newly made credit card and handed it to Lee Jung-woo.

“What? Bro, are you leaving?”

“When the CEO stays too long, employees can’t have fun. I’ll leave, so have a second round or whatever and send people home. Got it?”

“Hey, stay a bit longer.”

Lee Jung-woo tried to hold him back once more out of courtesy, but Lee Hyun-woo smiled and stood up.

His parting words before heading out were also impressive.

“If you talk about work at a company dinner, you’ll become a boss people want to avoid later, so be careful. Got it?”

“Gosh…”

With that advice, Lee Hyun-woo headed out of the nightclub.

The tropical night was in full swing, and he started to feel the heat along with the alcohol buzz.

“Because I didn’t play much in my previous life, I can’t help but feel limits when playing at a nightclub.”

Suddenly, he thought about learning to dance.

But then he concluded that there wasn’t a suitable place to learn, and his thoughts flowed to joining a club instead.

“If it’s a club, then PC communication?”

He decided that after email, promoting PC communication clubs would be better.

Even if he was reborn as a workaholic, he couldn’t help but think about work-related matters from time to time.

He even designed a more evolved form of PC communication clubs in his head.

He recalled the cafes of the two major portal sites in his previous life and, of course, took out his notebook when he got home.

Lately, he makes a habit of recording.

No matter how good his memory is, writing it down and checking it later is more accurate.

So, he expanded his plan again by recording today’s ideas.

“Anyway, at this rate, I might really become a conglomerate in the shortest time.”

Since he already lived once and mastered the path to success in his body.

Moreover, unless he was a failure, he was an assistant manager at a thriving large company in his previous life.

Thus, the company was rapidly growing, and wealth was accumulating in the account to the point where he needed someone to handle the accounting work.

Lee Hyun-woo thought positively.

“Being a conglomerate means there’s a lot to enjoy, so it’s good.”

Of course, he was confident that his personal inclination as a scholar would prevent him from falling into decadence or corruption.

Rather, because he hadn’t played much, he worried that he might not be able to enjoy it properly and ended the day by recording the leisure activities he hadn’t done in his previous life.

* * *

The next day.

After the meeting, Lee Hyun-woo immediately explained the parts he organized the previous day to Lee Jung-woo and Jang Yoo-chul.

“It’s like a PC communication club. Not bad.”

“At this rate, PC communication might harbor ill feelings towards us.”

“We gave them a chance to interact via email, but they refused. So, it can’t be helped.”

Lee Hyun-woo spoke as if he was the one with more power.

But it actually felt that way.

Anyway, wasn’t the era of PC communication gradually fading and the internet era coming?

“So, I think Candy Boy’s debut this time is a golden opportunity. We should secure their fans on our site. What do you two think?”

“Well…”

“Do you think Candy Boy will be as popular as Clones? And even if they become popular, isn’t it too much to expect that our 【Jungle】’s club would be better than PC communication clubs just because of the singers?”

“We won’t call it a club at 【Jungle】.”

“Pardon? Then what?”

“We’ll call it a café.”

“A café?”

“Yeah, an internet café. On our site, it would probably be something like 【Jungle Café】.”

The two couldn’t yet understand the power of an official celebrity café.

So, it was hard to empathize with Lee Hyun-woo, who spoke with such conviction.

However, they didn’t miss understanding Lee Hyun-woo explaining the concept of an internet café.

“As the CEO said, we can’t help but utilize servers for this.”

“That’s right. As the CEO said. But…”

“We’ll need more developers, right?”

When his brother Lee Jung-woo hesitated, Lee Hyun-woo jumped in and pinpointed the necessary part.

Then, Lee Jung-woo immediately nodded.

“If we want to work more comfortably, we’ll need to hire more.”

“Should we use the email again to recruit developers?”

“There are also many people from the club and department who just returned from the army. How about them?”

“Now that you mention it, since it’s almost vacation and the second semester is starting, they’ll start coming out one by one. It’s worth a try.”

“At this rate, we’ll bring in all the club and computer science department alumni from our school. Haha.”

While the two exchanged information with Lee Hyun-woo like a ping-pong game, Lee Hyun-woo smiled contentedly.

In fact, it didn’t matter whether people from a specific school gathered in the company or not.

What mattered was whether they could do the web service Lee Hyun-woo wanted or not.

“Then Lee Jung-woo, you look for more developers, and Jang Yoo-chul, start creating the internet café with the other programmers.”

“Yes, CEO.”

“Understood.”

“You know there’s no need to make it perfect, right? Just create it first like the email and update additional features later. Keep it simple at the beginning.”

“Yes, CEO!”

“Understood.”

Just like work instructions, the start of a portal site was crucial.

If it looked too complicated, users would find it hard to approach.

Start simple, then add features one by one, allowing for a period of adaptation—this was a basic principle.

Also, minimizing features made the beta test launch easier.

If they aimed for too perfect a development, only time would pass, so when Lee Hyun-woo thought it was enough, he urged the start of the café.

And upon seeing the café, it didn’t look bad.

“Then now all that’s left is to watch Candy Boy’s performance, which will be responsible for revitalizing the café?”

A deep smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo’s face.
