I still don't understand what kind of butterfly effect caused a pro gamer to become an aspiring singer.

When various thoughts were passing through my mind, a person named Hong Yo-han was exchanging greetings with Team Leader Shin Dong-woon and looking at Lee Hyun-woo.

"Have you ever used a synthesizer before?"

"No, it's my first time."

Although he probably heard it from Kim Yoon-sun's manager, Hyun Chang-soo, it must have been a bit shocking to hear it directly from Lee Hyun-woo's mouth.

But then,

"I've only been doing it for a year myself."

"Really?"

"Yes, I was interested in something else before, but I quickly shifted to this."

Just a year?

Is the synthesizer that easy? Or is Hong Yo-han a genius?

Lee Hyun-woo was skeptical, and so was Shin Dong-woon, as he looked at him suspiciously.

Well, since they were teaching a complete beginner like Lee Hyun-woo, there was no need to bring in someone very skilled.

'But since he's an aspiring singer, he should know at least a little bit, right?'

I don't know for sure, but the ensuing explanation wasn’t bad.

Just in case, Shin Dong-woon, who was standing by to offer help, wasn't needed.

In fact, Lee Hyun-woo dismissed him and started learning the basics of the synthesizer from Hong Yo-han.

Maybe it's because he was always a good student?

He found joy in learning and absorbed a lot at once.

Eventually, Lee Hyun-woo even started to mimic playing slightly.

Seeing this, Hong Yo-han was astonished and said,

"Wow, it's my first time seeing someone learn this quickly."

"Really?"

"Yes, I've been told that I learned really fast, but you are much faster, Chairman."

"Hahaha, I'm glad to hear that. But calling me Chairman is a bit much."

"Then what should I call you?"

"Since I am your disciple, you can just call me Lee Hyun-woo."

"Haha... that's a bit..."

"It's okay, please call me that."

"Yes, understood."

The reason Lee Hyun-woo chose the synthesizer was simple.

It allowed for solo performances without needing other instruments.

Moreover, with just this one instrument, he could compose music as well.

'Since it has come to this, I should focus and achieve results in a short time.'

Various songs played in his head.

These were the songs that were labeled as masterpieces in his previous life, both pop songs and K-pop songs.

Filled with excitement, he asked Hong Yo-han, who was about to leave after today's lesson,

"Do you have a car?"

"A car? No."

"Then let me give you a ride."

"Oh, it's okay..."

"I have a lot to ask you, so it would be better to ask on the way rather than taking up your time here."

Hong Yo-han smiled and nodded at Lee Hyun-woo's words.

'If I learn both theory and practice like this, I should be able to start performing and composing soon.'

The fun part was the next day.

As soon as the first in-house club, the 'Jungle Band,' was started, a huge number of people expressed their intention to join.

* * *

"What, Yucheol, you too?"

Since it was after work, Lee Hyun-woo called by name instead of title.

"Yes, you know I like music."

That’s why the MP3 player was created.

"Do you play any instruments?"

"Guitar."

"Really? I didn't know that. But no matter how much you like it, you still have to pass the competition."

"Huh? Really?"

"Yes, we're only going to pick two guitarists, but there are already eight applicants."

"Wow... a club where you have to audition to join."

"The interview is over, so you can leave now."

"What, it's that short?"

"Look at that, do you think we can make it any longer?"

Jang Yucheol automatically looked behind him.

Currently, more than 30 people were waiting in the basement.

"Yes... but you'll pick me, right?"

"I hate favoritism based on blood ties, regional ties, or school ties the most."

"I don't have any of those ties with you, though."

It's true that they weren't related by blood, didn't attend the same school, and didn't come from the same hometown since Jang Yucheol was from a different region.

"But we are friends. Next person, please."

Seeing Lee Hyun-woo coldly dismiss him, Jang Yucheol made a sad face.

When Jang Yucheol got up and left the interview place, his friends Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo approached him.

Today, those two planned to have a drink together.

"Did you pass?"

"Pass, my foot. I have to audition."

"Right? I saw a lot of people gathered earlier."

"Yes. It seems like almost half of the employees want to join."

"Was band this popular?"

"Well, we never had the chance to do band activities while in school. It's the same for others. Moreover, with rumors spreading that our hyung knows nothing about music, everyone wants to join."

"You're the one who spread that rumor, right?"

"Yes, I was worried no one would join the band hyung was enthusiastic about. Even Team Leader Shin Dong-woon was reluctantly made the club president."

"By the way, why aren't you two joining?"

"I'm planning to create my own club."

"Me too."

"Huh? What kind?"

"Bodybuilding club."

"PC game club."

"Wow..."

It made sense for Lee Jung-woo, who liked games, to create a PC game club.

But Oh Min-woo was starting a bodybuilding club?

"Are you doing it just to see Kim Mari more often?"

"Huh? You noticed?"

"How could I not notice? Do you like her that much?"

"Of course. It was love at first sight."

The training center in 【Jungle】, created by Lee Hyun-woo, had handsome and beautiful trainers who looked like they were selected based on their looks.

Because of that, it had a lot of users, and Oh Min-woo also went there frequently to work out.

In reality, he was more interested in seeing Kim Mari, one of the female trainers, whom he had fallen head over heels for.

Later, while holding a beer, he talked about her again.

"Today, Kim Mari told me not to come every day."

"Why?"

"She said it's not good for muscle growth. Muscles need time to rebuild after breaking down, but if I come every day, they won't have the chance to recover."

"You must be disappointed."

"Yes, I am... that's why I'm determined to create the club. It gives me an excuse to come every day."

"You really love women."

"The problem is women don't love him back."

"Right, I've never heard of him succeeding at a nightclub."

"I think he might fail this time too."

"Could you shut up?"

When their attacks shifted towards him, Oh Min-woo frowned and retorted.

But since it was true, he drank his beer and sighed.

"Honestly, lately, I'm most jealous of your hyung. He's very popular with women and succeeds at everything he touches. Sometimes I feel like there's always someone better in this world."

"Right, right. When he came back from the US with huge results, I was shocked. A $100 million investment? That hasn't been signed yet, right?"

"Yes, they said they would come to Korea to sign the contract formally. They will probably be here next week."

"If we expand to the US like this, we might dominate the portal sites in no time. Don't you think?"

"Not just portal sites. Online shopping, music sites, everything will take over the US market. That's why the investment company bet $100 million."

"But can we handle all this?"

"We're hiring people constantly, but it might not be enough."

"And that's where our hyung's greatness shines. He places people in the right positions and maximizes their abilities."

"His instructions are concise. We just need to follow what he says."

"Yes, that's correct. I felt the same."

Starting with the club, the conversation returned to business.

For these three, work was the most important thing in their lives.

They found their work so enjoyable that it couldn't be helped.

Even Lee Jung-woo, who had the DNA of a workaholic, had a reason for wanting to create a PC game club.

'I can use the club as an excuse to create more work even after work hours.'

Recently, a game scenario kept spinning in his head.

The core was this:

Three races, endless battles, resource competition.

If properly organized, it could be a very interesting PC game...

Even while drinking beer, he couldn't stop thinking about it.

* * *

Meanwhile, the original workaholic, Lee Hyun-woo, was so immersed in the synthesizer that he attended synthesizer classes daily and came home late because he practiced alone.

This weekend was no different.

On Saturday morning, after taking a lesson from Hong Yo-han, he was excited about properly applying macaroni music today.

"Master, I don't think I can give you a ride today."

"Oh, hyung, please don't call me master. It gives me goosebumps."

Having become close, Hong Yo-han called Lee Hyun-woo "hyung" while waving his hands.

"And I'm fine. If you keep giving me rides, I'll gain weight."

"But you are so skinny."

"No, lately, I've only been practicing and not exercising, so my belly fat is growing."

"Then sometimes use our training center on the second floor."

"Oh? Is there such a place?"

"You always come to the basement, so you didn't know. Normally, it’s not allowed, but since I'm the company representative, I can provide that service to my master."

"Hahaha."

Hong Yo-han laughed and stood up.

Out of curiosity, he asked Lee Hyun-woo again.

"Then can I use it for a while?"

"Of course."

It seemed he was genuinely concerned about his belly fat.

Or maybe he was just curious.

So when Lee Hyun-woo took him to the training center, his mouth dropped open.

"Wow..."

"We have gathered the best exercise equipment in Korea. Try using anything you like, and there are trainers over there, so ask them how to exercise."

"Yes, understood. Hahaha, hyung, thank you."

"You're welcome. As I said earlier, I should provide at least this much for my master."

Having said this, Lee Hyun-woo went downstairs and found Jang Yucheol there.

"Oh? You're here?"

"Yes, I came to practice too."

Jang Yucheol had joined the band club after fierce competition.

With as much passion as Lee Hyun-woo, he came to practice today as well.

"Perfect timing. Can you listen to this song for me?"

"What song?"

Instead of answering, Lee Hyun-woo played a song by a Spanish male duo on his MP3 player.

For reference, this MP3 player was newly released by 【Alpha Cast】 and had more capacity than the previous one.

Anyway, after letting him listen to the song through the earphones, Jang Yucheol smiled and responded,

"What is this?"

"You haven't heard it yet either? It's a hit song in Spain."

"Really?"

"Yes, but I personally want to change it a bit. That's why I'm learning the synthesizer so hard."

"How?"

"I want to make it more exciting. But I'm not skilled enough yet."

Macaroni was currently a hit only in Spain.

To become known worldwide, an American group would need to remix it, but unfortunately, that didn't happen in this life.

"Anyway, I want to start changing it little by little. Can you watch from the side?"

"Sure."

In fact, Lee Hyun-woo started to modify the original song using the synthesizer.

However, due to his inexperience, it didn't go well.

Even so, Jang Yucheol didn't hold back his admiration.

"If this is the skill of someone who learned for a week, I think you can handle the synthesizer freely within a month."

"Overpraising is not good, but thank you for making me feel good."

"It's true. Oh, should I create a music editing program for the synthesizer? You could remix more easily with it."

"That would be even better, thank you."

There were benefits to doing club activities with a programmer.

But shortly after, an even greater advantage appeared.

Hong Yo-han, who finished his workout, came down and showed interest in what Lee Hyun-woo and Jang Yucheol were making.

Naturally, Jang Yucheol let him listen to Macaroni on the MP3 player.

"This song is insanely addictive."

"Right?"

"A remix... can I try it for a bit?"

He started to join in the remixing work.
