Especially because it was a scene where Lee Hyun-woo was politely opening the door for Kim Yoon-sun, guiding her, it could be perceived as a date depending on the perspective.

Lee Jung-woo, who only now discovered Kim Yoon-sun, awkwardly stepped back.

"Ah... Hello?"

Kim Yoon-sun, flustered by the article, looked at her manager, Hyun Chang-soo.

Hyun Chang-soo also had a bewildered expression.

"This person didn't even tell me... I didn't know it would be in an article."

After uttering something as if he knew what was going on, he looked at Lee Hyun-woo with a distressed expression.

"CEO, I'm really sorry. I will handle this properly somehow."

"Wow, since it's in an article now, it might become a hot topic, right?"

"Pardon?"

Unexpectedly, Lee Hyun-woo replied with a calm voice.

"Ah, of course, we need to handle it."

"That's right. We need to handle it."

"That's right. I'm okay, but the CEO's image..."

"What's wrong with my image?"

Lee Hyun-woo gave a questioning look towards Kim Yoon-sun, who was worrying.

"As for me... To be honest, I'm an entertainer on a downward slope. If this one article catches the public's eye again, that's good for me. Besides, the CEO's image is so good that I can only benefit from it."

"Yoo... Yoon-sun ah."

Hyun Chang-soo stammered as he watched Kim Yoon-sun speak so frankly.

"It's true, oppa. I'm benefiting because of this person's image."

"Kim Yoon-sun, that's not necessarily true."

"Pardon?"

"Our company, Jungle Soft, also gains users when an article like this comes out. Especially with the upcoming portal site renewal, such a topical article allows us to naturally promote our website."

"Is... is that so?"

"And besides, we aren't in any kind of relationship, so it doesn't matter. If anything, you could say I'm just a passionate fan, right? Inform the reporter about this clearly, and if we also publicize that Kim Yoon-sun has signed an advertising model contract with us, it will be a win-win situation. Don't you think?"

On second thought, it seemed reasonable.

Even so, discussing turning a problematic article into an opportunity without getting upset was something.

To Hyun Chang-soo's eyes, Lee Hyun-woo seemed like an angel, and Kim Yoon-sun's feelings were swaying in an unknown direction.

Because of this, neither could immediately respond to Lee Hyun-woo's suggestion-like words.

Lee Hyun-woo had no choice but to clarify further.

"Can your manager inform the reporter of what I said? And if they want to interview me, ask them to come with an economic journalist."

"Ah, yes, yes. I'll do that."

"And where would you like to meet the president of One Computer? How about the coffee shop inside KBC Hall like last time?"

"Sure, yes."

"Kim Yoon-sun, please spare a moment. I'll teach you how to play Minesweeper and use the internet."

"Yes, I'll do that."

As Lee Hyun-woo neatly wrapped up the situation, the two could only respond with "yes."

However.

'He's a cold businessman.'

'Attractive.'

Both Hyun Chang-soo and Kim Yoon-sun's inner thoughts were reevaluating Lee Hyun-woo.

By the time Kim Yoon-sun learned how to play Minesweeper and use the internet and was leaving Jungle Soft, Lee Hyun-woo's impression had further etched itself into her heart.

It would be a lie to say one doesn't feel affection for a person who makes others comfortable and never loses their composure.

Because of this, on the way back in the car, Hyun Chang-soo spoke first.

"He's really a good person, right?"

"He is, but..."

"..."

"...Oppa, did you know about the scandal article?"

Hyun Chang-soo hesitated for a moment.

He immediately confessed.

"Well..."

"You knew."

"I'm sorry..."

"What's the point of apologizing to me? You should have explained it clearly earlier."

Kim Yoon-sun was slightly angry.

It seemed that Hyun Chang-soo had provided the pretext for this article.

"I feel unfair too. I told that reporter to notify me before publishing it, but they released it on their own today."

"Anyway, it's our fault. Because of you, how can I face that person?"

With mixed feelings of frustration and resentment towards Hyun Chang-soo, her voice was tinged with tears.

"Even though he introduced me to other places... And he kindly taught me Minesweeper and the internet..."

"Yoon-sun ah, I'll apologize again later. Okay?"

Hyun Chang-soo's promise was of no use.

Her eyes started to well up, and something wet trickled down her cheeks.

She felt she wouldn't be able to stand confidently in front of Lee Hyun-woo anymore.

* * *

A few days later, Hyun Chang-soo contacted Lee Hyun-woo on his mobile phone.

"Hello?"

(This is Hyun Chang-soo, Kim Yoon-sun's manager.)

"Ah, yes, hello."

(I wanted to thank you for your help with the president of One Computer.)

"I heard from President Kim."

In fact, Lee Hyun-woo was pleased to hear that Kim Yoon-sun was treated the same as she was at Jungle Soft, and this made him happy as a fan.

(And I just spoke with the reporter who wrote that article. I told them there was no relationship, just a fan and star relationship...)

"Good job."

(I feel so sorry. I also gave them your contact information. Is that okay?)

"I told you to do that. Did you also mention that Kim Yoon-sun is our company's advertising model?"

(Yes, I did. I also informed the economic journalist.)

"Thank you."

(I should be the one thanking and apologizing.)

Hyun Chang-soo expressed his gratitude and remorse so much that even Lee Hyun-woo felt a bit sorry.

Nevertheless, he handled the matter well.

Indeed, a journalist contacted him, and thus the next day, both an entertainment and an economic journalist visited Jungle Soft.

Naturally, it became an opportunity to promote the internet portal site.

After the interview, as the journalists left, the employees each had something to say.

"It looks like our user count will increase again."

"Isn't this going to make us the second Yaho?"

"There are a lot of 'second' things. The second Amazonas, the second E-Base, the second Yaho."

"Surely, we'll be able to widen the gap with the newly established places."

"I wasn't worried from the start."

"Don't lie."

"By the way, CEO, there's a shoot with Kim Yoon-sun tomorrow, would you like to go?"

Finally, Han Se-jin's question reached Lee Hyun-woo's ears.

Lee Hyun-woo smiled and nodded.

"I'll take some time to drop by."

Before that, there was a place he had to visit.

It was the nearby Giun Automobile sales office.

He was planning to get a car this time.

He should have had one already, but the reason for the delay was that he couldn't find a car he liked.

Since his comparison standard was a foreign car he drove in his previous life, it was understandable.

However, after being photographed using a taxi with Kim Yoon-sun last time, he thought he couldn't delay any longer.

So, he contracted a mid-sized car at the sales office and then headed to the studio shortly after.

"CEO, you are here?"

"You are here?"

Those who greeted him at the studio were Hyun Chang-soo and Han Se-jin.

Kim Yoon-sun, who was in the middle of a shoot, glanced at him once and then focused back on the camera.

"Kim Yoon-sun looks pretty today."

"Thank you. Ah, I heard the interview went well..."

"Yes, thanks to you."

"I specifically requested for it to be released quickly."

Although he didn't separately express his gratitude or apologies, Hyun Chang-soo was already paving the way for Lee Hyun-woo.

Moreover, he even congratulated him, possibly after hearing from Han Se-jin.

"I heard Taepyeong Cosmetics is selling well too."

"Yes, luckily, it's doing well."

It was true.

However, Han Se-jin cautiously added the reason beside him.

"I think it's not just because of the competitive pricing, but also because CEO appeared in several entertainment articles recently."

"Is... is that so?"

Han Se-jin also heard a lot of apologies and thanks from Hyun Chang-soo.

It seemed like he was trying to lighten the mood with his words.

Naturally, Lee Hyun-woo immediately agreed.

"Yes, that's correct. A lot of young women read entertainment articles. So, our Jungle Soft was mentioned, increasing visitors, and the cosmetics sales went up too."

"That's really fortunate. I hope Yoon-sun will hear about this soon. She felt really sorry to the CEO."

Lee Hyun-woo smiled bitterly.

And he thought that a star should not feel sorry because of a fan like him.

So, after a while, during a break in the shoot, he made this suggestion to Kim Yoon-sun.

"I think we're the same age, right? Twenty-seven?"

"Pardon? Ah, yes."

"Then shall we be friends?"

He found the best way to ease Kim Yoon-sun's burden.

Moreover, it seemed like a good idea to have a celebrity friend in this life, something he hadn't experienced in his previous life.

Fortunately, Kim Yoon-sun's face lit up, and she nodded.

"Okay, then let's drop the formalities next time we meet. Got it?"

"Okay."

Even though he said next time, the two were already speaking casually.

Additionally, when the shoot resumed, Kim Yoon-sun's expression became much more vibrant.

Her face seemed to have a rhythm to it.

'The first portal advertisement will turn out great.'

A deep smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo's face.

* * *

There was something that made Lee Hyun-woo's deep smile even broader.

Just before Chuseok, the research team at Jungle Soft finally completed the beta version of the portal site.

Lee Hyun-woo praised the key members, Woo Sang-won and Jang Yoo-chul, with a cheerful voice.

"This is faster than I expected."

"It seems to be because the working environment is good."

"Yes, that's right. Plus, Team Leader Woo Sang-won's old comrades joining in gave a boost."

"Oh, Team Leader Jang Yoo-chul had already done most of the work."

"We just helped a bit here and there."

"I think the frequent help from Team Leader Lee Jung-woo also played a part."

The people who were tense about the competition just a while ago had completely changed their tone, making Lee Hyun-woo laugh inwardly.

Moreover, the representative figure of the group, Woo Sang-won, went a step further and voiced his confidence in the success of the portal site.

"Yesterday, our email users surpassed 1 million. This means at least 800,000 people have a Jungle account."

"That's right. Some people may have two accounts."

"People without accounts also use the site. I estimate at least 2 million people. These users will definitely be absorbed into our portal. We are now as big as any major PC communication service."

Woo Sang-won came from the PC communication service Hi.

He often mentioned that he quit because he was overworked at his previous job.

Even now, his comparison point was PC communication.

Perhaps he earnestly wished for Jungle to be more successful than PC communication?

Finally, he presented an idea to Lee Hyun-woo.

"I think we should offer news services when we release the beta version."
