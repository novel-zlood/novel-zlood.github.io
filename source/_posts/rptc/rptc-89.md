After the fans revolted, most of the agencies started to back down.

Now, it seems like a good time to launch 【Jungle Music】 in this environment.

However, the potential side effects keep popping into my mind.

"Illegal sharing, that will become a problem someday, right?"

Since he had to find at least a way to mitigate it, Lee Hyun-woo went down to see Oh Min-woo.

“Why is the CEO gracing us with his presence?”

Seeing Oh Min-woo jokingly approach him, Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

“Next week, 【Jungle Music】 will be released.”

“What? Finally?”

“Yes, finally.”

“A lot of carols will be sold before Christmas.”

“That could be the case. Anyway, I foresee several problems arising once this is released. My head was a bit complicated because of that, so I came to see you.”

“Is it about illegal sharing?”

“Our Team Leader Oh Min-woo never misses a chance to explain things. That’s why you’re lovable.”

“I want to be adored by women, not you, hyung.”

“In the office, call me CEO, not hyung.”

“Oh, yes, CEO.”

Sometimes, you have to overlook minor mistakes in addressing each other.

To keep a free spirit in the company, this much was acceptable.

Moreover, this guy even knows about the potential issues arising from 【Jungle Music】.

“But, CEO, controlling illegal sharing is not easy.”

“Of course. If it were easy, we would have already stopped the rampant bootleg tapes and CDs on the streets.”

“So, you can’t eradicate it but want to reduce it as much as possible?”

“I need your skills. Whether it’s preventing copying or applying some other technology to make illegal sharing difficult… Hm? Make it happen.”

“Do you think I’m a magic wand or something?”

How could Lee Hyun-woo delve into the technical aspects?

He can say this because he doesn’t know.

“Do your best, okay?”

With a resigned smile, Oh Min-woo shrugged and nodded.

“Yes, I will. Anyway, the data storage technology is all finished.”

“What? It’s finally done?”

“Of course. Working with Team Leader Lee Jung-woo made it almost perfect. You’ll save some server purchase costs now.”

“Is that all? We should start the business I mentioned to you two earlier.”

That was the cloud.

Like a sparrow that can’t pass by a mill, Lee Hyun-woo gets excited whenever a new task arises.

Countless business ideas pop into his head.

“There are so many things we can do with the cloud.”

【Amazoness】 derives 80% of its profits from the cloud, highlighting its importance.

Thus, if the cloud is well-established, 【Jungle】 would become an empire where the sun never sets.

Such thoughts flashed through his mind, and Oh Min-woo casually made the next remark.

“Wow, our CEO really has a lot to do. It seems like you’re constantly working.”

Lee Hyun-woo flinched.

“How can this be? I tried, but I still look like a workaholic.”

But, thinking it over, what he said was true.

Recently, the part where he invested the most time was the music service using MP3.

In fact, it advanced a few years ahead.

He pushed it forward excitedly, which led to this.

As a result, many things followed.

Just recently, he ordered 100,000 units from a modem company in Belgium called 【Alcart】, and Kang Dong-ho was already moving, almost on the verge of selling them to 【Korea Telecom】 and 【Korea Electric】.

They also had to hurry because ADSL had already started to be commercialized in some parts of Seoul.

Meanwhile, a modem company from the U.S. would visit tomorrow.

Naturally, it was to help Kim Yoon-soo produce ADSL modems via an OEM method.

In fact, the U.S. side, aiming to expand its market, had no reason to reject this method, so it was almost a settled matter.

All of this was achieved over November and December.

“I think I need to take a little break.”

Lee Hyun-woo’s goal was to take a proper break when he did.

He decided to take his employees away after seeing the start of 【Jungle Music】.

So, the person who came to mind was Kim Ah-young.

“Since there’s Seorabeol Hotel in Jeju Island, I should rent it.”

With successive successes, the account balance was snowballing.

It was time to give back a little.

To the employees who worked hard.

* * *

The next day, after finishing negotiations with the modem company from the U.S. and perfectly ‘tossing’ it to Kim Yoon-soo, Lee Hyun-woo immediately visited Seorabeol Hotel.

He had contacted Kim Ah-young in advance, but for some reason, she was waiting in the lobby.

“Huh? Why are you out here?”

“Huh? Ah, just.”

Seeing Kim Ah-young, with her bright face and distinct beauty, made him smile naturally.

So, with a smile, Lee Hyun-woo asked.

“You haven’t had dinner yet, right?”

“You said we’d eat together?”

“Yes, I have something to talk about while we eat.”

“What is it? Is it about the preparations for entering Japan this time?”

“Oh, they’ll take care of that themselves.”

While moving with Kim Ah-young, he could confirm another recent task.

It was the departure of developers to Japan for 【Jungle Japan】.

“Wow, we were even preparing to enter Japan. I really have done a lot of work.”

Now it was time to practice work-life balance.

After ordering at the hotel restaurant, Lee Hyun-woo immediately asked Kim Ah-young about the Jeju Island branch of Seorabeol Hotel.

“Your hotel has a branch in Jeju Island, right? Can we use it?”

“Who do you mean by ‘we’?”

“Of course, the employees of 【Jungle】.”

“All the employees?”

“Of course. Even those who went to Japan will come back later and need to be sent. I’ll divide them into two groups. One will have a workshop in Jeju Island while the other works here.”

Although it's called a workshop, the purpose was to escape the boring routine, just like last time.

Knowing this, Kim Ah-young clicked her tongue.

“Your company really spends big on its employees. Isn’t the total number about a hundred?”

“Probably.”

“The cost must be no joke.”

“That’s why I came to ask my friend Kim Ah-young. Since we’ll be using it as a group, could you give us a discount?”

At Lee Hyun-woo’s request, Kim Ah-young raised her eyebrows.

Then she said,

“When?”

“Next week.”

“The end of December. That’s an extremely busy season for us.”

“Right. So, I’m sorry again. I’d be grateful if you could give us a discount.”

“Just being grateful in words isn’t enough. What will you do if I give you a discount?”

“Huh?”

“Oh, I mean I can give you a discount. But I also need to get something in return.”

“Um… well… I haven’t thought about that. Let me think…”

“Wait, stop thinking.”

“Huh?”

“It won’t work. Just save this favor for later. I’ll use it when I need it.”

Kim Ah-young quickly interrupted Lee Hyun-woo before he could say anything.

The reason was simple.

She didn’t want it to be settled with just soju mixed with beer and fries like last time.

‘That won’t do at all.’

She wanted something really nice in return.

For example?

‘Spending time together in Jeju Island’s Seorabeol Hotel?’

A mysterious smile spread on Kim Ah-young’s face.

For some reason, she felt that she could spend some time alone with him in Jeju Island.

* * *

Unaware of Kim Ah-young’s thoughts, Lee Hyun-woo returned home and turned on the computer.

With a smile, he opened 【Jungle】.

Countless banners caught his eye.

It was proof that a lot had been accomplished in a short period.

Of course, he didn’t access the portal site just to check that.

It was to send a surprise email to the employees.

《To all respected employees of 【Jungle】》

Hello, this is CEO Lee Hyun-woo.

The year has flown by, and Christmas and the year-end are already upon us.

1996 has passed by so quickly, it feels like the blink of an eye.

At this point, I plan to spend some time with all of you, reflecting on the past year.

This will be at the end of the year, and we will wrap up our work and plan for the future together in a workshop.

Unlike the previous workshop, this time it will be in a more refreshing location.

It’s Jeju Island, and I’ve reserved Seorabeol Hotel.

I hope we will have a meaningful time again and make further leaps forward in the coming year.

Having written this much, Lee Hyun-woo paused to imagine the faces of the employees who would receive the email.

“Will they like it?”

They might, but you never know with people.

“Let’s finish and send the email first.”

After finishing the rest and sending the email, the phone rang, and it was Kim Yoon-soo.

(Hyun-woo! Come out!)

“Yes? Why so sudden? What’s going on, hyung?”

(Everything went so well! I didn’t expect the U.S. company to give an immediate ‘okay’!)

That was expected.

Lee Hyun-woo had already laid the groundwork.

Also, the company had already confirmed the high-speed internet infrastructure in Korea, so there was no way they would refuse a profitable opportunity.

(I’m in such a good mood. I thought of you while drinking with the employees, so I called.)

“Yes? Oh, in that case, I shouldn’t intrude.”

(No, you must come. Absolutely!)

Listening to his already tipsy voice, Lee Hyun-woo laughed and said,

“If I go, it’ll dilute the meaning.”

(What meaning? I just put a spoon on the table you set. Our employees need to know that.)

“That’s not true. Well then, I’m planning a workshop in Jeju Island at the end of this month as a reward for my employees who worked hard. Should I take you too?”

(Huh? A workshop in Jeju Island with your employees?)

“Yes, that’s the plan.”

(Oh… then you shouldn’t come here. If our employees find out, it’ll ruin the mood. They’ll compare and feel bad.)

“Yes, so you should celebrate with the 【One Computer】 team. That’s what you should do this time.”

(Okay, got it. But I’m still grateful. Thank you!)

Judging by his loud voice over the receiver, he must have drunk a lot.

Lee Hyun-woo hung up, laughing.

“Come to think of it, I helped 【One Computer】, 【Alpha Cast】, and 【Samjin Computer】 this year.”

The more he looked back on the year, the more he realized he had accomplished.

Perhaps the Jeju Island workshop wasn’t just a gift for the employees but also for himself.

Maybe that’s why?

“I already want to go.”

Every year-end, Hallasan becomes bustling.

Many climbers visit to wrap up the year and greet the new one.

Lee Hyun-woo suddenly wondered what it would be like to greet the first sunrise from the top of Hallasan.

Naturally, such scenes played out in his mind.

But,

“Huh?”

Why was he unknowingly picturing himself with Kim Ah-young at the end of this?
