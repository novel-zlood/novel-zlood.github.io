As the year comes to an end,

For Lee Hyun-woo, it marks the end of his second year since returning.

The first year was eventful, but this year was just as, if not more, filled with numerous events.

The most noteworthy among them was his relationship with Kim Ah-young.

Their affection for each other deepened as time passed.

Today was no different.

By now, the two no longer cared about others' gazes and headed towards Jongno.

Naturally, their secretaries and bodyguards were putting in a lot of effort to make sure they could be less concerned.

“Lately, it feels like the attention on us has decreased.”

“Yeah, it seems so.”

Fortunately, even when people recognized them as they walked by, they pretended not to know them.

This was Jongno.

Since it was the weekend, there were many people, but most just passed by.

It seemed more like the novelty had worn off rather than a lack of interest.

Of course, that didn't mean they were completely out of the spotlight, as they drew attention the moment they entered the pub.

Ignoring the stares, the two sat down at a suitable spot and resumed their conversation.

“Coming here again, it might become a place of memories.”

“Yeah, right.”

Lee Hyun-woo laughed at Kim Ah-young's words.

This pub was the first place where they had shared a drink together.

Perhaps because it held significant memories?

Kim Ah-young took out a digital camera.

“Taking more pictures?”

“Yeah, I need to stock up on photos to post on my blog later.”

“Are you really going to post them?”

“Is it not okay?”

“No, it's just... I was worried your parents might not like it.”

“They probably won't like it. But lately, because of the youngest, there's been a wave of democratization at our house.”

“Hahaha.”

Lee Hyun-woo burst out laughing at her expression.

It seemed like Kim Na-yoon was uncontrollable at home.

“And with oppa making the news all the time, even if I post a bit, the attention gets divided.”

“Ah...”

The news about Kim Tae-hyun was, of course, about his marriage.

It was confirmed for next March, according to the news.

‘I wonder if hyung proposed in the way I told him?’

He was curious about the result of the secret SNS proposal method.

Just as he was thinking of asking about it later, a waitress approached to take their order.

But this waitress,

“Could you give me an autograph?”

She asks for everything.

Should he find it amusing that she looks at a businessman like a celebrity?

“Of course. I'll sign for you and even take a picture to hang in the store.”

“Really?”

“But give us a lot of complimentary snacks.”

“Ah, yes...”

At the end, she looked at Lee Hyun-woo with a look that said 'the rich always do more.'

Lee Hyun-woo, unfazed, took the digital camera from Kim Ah-young and handed it to the waitress.

“Then, please take a picture. Oh, let's take a picture together while we're at it.”

“Really?”

“But make sure to give us a lot of complimentary snacks.”

“Yes, yes, I will.”

The waitress, now ecstatic at the thought of taking a picture, soon had the owner join in.

And that wasn't the end.

“Can I also get an autograph...”

“Yes, of course.”

“Can I also take a picture? I have a camera phone...”

“But please keep our conversation here a secret.”

“Of course, I will.”

Lee Hyun-woo smiled and granted the wishes of those who wanted autographs and photos.

For those without camera phones, he even offered to take pictures with the digital camera and send them via email, but his final words were the best.

“Everyone! I'll cover the drinks for tonight!”

“Waaaaa!”

“Waaaaa!”

After such a joyous atmosphere, he sat down and resumed his conversation with Kim Ah-young.

“If we are this generous, they won't spread our conversation, will they?”

“Anyway, with our secretaries and bodyguards around, I don't think they can hear us over there.”

“Just saying. Hahaha.”

Lee Hyun-woo laughed. Whether it was the year-end atmosphere or the joy of connecting with Kim Ah-young after returning, he was in a very good mood.

Continuing in this good mood, he took out an invitation for Kim Ah-young.

“Here, this.”

“Huh? What is it?”

“Our music club concert.”

“What? You also do concerts?”

“Of course. I've been honing my skills in my spare time, so you must come and see.”

“Got it, I'll bring my siblings.”

“Ah, but you know not to expect too much, right? I haven't been learning the synthesizer for long.”

“No way? I'm going to expect a lot.”

“Su... suddenly I feel pressured. Shouldn't have given you the invitation?”

“No takebacks. Now, drink to that.”

As Kim Ah-young raised her glass, Lee Hyun-woo smirked and clinked glasses with her, then took a sip.

Seeing this scene, the people around them also smiled.

It was amusing to see that the top conglomerate families of Korea, and the rising entrepreneur known more globally than domestically, were just like any other youth.

Even the secretaries and bodyguards who accompanied them had almost given up after seeing the atmosphere.

'Oh well, they can't be confined to the frameworks of security and assistance, so what's the big deal?'

* * *

Many guests had camera phones, so that evening, pictures of the two clinking glasses and having a joyful conversation were uploaded to blogs.

As someone shared these blog photos, Lee Hyun-woo was able to see them by the next day's end.

At first, it might have been frustrating to have no privacy, but he thought to himself that if he couldn't avoid it, he might as well enjoy it, and calmly reviewed the photos.

He began to feel a desire to change his ordinary appearance.

‘Should I dye my hair again?’

He had once dyed his hair orange, and back then, not many recognized him.

Now, his hair was back to black.

‘With the year-end concert coming up, I should go for a stylish look.’

The name of the internal music club Lee Hyun-woo was part of was originally ‘Jungle Band.’

Later, it changed to ‘Eumjeong.’

It was an idea by Shin Dong-woon to use the company's name and make it ‘Jungle of Music.’

They used the initials, and it turned out to be a name that fit the identity of the music club very well.

Though they couldn't always participate due to being busy, it was Shin Dong-woon who consistently maintained the club from start to finish.

Perhaps it was due to his responsibility as the president of Eumjeong, but regardless of the motivation, he actively recruited new members recently, and the year-end concert was also his idea.

“So, what do you think about dyeing my hair? I think it might not be a bad idea to stand out a bit during the concert.”

Discussing this with him after work today, Shin Dong-woon smiled and nodded.

“That's up to you, CEO.”

“I disagree.”

Jang Yoo-chul spoke firmly.

“When you dyed it orange last time, it looked too frivolous.”

“Really? Then I'll go with a different color this time.”

“What color?”

“Hmm. How about gold?”

“Whoa...”

“Okay, then I'll go with brown.”

“Alright, that sounds reasonable.”

It might seem like he was seeking permission for everything, but Jang Yoo-chul was the vice president of Eumjeong.

Since he didn't want to stand out alone at the concert, he thought it was necessary to consider the opinions of these two.

“Alright, shall we practice today as well?”

“My hands are itching. Let's get started!”

“Yes, let's begin.”

“Go, go, go!”

Meanwhile, the number of members increased to seven.

Unfortunately, two of them, who were almost beginners and needed a lot of practice, couldn't participate in this year's concert and could only prepare.

But what was surprising was that Lee Hyun-woo wasn't considered a beginner.

Not only that, but his performance on the synthesizer was quite impressive.

He even excelled in composing and writing lyrics.

It was inevitable.

The songs he had longed for from his past life didn't exist in this one.

Being someone with a great memory, he recreated those songs from his past life, leaving the members of Eumjeong in awe.

It was the same now.

He was singing a song titled ‘Marry Me,’ and the two trainees who had recently joined the club were quickly moved by the emotion, clapping as soon as the song ended.

“Wow... That was amazing.”

“I think we could debut with this song.”

At that moment, Lee Hyun-woo shook his head.

“We decided not to use the songs made here for commercial purposes, so that's absolutely not happening.”

Indeed, no matter how much of a cheat it was, he felt guilty about debuting or selling songs from his past life.

He had once created songs or made suggestions to Kim Yoon-sun and others with absolute pitch, but it weighed on his mind.

Because of this, he firmly stated that commercial use was not allowed, and seeing the songs that came out after, people couldn't help but feel regret.

Even now, Vice President Jang Yoo-chul expressed the most regret.

“It's such a shame. Even if we don't debut, these songs would be hits if we sold them to others.”

“I think so too.”

“Then why...”

“I feel like I might be able to create even better songs someday.”

“What?”

“I mean, it's my wish to create a song that I pour my heart and soul into, so until then, it's a no.”

“You want to create something better than the songs you've made so far?”

Lee Hyun-woo nodded with a smile.

In fact, he wanted to create songs unrelated to his past life someday.

‘Since my alter ego Nostradamus is now retired, it might not be a bad idea to bring out a composer alter ego later.’

It was an idea inspired by the fact that famous composers in his past life started using interesting names at some point.

Like Brave Brothers, Shinsadong Tiger, or even Black Eyed Pilseung.

Lee Hyun-woo thought that if he named his alter ego similarly, people wouldn't recognize him.

‘Maybe from next year, I'll start creating my own songs.’

* * *

A few days later, at the year-end concert.

In fact, the stage wasn't big enough to be called a concert hall.

The basement of Jungle's first expansion building was still the space where Eumjeong performed.

However, the attendees were no joke.

Kim Tae-hyun, a prominent figure in a leading conglomerate, attended with his fiancée, along with Kim Ah-young and her three younger sisters.

From Aejeong Group, Choi Seon-hwa, who was highlighted by the media as a potential successor, also attended.

Other representatives from companies closely associated with Lee Hyun-woo were present, as well as representatives and managers from some entertainment companies.

“What? Lee Hyun-woo made that?”

“Yes, that's what I heard.”

“That's crazy. They could debut with this.”

“Indeed, Lee Hyun-woo's deep voice is incredibly charming and would definitely work in the market.”

People started murmuring in the middle.

Since hit songs were pouring out of an internal club band, it was no wonder the entertainment companies were in an uproar.

After the concert ended, they approached Lee Hyun-woo with a suggestion:

“Are you considering debuting...?”

“No, not at all.”

Lee Hyun-woo's voice was firm.

“Then are you considering selling the songs you sang...?”

“No.”

His answer was the same.

The entertainment representatives had expressions of regret on their faces.

But what could they do?

He wasn't a starving musician, so he couldn't be swayed by money, and more importantly, he had no intention of doing so, leaving them no choice but to give up.

Meanwhile, Lee Hyun-woo thought to himself:

'Just wait a little longer. I'll come back with amazing songs someday.'
