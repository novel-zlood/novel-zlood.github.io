In fact, Lee Hyun-woo had no desire to make a fortune by selling assembled PCs.

There were many expenses such as facilities, equipment, labor costs, and rent, so it would take time to achieve economies of scale.

Therefore, after investigating to this extent and telling Lee Jung-woo again at home,

"You need to consider compatibility. If they don't match, it will be hard to assemble."

It seemed like some modifications would be necessary.

"Oh, really?"

"If today was the day you were going to find out the prices, why didn't you tell me? It would have been better if I had gone around with you."

"You have your own work to do. Leave this to me."

This was the first task Lee Hyun-woo undertook after joining the trading company.

Heading into the unknown without any prior knowledge.

Any finished product requires components, and to find out about them, you need patience and meticulousness.

Would it be any different for computers?

'Did 【Deokseong】 miss anything? I know a bit about computers too.'

Moreover, now that he had a brother to consult with, he considered himself lucky and knocked again the next day.

"Oh? You're here again today."

"You didn't buy anything from another place yesterday? Then I'll give you a bit more of a discount."

Some people recognized his face on his repeated visits, but when Lee Hyun-woo asked numerous questions again, they complained that he was being too exacting.

"I can't give you any more discount. Does he think we are in this business to eat dirt?"

"You don't expect to get it for free, do you? A young man shouldn't be like that."

"Wow, he wants to get it for nothing."

Indeed, there were many unfriendly remarks.

'The Yongsan Electronics Market was always unfriendly.'

This would later cause them to lose customers to larger computer distribution companies.

Consumers who were annoyed by the inconvenience and unpleasantness, even when trying to get after-sales service, naturally preferred products from major companies or friendly stores.

Moreover, in the current Yongsan Electronics Market, customers had to take the assembled computer home themselves and bear the inconvenience of bringing it back for after-sales service.

Yet, people flocked to this place because of its superior 'cost-effectiveness.'

The price of a computer with a certain level of specs was around 1.5 million won.

So, what if they included only the cost of components and Lee Jung-woo's part-time wages and listed it on an auction site?

'They would go nuts, right?'

A slight smile appeared on Lee Hyun-woo's face.

The issue here was trust.

When spending a large sum of money on a purchase, it's inevitable to feel uneasy if the place has no brand name.

'Trust is about quality. If the quality isn't good, you just have to guarantee it.'

No electronic product is without faults.

So, wouldn't it be better than the Yongsan Electronics Market if they simply offered to come and fix it themselves if it breaks?

Even though it was an investment, Lee Hyun-woo, busy as ever, casually mentioned this to his brother again.

"Is the site almost ready?"

"I was already working on it a bit. But why?"

"Make sure to write that we will install the computer ourselves and provide after-sales service."

His brother's eyes widened.

"What? Really?"

"Of course, you have to do it."

"......"

"I'll give you an outdoor work allowance. Double."

"Okay."

He thought his brother was someone who didn't listen well, but now he realized he was quite simple-minded.

'Why didn't I know this in my previous life and scold him so much?'

A simple-minded personality had many advantages.

Especially now, this personality was a great help to Lee Hyun-woo.

And something even more encouraging happened that evening.

"How much do you need?"

Finally, after days of consideration, his parents made a decision.

Lee Hyun-woo's slightly drooping eyes formed a charming smile.

And in a deep, comforting voice, he told his parents the amount he needed.

"For now, 1.5 million won."

"You talked big about investment, is that enough? Of course, I'm not saying it's a small amount."

"I said for now."

Lee Hyun-woo couldn't predict how much more would be needed in the future.

But for now, he needed an investment for the cost of assembling three computers.

Listening quietly beside him was Lee Jung-woo.

A little later, he returned to his room and showed curiosity to his brother.

"1.5 million won? Isn't it originally around 1.7 million won?"

"You have to negotiate to bring down the price."

After going around Yongsan Electronics Market, he had solid confidence that he could get a discount.

In Yongsan Electronics Market, prices varied greatly from one store to another.

Based on that information, he said he could lower the price.

"Are you really going to negotiate the price?"

"Yes, punk. You just have to assemble it well with the parts I buy."

After saying this, Lee Hyun-woo headed to Yongsan Electronics Market like a sprinter tying his shoelaces tightly.

And after diligently going around for two days, he finally managed to buy components for three computers for 1.5 million won.

"Exactly 1,497,000 won! Let's round it up to 1.5 million won."

"Wow, you really did it. I guess I underestimated you, hyung."

"How did you see me?"

"A bookworm?"

Lee Hyun-woo laughed at his brother's description.

Indeed, before joining the company, he wasn't good at brazenly negotiating.

But after living a long life, there was nothing he hadn't tried.

He could write an epic novel if he wanted to.

"To make money, you need a thick skin. I couldn't do it because I didn't try, but now that I've made up my mind, I can do anything."

"Right. It seems transformation in front of money is not a crime."

"Anyway, how about you? Are you almost done? To start assembling the computer, the website should be almost complete, right?"

"It's almost done. Want to see?"

Lee Hyun-woo nodded and looked at his brother's computer.

Seeing the already powered-on computer reminded him of the latest PCs he had handled before.

It wasn't comparable, so he quickly shook his head.

Still, he certainly felt one thing.

'It's slow.'

Feeling frustrated, he thought he needed to create an environment where good computers could come out quickly, and then the website appeared before his eyes.

"It's better made than I thought."

"Uh... yeah, it is."

Lee Hyun-woo agreed with his brother's pride.

Although it wasn't as fancy as the ones he saw in his previous life, for now, he considered that as long as this crude page worked properly, it was fine and reminded his brother of the next task.

"So, should we start making the assembled PC now?"

"I can make it quickly. This was what I did while eating."

"Really? Did you have these classes every day at school?"

"No way... I did it in a club."

"In a club? So there are other friends who do this kind of work besides you?"

"If they're from our club, they can assemble a PC with their eyes closed."

Although his brother often exaggerated, it expressed his familiarity.

Maybe later, he could secure those club friends to save on labor costs?

'Let's check how the business goes to some extent first.'

One should have confidence but not count their chickens before they hatch.

Hadn't he suffered in his previous life due to wrong predictions about SPA products?

Unaware of these thoughts, his brother was busy bragging about his club.

"Although it's not large, we can even make a server."

Listening to his brother saying they could do everything, Lee Hyun-woo nodded and said,

"Got it. Then assemble it as quickly as possible."

"Yes, sir."

Lee Hyun-woo chuckled at his brother's joke.

'I don't know about other things, but I'm glad things are progressing faster than I thought.'

* * *

Really, in the blink of an eye, Lee Jung-woo had prepared the assembled PC.

After continuously simulating the website, he asked,

"What will the site name be?"

"You decide."

"Hmm... I do have one name in mind."

"What is it?"

"【Jungle】."

"【Jungle】?"

"It means you have to fiercely offer prices and take things away in the jungle."

Although it sounded like a knock-off of the online shopping site 【Amazoness】, Lee Hyun-woo laughed and nodded.

"Good, I like it."

"I'm excited about this."

"Don't count your chickens before they hatch. High expectations lead to big disappointments."

"That's true, but... how can you control your feelings?"

"If you have work to do, of course you can. The domain isn't even connected yet."

"Got it. Anyway, I thought you had changed a bit, but you haven't changed this perfectionist trait."

Hearing his brother's words, Lee Hyun-woo realized he was back to his workaholic mode.

'In this life, I set a goal of work-life balance, but I'm quickly buried in work.'

This won't do.

He had to always remember to relax.

Thinking this to himself, Lee Hyun-woo quickly revised what he had said to his brother.

"Still, take your time. Don't make it by neglecting your meals."

"Oh? Are you pretending to care about me?"

"Yes, punk. Hahaha."

"Hahaha."

The two brothers, full of dreams of creating Korea's first online auction site.

After a while, they finally connected the domain and launched 'Jungle' to the world.

The first product they strategically listed was an assembled PC.

"With just one item, the site looks empty."

"Let's think positively. Got it? Don't be disappointed if it doesn't sell."

"Uh... it won't be easy, but I'll try. But do you think it won't sell at that price?"

"Again with high expectations."

The price was a shocking 700,000 won.

So honestly, Lee Hyun-woo was also quietly excited.

How high would it go through internet auction?

At least 800? At most 1 million?

'Even after haggling, the computers sold in Yongsan were 1.3 million. Conservatively, it should be around 1 million.'

Premature predictions are dangerous.

And decisions to be made kept coming.

"Oh, right. What about the auction period?"

"Let's make it a week."

"Should we upload photos too?"

"That's not easy."

"Of course, uploading photos is no joke for us and for the other side too. But it's better to have them than not. Since we don't have equipment, I'll use circulating images."

"Okay."

There were many regrets.

If they had more money, they should have focused on marketing to promote the site, but now they could only hope it would spread naturally.

* * *

Meanwhile, Lee Jung-woo seemed to be making separate efforts to sell the assembled PC.

"Hyung, I posted several articles on PC communication."

"Oh, really?"

"One person has already shown interest."

"Really?"

Checking the site at his brother's words, Lee Hyun-woo saw that someone had bid 700,010 won.

As expected.

"Oh, another person bid. 700,020 won... geez, penny pinchers."

"Consider it good news that two people have already bid."

"These two are competing? They're increasing by 10 won increments."

In a tone that showed frustration, his brother spoke, and Lee Hyun-woo responded with a confident voice.

"Soon, a 'big player' will appear."
