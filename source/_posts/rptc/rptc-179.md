Lee Hyun-woo is a graduate of the Department of Economics.

Therefore, his mentor was inevitably a professor in the Department of Economics.

But then, the head of the Ministry of Science and Technology?

After a while, they had a chance to talk alone and he was able to hear more details.

"I'll probably be the last head of the Ministry of Science and Technology under this government. Two people have been appointed so far, one was a public official and the other was a scholar-turned-politician. They both had clear pros and cons."

"It must have been like night and day, right? One who follows the manual and one with a rich imagination."

Public officials naturally adhere to manuals.

As a result, they tend to hesitate and are not bold.

On the other hand, politicians generally have rich imaginations and tend to judge the results after diving in first.

"That should have been the case, but as I mentioned earlier, he was a scholar-turned-politician. You know him, right? Dr. Jo In-sung."

"Of course, he's considered the top theorist in information and communication in our country."

"Right, while the commercialization of high-speed internet accelerated thanks to Jungle's intervention, it was because of him that our country became the second in the world after the U.S. to launch the internet."

"But he only focused on theory."

"Exactly. The ideals were good, but reality didn’t support them. There were gaps here and there, and the budget wasn't properly utilized. Still, he managed to show off well."

In short, it means the shortcomings of both a scholar and a politician were combined.

"Thanks to the solid foundation of our country's information and communication, it received good public evaluation, but there seemed to have been a lot of internal noise."

Lee Hyun-woo nodded.

In fact, he knew well that the hesitance of organizations like Daehan Communication was all due to the head of the Ministry of Science and Technology.

To break regulations and get approvals, the inherent imagination of a politician was needed, but they failed to recognize the current reality and invested money in the wrong places.

"If it weren’t for me, high-speed internet would have been delayed by about two more years."

It wasn’t self-praise. The fact that Lee Hyun-woo effectively combined ideals with reality accelerated Korea's information society significantly.

"In the midst of that, I got recommended. As you know, even though I majored in economics, I know the field better than most professors at the school, right?"

"I've learned a lot from you too, professor."

The reason he decided on IT without hesitation after returning was partly because he believed that field would lead the future, but it was also because Lee Hyun-woo had no aversion to the related industry.

People of Lee Hyun-woo's age didn’t learn computers proficiently in college, but thanks to Professor Geum Sang-joon in front of him, he could at least get familiar with computers.

Moreover, Geum Sang-joon was more of a pragmatist than a theorist.

For that reason, although he was an economics professor, he had a lot of interest in computers.

In short, it meant that an information and communication expert who knew economics well was appointed as the head of the Ministry of Science and Technology,

‘This is completely different from my past life.’

Perhaps the government made such a bold decision because it had just over half a year left.

Anyway, it wasn’t bad for Lee Hyun-woo.

He was sure that the Geum Sang-joon he knew would take a practical approach and run policies that were very friendly to the information and communications industry.

"Honestly, even though I've been appointed, what do I know? I’ll be counting on you from now on."

"I don't know if I’ll be of help, but I’ll visit often."

Even though he said this, a lot could change in the remaining period.

The first thing that came to mind was the issue of protecting intellectual property rights.

Strengthening this law could reduce the distribution of pirated games or music.

‘Okay, I’ve thought of the first thing to mention.’

Not today.

If he starts with a request as if he was waiting for it, their next meeting would become burdensome.

‘Still, it feels like a new path is opening up by meeting the professor again at the alumni meeting.’

Lee Hyun-woo spent the rest of the time smoothly and left Seorabeol Hotel.

* * *

Late at night, Kim Ah-young’s phone rang.

“Hello?”

(It’s me.)

It was Lee Hyun-woo.

“Did you do well today?”

(It wasn’t bad. I’m grateful to Tae-hyun hyung. He introduced me to a lot of valuable connections.)

She thought it might be a courtesy.

Originally, the Lee Hyun-woo she knew didn’t seem like someone who would form and utilize such connections.

(Anyway, I thanked Tae-hyun hyung, but I felt it wasn’t enough, so I’m calling you. Please tell him later that I’m genuinely grateful.)

“Sure, I will.”

Still, she was thankful for his considerate words.

‘Honestly, we’re the ones who gained more by meeting him.’

The information Lee Hyun-woo casually dropped wasn’t just one or two things.

Later, her oppa Kim Tae-hyun told her that thanks to Lee Hyun-woo’s information, they could stop a transaction early and avoid huge losses when a certain group faced a crisis.

Additionally, the joint venture with Son Jung-woo, server production, the development of a new mobile phone, entry into the cloud business, and even her younger brother Kim Ah-jin’s online fashion mall.

All were walking the path of success.

So she said,

“But I’m more thankful.”

(For what?)

“Just… you always do well for me.”

(Haha, you’ve become quite sappy.)

She spoke ambiguously to end the call without discussing business today.

But was it because she mentioned Kim Tae-hyun during the call?

Knock, knock, knock.

After hanging up, she checked who was knocking and found it was Kim Tae-hyun.

And her perceptive oppa, knowing she had just talked to Lee Hyun-woo, asked in a meaningful voice,

“Did Hyun-woo say anything?”

“Oh, he said he’s very grateful to you for introducing him to good people.”

“Did he really say that?”

“Yes, why?”

“I’m relieved. By the way, do you know that Hyun-woo is being considered the top groom candidate in the political and business circles?”

Kim Ah-young’s eyebrows shot up.

“No, I didn’t hear anything specific.”

“You didn’t hear anything, but why does your face look like that?”

“What do you mean?”

“It looks like you find it obvious.”

“No way…”

“Anyway, I came to tell you to keep a close eye on Hyun-woo. And wait a little longer.”

“Wait a little longer? What do you mean?”

“It means I’ll be announcing my marriage first. So just wait a little longer. Understand?”

“Ah…”

Kim Ah-young nodded.

Inside, she felt oddly pleased.

‘Seeing oppa talk like this, it’s clear he had a conversation with our father.’

She noticed that lately, father and son were having more frequent conversations.

Perhaps it was about Hyun-woo?

‘So they knew we were dating and pretended not to for this reason.’

She realized she had misunderstood.

It was clear they knew she and Lee Hyun-woo were dating, but didn’t mention it because they didn’t think much of the other family.

‘Phew, I finally feel a bit relieved.’

Although she had to be careful about media exposure, she felt much more at ease.

Of course, even so, she continued to help her future father-in-law’s business discreetly for Lee Hyun-woo’s pride.

* * *

Lee Hyun-woo was more actively helping his father’s business than Kim Ah-young.

For this, he finally purchased a plane ticket to the U.S. at the end of the month and immediately went to his father’s company to inform him.

But then,

“Even though it’s for a business trip, I feel sorry for your mother since you’re going to the U.S.”

His father’s voice made Lee Hyun-woo’s heart sink.

“I’m more sorry. My younger brother and I have been traveling around so much. I should’ve sent you and mom on a trip…”

“There wasn’t time for that. As you know, not only were you busy, but we were busy with our work too.”

“Still, I should’ve paid more attention. I guess I’m still immature.”

“The fact that you can say that means you’ve matured. Honestly, your mother and I are very happy to have sons like you and Jung-woo. Ahem, ahem.”

It seemed he needed to clear his throat to hide his embarrassment since he wasn’t used to saying such things.

But Lee Hyun-woo still felt uneasy.

‘Come to think of it, growing the clothing company is my father’s dream, not my mother’s.’

Recently, he had been doing filial duties in the right direction, but he suddenly realized he had been focusing on one person.

“Dad, I’m curious, what’s mom’s dream?”

“Your mom? That’s… for you guys to grow up well. I think it’s already been achieved.”

“Haha…”

He realized all men are the same.

‘How can he be so indifferent to his wife?’

Could it really be that his mother’s only dream was for her children to grow up well?

“Not that, but something she’s always wanted or deeply desired… isn’t there anything like that?”

“Lately, with the generous living expenses you’ve provided, I’ve told her to buy nice clothes or jewelry if she wants.”

“Oh no, that should’ve been your treat, dad.”

“I would’ve liked to, but as you know, I was busy.”

“……”

He knew his father was indifferent, but he didn’t realize it was this bad.

He suddenly felt sorry for his mother.

She had spent her entire life for her husband and children, never living for herself.

‘I can’t let this continue.’

Equally fulfilling his parents’ wishes is basic filial duty.

Since he had been assisting his father’s dreams recently, he decided to find out his mother’s dreams and fulfill them too.

With this thought, he asked his mother that evening.

“Mom.”

“Yes?”

“What’s your dream?”

“Me?”

“Yes, something you’ve always wanted to do or have, either from the past or for the future. Please tell me.”

His mother looked at him curiously.

“This kid, why so suddenly…”

“Come on, just tell me.”

“What is there to tell? I already mentioned it before.”

“Huh?”

“A daughter-in-law. At least seeing the face of your girlfriend. That’s my dream. I’ve been waiting endlessly…”

“……!”

Lee Hyun-woo was taken aback.

He recalled that he had indeed asked his parents about their wishes on Parents’ Day.

His mother had expressed a strong desire for a daughter-in-law more than his father, and even if not that, she wanted to see who he was dating.

“You said you were dating someone. So when will you show her to me?”

“Ah… yes… soon…”

“When soon? You’ll soon be going to the U.S. again, you’ll be busy when you return, and then it’ll be Chuseok… I’d like to see her before that…”

“Mom… besides that, didn’t you have any other dreams? You must have had a dream when you were young?”

“You rascal, don’t change the subject. I’ll tell you later about that, but since you asked, you should grant my wish first, right?”

“……”

Lee Hyun-woo felt it was a big problem.

‘What should I do?’

He looked to his silent younger brother for help, but the kid was just snickering quietly.

He was annoyed.

But how would Lee Hyun-woo react if he knew what his younger brother Lee Jung-woo did shortly after?

“Sister-in-law? It’s me. Actually, my mom wants to see your face again.”
