Choi Sun-hwa's face lit up with a smile after receiving advice.

“I should be giving you well-wishes, but it feels quite nice to be on the receiving end.”

“Especially when expanding into Hong Kong or Taiwan, if you use Clones and Kim Yoon-sun as advertising models, it will sell even better.”

“Really? Well, I'll keep that in mind.”

This kid still can't foresee the Hallyu wave.

Thinking this to himself, Lee Hyun-woo had a meaningful expression.

To be precise, amid this busy period, he was dreaming of expanding 【Jungle】 into China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, following their entry into Japan.

‘Might as well do it all at once, right?’

To put it more accurately, he believed it would be okay to expand into neighboring countries, trusting in the power of the Hallyu wave.

Thinking this far, Lee Hyun-woo slightly shook his head.

‘Let's think about this later.’

It was time to wrap up the opening or expansion ceremony.

* * *

The after-party was held lavishly on the basement floor.

With the twirling lights, Clones danced.

Also, due to many urgings, Kim Yoon-sun had no choice but to showcase her talent.

Lee Hyun-woo also went out and shook his body, but when he returned to his seat, he had to face criticism from Oh Min-woo.

“CEO, your dancing hasn’t improved at all.”

In that case, he should at least sing well, but his singing was barely above the level of being tone-deaf.

Maybe because it was embarrassing to listen to, Kim Yoon-sun gave him some advice.

“Hyun-woo, shouldn’t you pick a song that matches your key?”

“Is that so? I just really like your song.”

For reference, Lee Hyun-woo sang Kim Yoon-sun’s debut song, ‘Tonight.’

“Then how about you pick one for me?”

“Hold on. Oh? This one seems good.”

“City Pierrot?”

“Don’t you know this song?”

“No, I know it, but I've never sung it before. I’ll give it a try.”

Kim Yoon-sun also had a song titled Pierrot.

Lee Hyun-woo was actually more drawn to that, but since this song was said to suit him better, he chose it and waited.

However, Yoo Jin-young was energetically singing a Candyboy song, so Lee Hyun-woo was secretly worried.

‘I hope I don't ruin the upbeat mood.’

Just by listening, it was clear that City Pierrot had a completely contrasting vibe.

I love you! That's what I said!

He didn't know it, but Yoo Jin-young could sing and rap well.

Because of that, his confidence dropped even further, but when it was his turn, people did not hold back their encouragement.

“It’s the CEO!”

“Please sing to the end this time~”

Earlier, he couldn’t hit the high notes and only sang the first verse, so he could hear the female employees asking him to sing to the end.

Will it really be like that?

‘Even if I hit the high notes well this time, I might stop because of the mood.’

As soon as the prelude began, it was indeed a downer.

He noticed the remaining people talking as if they weren’t interested in his song.

It was rather fortunate.

Lee Hyun-woo could also immerse himself in the song without caring.

Finally, as he started,

“Even if you walk aimlessly~ with a melancholy heart~”

Having lived through 50 years and being reincarnated again, the lyrics soaked into Lee Hyun-woo’s heart.

Because of that, he put more emotion into it, and before he knew it, he was singing with his eyes closed.

After the song ended, he thought that this was indeed the perfect song for him.

But it seemed he wasn’t the only one who thought so.

Before he knew it, many people were clapping.

“Wooooooo!”

“You sing well!”

When he returned to his seat, the reactions of those seated were also very positive.

“Your bass is no joke! It’s attractive.”

“You should have sung this from the beginning.”

“You sing better than me.”

“Honestly, we’re not that good at singing.”

Lastly, there was a compliment from Clones.

‘Bass songs suit me?’

Lee Hyun-woo thought he should focus on singing those kinds of songs from now on.

But in truth, there weren’t that many bass songs.

He didn’t even know what the singer of City Pierrot was doing now.

‘Is it because he didn't earn much?’

As he thought about investing in such singers later, his stream of consciousness led to the music industry.

To be precise, the digital music industry.

‘The MP3 era is about to begin, so I need to prepare in advance.’

He thought he should subtly mention the arrival of MP3s to someone close.

“Yoon-sun.”

“Yeah?”

“In the future, there will come a day when songs are bought one by one. I’m telling you to prepare for that in advance.”

“Okay, got it.”

As always, Kim Yoon-sun’s absent-minded voice and thoughtless answer flowed out.

It was Go Joon-hyup of Clones who showed interest instead.

“Selling songs one by one? But wouldn’t making CDs and tapes cost too much?”

“Joon-hyup, you’re the same age as me, right?”

“What? Oh, yeah… that’s right.”

“Then I saw you earlier than Yoon-sun, so should we drop the formalities and be friends?”

“Haha… You’re straightforward. Sure, let’s do that.”

Today alone, he had made two friends of the same age.

Thinking this, he glanced at the friend he made earlier in the afternoon.

Kim Ah-young was diligently discussing something.

They said it was about the duty-free shop, but Kim Ah-young didn’t seem interested.

Lee Hyun-woo turned his gaze back to Go Joon-hyup and began to speak.

“Of course, it’s impossible to put just one song on a CD or tape and sell it.”

“Then?”

“They will be downloaded.”

“Downloaded?”

“Yes, downloaded.”

“I don’t quite get it.”

“Let me give you an example. Let’s say you make a song and upload it to the internet. To download this, people would pay 100 won.”

“Is that possible?”

“We’re working on it now. Actually, we checked yesterday, and it’s making a lot of progress. It might even come out within this year.”

“Is that good for us?”

“It could be good or bad. Because, assuming the download fee is 100 won, a market where far more people can buy it than before will open. Nowadays, our site gets hundreds of thousands of visits, right? Imagine if 10% of these music lovers download your song. That’s hundreds of thousands of won a day. Hundreds of thousands of won per song. What if you have ten songs? And for someone like Yoon-sun, combining her old songs, it would be enormous.”

“Do you think those will sell?”

“Of course. I think they will.”

It was hard for someone who hadn’t experienced the future to grasp.

So Lee Hyun-woo tried to convey it in the easiest way possible, even for Kim Yoon-sun who had interjected.

“Moreover, the internet can connect countries. Yoon-sun’s songs were popular in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Also, those are Chinese-speaking regions, so if China gets proper internet infrastructure and can download your songs? Do you know how big the population of China is?”

“Uh….”

“Furthermore, if we expand into the biggest music markets like the US and Japan?”

“……”

“My dream might sound too far-fetched, but I think it’s fully achievable. The problem is the negative aspect.”

“What is it?”

“Remember when Clones’ song spread like wildfire on ‘Gil Board’?”

“Ugh, thinking about that makes me angry. Honestly, our song was a huge hit to the point where anyone and everyone was singing it, but because of illegal copies…”

“Exactly. That’s why you couldn’t earn more. The same goes for this. Actually, as I mentioned earlier, the transmission speed is faster, so illegal copying will also be faster. At that time, laws will be important. Laws that protect intellectual property.”

As he went on, he felt he was going too far.

People were starting to lose interest.

‘Well, they’ll only feel it when they experience it.’

With a helpless expression, Lee Hyun-woo smiled gently and finished the conversation.

Honestly, these kinds of talks are more comfortable with developers.

Or?

‘Haven’t they left yet?’

Earlier, seniors Jung Ji-hoon and CEO Jung Sung-woo from 【Alpha Cast】 had come, so he stood up to see if they were still around.

Soon, he spotted the Jung duo.

Whether by fate or coincidence, they were talking with Jang Yoo-chul.

Lee Hyun-woo picked up a beer mug and approached them.

“Oh? CEO?”

“Please have a seat here.”

“Hyun-woo, your singing was no joke earlier.”

“What serious discussion are you having?”

“Oh, just… Team Leader Jang was giving some advice, and that…”

Senior Jung Ji-hoon’s face had a subtle glow as he slightly stuttered his words.

Lee Hyun-woo then looked at Jang Yoo-chul.

Jang Yoo-chul soon spoke as if explaining.

“They said they were planning to make a CD player… I was a bit against it.”

“Oh… that?”

“Yes, but the CEO talked about investment. That doesn’t seem right.”

“I did say that.”

“Really?”

“But I agree with Team Leader Jang. I suggested an investment but hoped they would create something else.”

“Right?”

Listening to our conversation, Jung Ji-hoon and Jung Sung-woo exchanged glances.

Then CEO Jung Sung-woo asked first.

“What do you mean by something else?”

“Preparing for the end of the CD player era by creating a new player.”

“A new player?”

“Curious? If you’re interested, please visit us sometime. I can only say this much for now since it’s a bit serious for a drinking session.”

This wasn’t just for confidentiality.

Like earlier with Clones and Kim Yoon-sun, no one seriously listened to his story.

Perhaps these two would be similar.

So, he had no choice but to let them hear the MP3 files themselves and make the MP3 player that succeeded in his previous life.

“Then I’ll visit soon.”

“Please do.”

CEO Jung Sung-woo, who showed interest by saying he would visit.

Depending on how soon he came, the development of the MP3 player might be accelerated.

‘Anyway, today, I did so much that my reincarnation life values were infringed upon.’

He advocated for maintaining a balance between work and life, but today was a day when they got mixed up.

Although he enjoyed it, he kept approaching it as business.

So, at an appropriate time, Lee Hyun-woo decided to enjoy the drinks and dancing and then head home.

“Alright, it’s regrettable, but it’s already heading towards midnight. For tomorrow’s sake, let’s end here today.”

Since many people were still present, he made sure to say goodbye to each one.

Then, he took a taxi with his younger brother,

“Today, I realized once again how amazing you are, bro.”

His younger brother shared his thoughts.

“Amazing, my foot.”

“Really. Including the successor of 【Kusung Group】, there were three chaebol heirs, and representatives or executives from various companies came. Even celebrities wished for our company’s future.”

“Well, they’re just people I met by chance.”

“You’re meeting Son Jung-ui in a few days. Watching you rise higher and higher, it doesn’t feel real. That such a person is my brother.”

“I’m not going up alone. I’m going up with you. To be precise, with our company members.”

“Strictly speaking, you’re leading us. To uncharted territories that no one knew about. Yoo-chul’s words from earlier are still echoing in my mind.”

“What did he say?”

“He said the real Nostradamus is you.”
