Lee Jung-woo, the younger brother, watched the situation with interest and muttered.

"Two suppliers... Kim Yoon-soo must be really nervous."

"No matter what anyone says, I'm on Kim Yoon-soo's side."

Jang Yoo-cheol quickly added.

Lee Hyun-woo had been observing, and he noticed that this guy was very sentimental.

Although not to that extent, Lee Hyun-woo also hoped that Kim Yoon-soo's products would sell more.

If it weren't for 【One PC】 in the early stages of 【Jungle】, it wouldn't have grown so quickly.

'Kim must be glued to his computer screen all day watching the auction. By now, he must have noticed.'

Was that why?

Shortly after, Lee Hyun-woo's pager beeped.

Looking at the number, as expected, it was 【One PC】.

One might wonder if such a day would never come.

In fact, in a fiercely competitive society, it was bound to happen.

'He must be nervous.'

For a moment, he tried to judge the current situation from Kim Yoon-soo's perspective.

There are two types of people trying to dominate the business market.

One is the pioneers who take risks and venture into uncharted territories with creativity that no one else can think of.

The other is the fast followers who quickly enter the blue ocean pioneered by someone else and catch up rapidly.

If 【One PC】 inadvertently became the first type, given Kim Yoon-soo's business acumen, there was a high probability that he would be overtaken by the second type of people.

So, should such a person always suffer?

'Looking at his character, he seems like a good person.'

That wouldn't be right.

To be honest, he wanted to help.

Suddenly, he remembered the high-ranking reaper he met before he died.

And the words he said to Lee Hyun-woo.

【Good deeds are always rewarded, aren't they?】

Others might not understand, but for Lee Hyun-woo, who had died once and was reborn, these were not just words to be ignored.

'I have to help him.'

With this thought, Lee Hyun-woo decided to visit him in person instead of calling.

On his way, he planned several strategies for Kim Yoon-soo.

Most of them were business strategies starting from establishing the relationship between 【One PC】 and 【Jungle】.

Considering Kim Yoon-soo's personality, it was clear that once a connection was made, he would be a great help to Lee Hyun-woo and 【Jungle】.

In that case, 【Jungle】 should focus on mutual revenue growth rather than cost-saving measures with 【One PC】.

As a former deputy manager of the corporate planning department of a large company, Lee Hyun-woo had made outsourcing-related decisions more than once. Thus, he defined 【One PC】 not as a 'procurement relationship' but as a 'partner relationship.'

With these thoughts in mind, he finally arrived at 【One PC】.

Was Kim Yoon-soo waiting for him?

As soon as he saw Lee Hyun-woo, who was wandering outside, he spoke excitedly.

"Hey, did you see 【Strawberry PC】?"

"Yes, I saw it."

"Ah, it's annoying."

"It seems to be located nearby."

"Damn, there's no guarantee that other places won't do the same, right?"

"The more my website becomes known, the more it will happen everywhere."

"Then what about me?"

Kim Yoon-soo looked anxious.

For now, Lee Hyun-woo mentioned the benefits he was receiving.

"We are already offering you a special lower commission rate."

"I appreciate that."

Unlike the 2.5% commission at other places, the commission for products listed by 【One PC】 is 2.3%.

"But will that be a big help in the future? Apart from the commission, the competition is getting fierce, and there's a higher chance of selling less than before."

"There is a bigger way to help."

"What is it?"

"Set up your own PC assembly company."

"……!"

This was the solution Lee Hyun-woo had thought of on his way.

The problem was that no matter how easily influenced Kim Yoon-soo was, this wasn't an easy decision.

Who would easily decide to start a new PC company?

"I'm not suggesting that you set up a PC assembly plant right away. But let's consider it as a preparation for when competition becomes fierce. In other words, with supply limitations in the future, let's think about mass production and significantly lowering prices."

"But... that would cost a lot of money."

As expected, Kim Yoon-soo's eyes trembled.

Then Lee Hyun-woo asked him in a more serious tone than before.

"Where do the computers you list for auction come from?"

"Well... right."

"Then those PC assembly companies are also ordering and producing the core components."

"That's right. The place I mainly deal with is small, but they seem to be doing it that way."

Frequenting Yongsan, he understood the structure.

Some places assemble and sell PCs themselves, while people like Kim Yoon-soo get supplies from places that source components from Yongsan or Sewoon Market.

In such cases, places like 【One PC】 could fall behind in price competitiveness later.

That's why he suggested.

"Try the same method. Source the components and assemble them."

"Source... the same way?"

"I guarantee that in a few years, there will be an enormous demand for PCs. To a point where the current situation won't even compare. So, it wouldn't be a bad idea to start a large-scale assembly PC business in advance."

"Hmm..."

"I'm not forcing you. Business always comes with risks."

Broadly speaking, affordable PCs needed to come out quickly for Lee Hyun-woo's website to succeed.

However, he lacked the capital and his goal of making a profit in the middle would become vague.

So, the proposals were bound to be radical.

"Reduce the cost, including labor, to around 600,000 won, and go for a 1 million won affordable PC. If you do that, I will sell those PCs at a fixed price instead of an auction. How about that?"

For Lee Hyun-woo, the auction site was just a step towards online shopping.

What if he could hold both 【E Base】 and 【Amazoness】 to sell everything in the world?

Also, he wanted to help Kim Yoon-soo, with whom he had formed a connection.

Of course, from Kim Yoon-soo's perspective, Lee Hyun-woo might seem reckless,

'How can I say that I know the future?'

The demand for computers, which started in 1996, is enormous.

If his goal was manufacturing, he would want to jump in immediately.

He had no choice but to put on a confident face and said,

"It's a big decision, so you might need some time. Think it over and decide later."

"Yes, I should. But how much would it cost?"

Lee Hyun-woo was surprised that he didn't seem to be thinking deeply.

He quickly asked, wondering if he was being imprudent.

"Are you rich by any chance?"

"I'm not, but my father has some money. It's not hard to persuade him since sales have been improving recently."

"……!"

At that moment, Lee Hyun-woo saw a signal in his eyes that he had found a reliable investor.

If done right, couldn't it be a win-win?

* * *

That day, Lee Hyun-woo had a drink for the first time in a while.

Thinking about it, he hadn't drunk alcohol since his return.

'No, I don't even remember when I drank before my return.'

In the life of a workaholic, there was nothing but work.

In that sense, the second life should be enjoyed a bit, but now it seemed he was already showing signs of work addiction.

Even now, he was drinking with Kim Yoon-soo because of work.

'I'll think about work-life balance a bit later.'

He gulped down the drink and tried to persuade Kim Yoon-soo with more conviction.

"Ah! It's bitter. So, sir, think about it carefully. The direction of our country's industry has always been like a pot. It boils over once and then cools down. Now is the era of computers. Aren't you experiencing it firsthand?"

"I know, I know. That's why I paid a lot of money to get into Yongsan Electronics Market."

"You even paid a lot of money?"

"I had no choice. I had to prove myself to my father."

It wasn't something he could casually ask about someone else's family issues.

He could only guess that he was a rich man's son who needed to prove his abilities to receive proper inheritance later.

Fortunately, after a few more drinks, he started talking about himself.

"My father was a loan shark, as they say. He made a lot of money with daily interest loans. My older brother learned the business early by following my father around, and somehow, he invested all the accounts he had created under borrowed names into companies just before the real-name financial system was implemented. And now, whether listed or not, most of those companies have become very successful, proving his abilities."

"He's quite capable."

"Yes, I admit it. But I was always compared to him."

"Is he your only sibling?"

"I also have a much younger sister. She’s smart too."

"I see."

"Anyway, the companies my brother invested in are no joke. Han Gil Group, Yulim Group, Jin Sang Group, Sam In Food, Doma Department Store, Taemyung Food, Shin Han Construction, Aju Motors, Joseon Securities, Wang Bang Wool, Center Department Store..."

He didn't know how long he would go on, but most of the companies he mentioned would go bankrupt during the financial crisis.

Unaware, he kept expressing his inferiority complex.

"So, it was inevitable to be compared. To overcome that, I started various businesses, but they all failed. Eventually, when I said I would at least run an electronics market in Yongsan, I can still remember the pitying look in my father's eyes. I told him I wouldn't see him again until I succeeded."

"So, you haven't seen him yet?"

"No, he came to see me recently. He used to treat me like a disowned child, but maybe he felt sorry for me working diligently. He gave me some words of encouragement, saying he heard good things about me lately."

"Does your father have intelligence like the National Intelligence Service?"

"He must've had someone observe me. He probably figured out that I'm not doing business well. And he must've investigated that I met you and that sales have been rising recently."

"Oh? Then I must've been investigated too?"

"I don't know about that, but knowing my father's personality, he probably checked you out. It's hard to blame him since I've been deceived so many times."

"Oh…."

Listening, Lee Hyun-woo couldn't help but nod.

From his experience, Kim Yoon-soo was easily swayed.

He grew up wealthy and didn't know lack but had enough kindness not to harm others.

"Can I give you some harsh advice?"

"I'm not suited for business?"

"You know it."

"How many people do you think have told me that? I know. But as I keep saying, it's hard to let go of the desire to be recognized by my father."

If he brought Lee Jung-woo here, he would probably understand Kim Yoon-soo's words 120%.

'That guy was like that in his previous life too.'

He used to get drunk and say in a gloomy voice that he always felt compared to the capable Lee Hyun-woo.

Although he was much older than his current self, he felt like he was seeing his younger brother from his previous life, making him feel more inclined to help.

Moreover, he was confident that he could make the assembly PC business successful.

"Then take the challenge."

"Really? Can I do it?"

"I'll help you. I can't guarantee huge success, but I can prevent failure."
