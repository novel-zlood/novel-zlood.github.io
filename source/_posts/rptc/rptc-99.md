The recent writings of Nostradamus have caused a great stir.

『Nostradamus predicts the overseas escape of 【Bohan Group】 executives this time?』

『What kind of company is 【Gukdong Gas】 mentioned by Nostradamus?』

『The asset value of 【Gukdong Gas】, which purchased shares in the Siberian gas field in Russia, is over 50 million dollars』

The media environment has certainly been changing these days.

Media outlets access portal sites, acquire information, then produce articles through coverage and interviews.

Moreover, by utilizing mobile communication and high-speed internet, they can communicate with the higher-ups holding editorial rights and sometimes quickly upload articles, adding more enjoyment to Lee Hyun-woo's newspaper reading.

'Wow, it's only been 24 hours since it was posted, but there are already three articles.'

The next day, several articles were published, and one of them had the most accurately investigated content.

『…(omitted)… Therefore, Chairman Han Jung-soo of 【Bohan Group】 continued the methods he had been using in Korea in Russia. In other words, he identified the 'vein of money' ahead of others through a business operation method that inevitably had to be connected with power. And this brought great success. Among the national assets privatized, he secured shares in the Siberian gas field.

Chairman Han's ability to discover future resources as a businessman was certainly exceptional. After all, investing in Russian resources was virtually the first time for our country. The value of 【Gukdong Gas】, which holds shares in the gas field, is bound to soar over time. Therefore, Chairman Han Jung-soo, who has messed up the economic order through his connections with politics, must be prevented in advance from cashing out 【Gukdong Gas】 and fleeing abroad. …(omitted)…』

This seemed almost like it was recorded by someone from the inside.

'If the media starts to grasp this much, the prosecution and police won't stay still either.'

As expected, as soon as another day passed, articles from the prosecution poured out.

『Prosecution requests court to freeze domestic and international assets of 【Bohan Group】』

『Attempts by Chairman Han Jung-soo to sell 【Gukdong Gas】 detected』

In addition, his children were also banned from leaving the country, blocking any attempt to 'flee' with the money, much like in Lee Hyun-woo's previous life.

'It feels rewarding for no reason.'

Lee Hyun-woo, laughing while reading various related articles from the morning.

However, the media continued to cover Nostradamus.

『Nostradamus, who exactly is he?』

He wondered if he might be investigated by a national agency at this rate.

'I’ve been intentionally writing from an internet cafe these days.'

Lee Hyun-woo, writing and posting from an internet cafe between his workplace and his new home, just in case.

Still, thinking that he should be even more careful, he closed the window.

Now, he decided to leave 【Bohan Group】 to the prosecution and the media.

Anyway, it was time for the meeting, so Lee Hyun-woo left the CEO's office.

* * *

However, it was harder not to pay attention to the related situation.

Nostradamus was already quite famous within 【Jungle】.

Perhaps because of this, related conversations continued.

"Who could it be? Nostradamus?"

"I'm curious too. Maybe we could find out sneakily..."

Jang Yoo-chul, who said this much during the meeting, glanced at Lee Hyun-woo.

He realized his mistake because Lee Hyun-woo was very thorough when it came to personal information protection.

"Okay, excessive interest is not good. Especially for us, who handle personal information, we need to be even more careful. Got it?"

"Yes, CEO."

"I will keep that in mind."

"Rather than that, it might be better to predict and think about the aftermath of the incident. I'll take any opinions."

"……."

At Lee Hyun-woo's last words, everyone fell silent.

'What, why isn't anyone speaking?'

Originally, he didn't intend to discuss the related situation, but since the topic came up, he wanted to see their perspective on the impact of 【Bohan Group】 on the Korean economy.

If they realized that the financial sector would tighten, foreign exchange would shake, exchange rates would rise, and corporate bankruptcies would repeat due to this incident.

Or if they even mentioned the slightest sign of it.

It would be proof that the message Lee Hyun-woo sent to the main economic players in South Korea through Nostradamus's blog had partially worked.

'Was that too big of a hope?'

Only Oh Min-woo said,

"Well, won't 【Bohan Group】 be completely dismantled?"

He merely made a prediction that anyone could make.

Suddenly, Lee Hyun-woo realized.

'Without experiencing the future, it seems impossible to foresee even a step ahead.'

No matter how smart and economically insightful a person is, it's hard to predict what will happen.

At that moment.

"Looking at the most frequent words on the search engine these days, 'economic crisis' and 'bankruptcy' are overwhelming."

Hearing the words mentioned by Woo Sang-won, Lee Hyun-woo's eyes widened.

Not because of the content.

"Can you know the most frequent words?"

"Yes, our search engine is very smart. To be precise, Team Leader Oh Min-woo programmed it to output words searched more than 100 times a day."

This time, Lee Hyun-woo looked at Oh Min-woo without reducing his widened eyes.

Then the guy shrugged his shoulders.

"It was made during the process of working on 'relationships' and 'connections' that I mentioned last time. It can be useful in the future, but even I am not sure what to do with it…."

"Make a search term ranking."

"Sorry?"

"Make a daily search term ranking. Display what people using our portal site are most interested in, from the first to the tenth place."

"Oh… that sounds fun."

It's more than just fun.

Through the search term ranking, one could quickly grasp the latest trends.

'Is this also the result of creating a good search engine?'

Lee Hyun-woo was increasingly getting drawn into the charm of the search engine.

"Then Team Leader Oh can continue with his work, and Team Leader Woo, can you create this? I think it would be good to update it daily at the top of the first page."

"Yes, I will do that."

【Jungle】 continues to evolve day by day like this.

* * *

Near the end of the workday, Woo Sang-won visited Lee Hyun-woo to show him the results.

"You've already made it?"

"Just had to apply the already designed algorithm."

"I see."

"If you open the screen, I'll explain it right away."

They could have taken more time, so why the rush?

Noticing Lee Hyun-woo's gaze that included this meaning, Woo Sang-won asked awkwardly.

"Do I seem hasty?"

"Yes."

"Our company doesn't allow overtime, so I got a bit hurried."

Lee Hyun-woo smiled bitterly.

How ironic.

Since reducing working hours from this year, the miracle of speeding up work to resolve it within the hours was happening.

"If you look, there's a way to display the ranking by moving sideways one by one and another way by moving up."

"I'll go with the latter."

Maybe because he was used to it from the future, it seemed more natural for the search terms to move up.

"Then I will apply it from tomorrow."

"Do so. Oh, just one more thing."

"Yes?"

"If you can do this, can you also create related search terms?"

"Related search terms?"

"Yes, simply put, when you search for 【Bohan Group】, the chairman Han Jung-soo or 【Gukdong Gas】 would also appear together."

"Oh… yes, I think I can do that."

"Take your time with this one, as it will need time."

"No, it won't take much time. Team Leader Oh designed the 'relationship' algorithm brilliantly. We combined it with the filtering technology developed by Team Leader Lee."

"Filtering technology?"

"These days, a lot of unnecessary things come up. Swear words, erotic novels, etc. Finding and deleting them one by one is also a task, so we made them catch on the search terms from the beginning."

Understanding at once, Lee Hyun-woo's eyes widened.

'Is it that our company attracts talented individuals, or does the environment nurture them?'

Perhaps the combination of the former and the latter was creating these genius developers.

Woo Sang-won in front of him was no different.

"I will simulate the search term ranking for a few days and then work on the related search terms right away."

"Do so."

Although lacking in something that shines compared to the two geniuses, he performs the given tasks flawlessly.

If everyone grows like this,

'My retirement might come sooner.'

Feeling good for no reason, he chuckled.

* * *

Though it was a different kind of laugh, when Lee Hyun-woo accessed the internet at home, breaking news about the 【Bohan Incident】 popped up.

The court accepted the prosecution's request to freeze assets.

'Oh, 60 million dollars are secured.'

Moreover, this fund would grow even more if left untouched.

Now, 【Gukdong Gas】 would likely be managed by the Industrial Bank or the Export-Import Bank during the dismantling process of 【Bohan Group】.

Of course, it would go through a tedious process.

Just reading articles about what needs to be revealed through Chairman Han Jung-soo of 【Bohan Group】's hearing made him sigh.

'Several bank presidents, politicians, and officials will end up in jail.'

Speaking of politicians, he thought of that person.

The one who embezzled a lot while being president.

'Since it's come to this, should I write about that person's hidden assets on the blog?'

People who always stayed at the top of the penalty ranks kept lingering in his mind.

It itched to reveal the hidden assets of a former president who showed no remorse.

'But I can't do that on the blog.'

This time, he took out the names of a few people managing the dictator's hidden assets under pseudonyms and printed them.

Then, he neatly placed the printouts in an envelope and sent it to a journalist at a media outlet the next day on his way to work.

He felt inexplicably satisfied.

'Unlike the previous life, I will pay a lot of taxes in this life, so I'll make sure there are no people who embezzle my hard-earned money.'

Moreover, the former president was an unforgivable person who took money from elementary school children as donations when Lee Hyun-woo was a kid.

Lee Hyun-woo intended to cooperate as much as possible to ensure that such people’s ill-gotten money was returned to the national treasury.

'This is the true taste of reincarnation.'

Seeing Lee Hyun-woo chuckling for no reason when he arrived at work that day, people couldn't help but tilt their heads in confusion.

The mental state of a genius could flow in unpredictable directions.

So, worried, Lee Jung-woo came and asked.

"Hyung, is there a problem?"

"Oh, no. I'm fine. Why?"

"Ah, I see. People were worried because you've been laughing all day."

"Just remembered something funny."

"What is it?"

"I can't tell you."

It's hard to reveal now.

And it would be the same in the future.

Even if the media outlet properly investigates and breaks the news as an exclusive, how could he say that Lee Hyun-woo provided the precise and detailed information?

'No matter how I think about it, there's something enjoyable only a reincarnator can have.'

So the world must be lived twice to be understood.
