"“The comments are going crazy, aren't they?”

“Yeah, there are more comments from people who couldn't buy it.”

“Everyone is writing that they hope the pre-orders increase.”

“You said more pre-orders are possible, right?”

“You mentioned it last time.”

“But, CEO, can't my favorite hip-hop group 'Double' do it this way? I want to be the first to order their next album.”

Eugene slipped in her personal desire at the end.

Feeling good, how could I not answer her?

“Of course, you can do it. But Han Se-jin works at their agency, so ask Han Se-jin for help.”

Han Se-jin was the only one not present at the moment.

He had gone to 【Nine Sound】 to check the progress of the live album.

While at the celebration, excluding him, Lee Hyun-woo thought for a moment.

‘This can only be considered luck.’

【Jungle】, which was already on a winning streak,

Now that it’s getting newspaper and TV coverage, it feels like some high-ranking official from the afterlife I saved before dying is looking after me, he even mused ‘fantastically’.

Around this time, Han Se-jin returned from 【Nine Sound】.

And Hong Dong-wook, the head of the PR team, conveyed the news that ten thousand pre-orders for the album were sold, which left him astounded.

“When will the album be released?”

“It'll take another 1-2 weeks, but they're trying to hurry it up.”

Demand always speeds up all supply.

Especially in our country, this speed is at a world-class level.

It’s not because the country is small, but perhaps due to cultural characteristics.

Of course, I’m not a scholar, so I don’t know where this cultural trait originates from, but the culture of getting things done, and faster, was deeply reflected in business.

Isn’t this the background for the uniquely developed information and communication technology that emphasizes ‘speed’?

‘Then I should push even harder.’

The next day, Lee Hyun-woo visited 【Nine Sound】 once again.

* * *

Seeing Lee Hyun-woo visiting for two consecutive days, Hong Dong-wook showed a puzzled expression.

“I came because I'm in a hurry. The server is about to explode.”

“The server is about to explode? Why?”

“The comments asking to add more pre-orders for Shin Sung-hoon's live album are overwhelming. Have you checked this?”

“Ah, yes. Of course, I'm aware.”

It seemed Hong Dong-wook was frequently checking 【Jungle】 now.

With this, Lee Hyun-woo spoke with more determination in his voice.

“The response is better than I thought. Since he's a very popular singer, it seems to be selling well online too.”

“This is the first time I’ve seen such a hot online response. The CEO also pays attention every day.”

“Then the album release?”

“The CEO went to the record production company himself. He’ll probably bring good news.”

“That’s a relief. I was worried about what to say to the customers, but now we can set the release date for a week from now.”

“Ah, let's decide that after the CEO returns.”

“Okay, understood. By the way, it seems we need to add another ten thousand orders. I think we can easily sell another ten thousand at this rate.”

“Probably.”

“Then about the verbal agreement we made last time…”

Lee Hyun-woo reminded Hong Dong-wook of the verbal agreement they made last time.

The agreement to supply 【Jungle】 with an additional ten thousand units at 5,900 won each instead of 6,000 won.

Though the price reduction might reduce profits, from 【Nine Sound】's perspective, selling ten thousand units even before the album was released was welcome news.

Hong Dong-wook nodded in agreement.

“Of course, we can do that.”

“Thank you.”

“We should be the ones thanking you. Honestly, it's beyond our expectations. It seems like the next album from our company should definitely be with 【Jungle】.”

“Who’s the next album by? If it’s Kim Geun-mo, that would be great.”

“Ah, he won’t be doing the next album with us.”

“Oh? Really?”

“Instead, it’s a rookie singer’s album coming out.”

Upon hearing the term ‘rookie singer’, Lee Hyun-woo's intuition kicked in.

At this time, 【Nine Sound】 held a status similar to future Big 3 entertainment companies.

So, he had no choice but to ask directly.

“Can you tell me who the rookie singer is?”

“You wouldn't know even if I told you…”

“I wouldn’t know, which is why we can help with the promotion.”

“That’s true. Ah, I really need to get closer to the CEO?”

Hong Dong-wook’s eyes sparkled.

Given the limited media to promote rookie singers at this time, Hong Dong-wook thought that as 【Jungle】 gained more power, it would become indispensable.

For rookie singers, the break-even point is ten thousand units.

Thus, to help out, he quickly mentioned the singer's name and asked for promotional help.

“They used to help famous singers with choreography. The name is ‘Clones’.”

“……!”

This time, Lee Hyun-woo was surprised.

‘As expected…’

If it’s Clones, their debut song was a mega-hit that even dogs and cows could follow.

At the early company dinners at 【Deokseong Trading】, Lee Hyun-woo often sang it to liven up the atmosphere, so just hearing it now made him hum it inwardly.

‘Kungdari Sha-ba-ra... Papapa!’

How could he miss securing an album guaranteed to succeed?

It was like ignoring a high-denomination bill found on the street.

Calming himself down, Lee Hyun-woo made the following request.

“Can I listen to the song later?”

“Well, the song will be released soon, so you can listen to it even now.”

“Really?”

“Do you really want to hear it?”

“Of course. It’s a rookie singer from 【Nine Sound】, isn't it? Since success is guaranteed, I have every reason to promote and sell it. Still, I need to verify…”

“If you insist…”

Wanting to maintain a good relationship with 【Jungle】, Hong Dong-wook easily agreed.

Popular singers might have been different, but rookie singers didn’t need to be kept secret.

Furthermore, with the album release just around the corner, it was the right time to find opportunities for exposure.

‘This is great. I’ll get a chance to promote.’

On the other hand, Lee Hyun-woo only needed to confirm if it was the song from his past life.

So, shortly after, he got to listen to the anticipated song,

Kungdari~ Sha-ba-ra~ Papapa!

‘That’s the song.’

Lee Hyun-woo’s face brightened.

Now, with no reason to hesitate, he confidently said,

“100,000 units.”

“What?”

“Give us 100,000 units for 【Jungle】.”

“CEO Lee, isn’t that a bit overconfident? Shin Sung-hoon sold that much because he’s an extremely popular singer.”

“Leave the selling to me, just give us 100,000 units. How about 5,000 won each?”

When Lee Hyun-woo first added 10,000 units, Hong Dong-wook was pleased, but now he frowned and tried to dissuade him.

“If I sell 100,000 units at 5,000 won each, the company will profit despite it not being a standard wholesale price, and I’ll be more recognized. But I’m telling you this because of our relationship, it’s a reckless move. Just go for 10,000 units. Even that might not be easy.”

“It’s okay, just give us 100,000 units. I got a feeling as soon as I heard it. It’s something I can’t explain with words.”

Of course, it had to be this way.

How could he explain reincarnation or knowing the future?

Lee Hyun-woo’s relaxed smile filled his lips again.

‘Just know that if I say I’ll sell 100,000 units, I will.’

Unlike Lee Hyun-woo, Hong Dong-wook frowned.

In his eyes, it seemed like a young man’s reckless greed might put him in trouble.

‘This could end badly.’

Finding a new sales route for albums was also a stroke of luck for Hong Dong-wook.

Thus, he hoped the 【Jungle】 website would do well and shared his life experience as advice to Lee Hyun-woo.

“I have a brother about your age at home. So don’t take this as nagging…”

“……”

“No matter how much you can return, doing it on such a large scale could be disastrous. Think it over again.”

“Thanks for your concern, but there won't be any returns. We can sell all 100,000 units.”

“Hmm…”

Seeing Lee Hyun-woo not budging, a sigh escaped from Hong Dong-wook.

‘Was I like this in the past?’

People who hadn't experienced major failures often took such reckless risks.

Hong Dong-wook recalled the singers he pushed during his early winning streak.

What was the result?

He tasted the bitterness of life back then.

It was something one couldn’t explain without experiencing it.

Thinking this far, Hong Dong-wook nodded with a knowing look.

“Then let's set a returnable amount. Is that okay?”

“Sounds good.”

“Exactly half. 50,000 units.”

“Alright, let's do it.”

5,000 won for 50,000 units amounted to a whopping 400 million won.

Seeing Lee Hyun-woo hastily agree, Hong Dong-wook frowned again.

If he had negotiated a bit more, he could have compromised, but seeing him readily accept, it seemed Lee Hyun-woo was really going to face a tough time.

“Phew, there's no helping it. Alright. But don’t regret it later.”

“Sure, but if we sell all 100,000 units, please frequently give us exclusive rights to sell concert and album tickets on our 【Jungle】 website.”

“Well… we’ll have to discuss that later, but in this industry, the top sellers are the kings. I’m sure you’ll have more influence than now.”

Whether Lee Hyun-woo noticed or not, the implication was that it was unlikely.

Quick-witted Lee Hyun-woo must have already understood the other’s intentions?

‘You must be baffled, right? But if we sell all of them later, you’ll be even more baffled.’

However, when he left 【Nine Sound】, Han Se-jin also had the same expression as Hong Dong-wook.

Since they had joined the company not long ago, they cautiously tried to dissuade him.

“Seems… a bit too much…”

With no way to explain, Lee Hyun-woo quietly smiled.

‘Jung-woo and Yoo-chul will be ecstatic.’

Sure enough, shortly after, they made faces ten times more bewildered than Hong Dong-wook’s and were at a loss for words.

“Hyung… I mean, President, even at 5,000 won, 100,000 units is 500 million won.”

“The down payment was set at 10 million won. I saw more than 10 million won in the account.”

“What if they don’t sell?”

“They will. Even faster than expected.”

“I’m really worried.”

“I’m worried too, but fortunately, they agreed to take returns if they don’t sell initially, so I’m a bit relieved.”

“Phew.”

As Han Se-jin added this, Lee Jung-woo sighed in relief,

“Not all, just 50,000 units.”

“What? No, CEO!”

“Lee Jung-woo, just trust me. Don’t worry about anything. Okay?”

“Still, how can we sell 50,000 units?”

“Lee Jung-woo, you don’t know, but every time I predicted hit songs by singers, I was right with a very high probability. I mean, if I said it would be a hit, it always was.”

“I’ve never heard that while living with you.”

“Because I said it inwardly.”

“……”

Again, a bewildered look.

As his younger brother, he was actively trying to dissuade him.

Knowing this, Lee Hyun-woo’s mind was busy calculating.

‘If we sell Shin Sung-hoon’s CD at the same 8,000 won, that would be 800 million won in revenue. After deducting shipping and labor costs, we’d make at least 100 million in profit.’"
