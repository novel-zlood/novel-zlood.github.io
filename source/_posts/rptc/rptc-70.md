Kim Tae-hyun widened his eyes at Lee Hyun-woo's refusal.

A sense of crisis surged at the thought of having to cancel the investment altogether.

So he asked without reducing the size of his eyes.

"Why?"

"It's hard to succeed greatly without involving a company based in Japan. Instead, I will lower Son Jung-ui's shares."

"If we lower Son Jung-ui's shares? What about our shares?"

"Basically, Hyungnim and Son Jung-ui's shares need to be over 51%. As you know, Japan has a considerable barrier against foreign companies."

"Of course. So we should go with Japan's 【Guseong】 investing."

As always, discussing shares is difficult.

Especially since you have to follow the laws of that country, you need to think quickly when having such conversations.

Kim Tae-hyun was no different now.

If his shares and Son Jung-ui's combined to 51%, and 【Jungle】's shares were 40%?

'Total 91%.'

Naturally, the remaining percentage belongs to Kim Ah-young.

"In conclusion, Ah-young can have a maximum of 9%."

"......"

"And I get 26%?"

"I'm sorry. The main operators should be 【Jungle Software】 and 【Software Bank】. Instead, you can just invest and stay back, later receiving profit dividends. Not a bad choice, right?"

"Hmm..."

Kim Tae-hyun let out a groan.

Honestly, it was hard to refute.

He was still amazed.

'This guy is really impressive.'

Kim Tae-hyun had already done some research on 【Jungle】 before visiting.

Although he had heard from his younger sister, Kim Ah-young, last time, exact figures are necessary to invest.

So he reviewed the reports that came up over the past few days and confirmed that even though Kim Ah-young's words were slightly exaggerated, it was definitely worth investing in.

Based on that information, he came today to have a conversation, and now he could understand the recent rapid growth of 【Jungle】.

He liked the strategy for entering the Japanese market and didn't find Lee Hyun-woo's words and actions, trying to take the initiative within that, too unpleasant.

It was proof that he was good at pushing and pulling.

So he nodded and concluded.

"Alright, I'm okay with it. Ah-young, what about you?"

"It's a bit disappointing, but it can't be helped. I'm okay with it too."

"Then the specific investment amount..."

"We haven't conducted a feasibility study yet, and we need to meet and discuss with Son Jung-ui. I'll let you know after that."

"......"

"......"

Once again, he was impressed.

If it were someone else, they would have been blinded by money and tried to get more right away, but Lee Hyun-woo showed no such signs.

If exaggerated a bit, it seemed like he was offering a place in a sure-to-succeed business.

Kim Tae-hyun liked this attitude as well, so he nodded with a smile.

"Alright. Let's meet again once we have a clearer direction."

"Not just the working-level staff?"

"No, I want to meet and talk with you directly. Preferably at a place I know. We can have some drinks then too."

At this point, Kim Ah-young intervened.

"Hey, oppa. Why are you leaving me out?"

"Do you want to be involved in everything? There are things men need to discuss and places we need to go."

"That's why I want to be involved. I'm worried you'll corrupt Hyun-woo."

"......"

"......"

Kim Tae-hyun was at a loss for words, and Lee Hyun-woo was too flabbergasted to speak.

Considering all the years he had lived through ups and downs, to think he would be corrupted now?

'From pure and innocent Ah-young's perspective, I guess I've already been quite corrupted...'

Even Lee Hyun-woo had not avoided or not received any hospitality in his previous life.

Of course, in his current life, he didn't particularly enjoy such practices anymore.

As always, what he wanted to try in this life were things he hadn't done in his previous one.

"Alright, let's conclude this tentatively for now. I have to go down and attend the opening ceremony."

At Lee Hyun-woo's words, the two others stood up as well.

"We'll stay and watch that. I saw someone bringing a pig's head earlier."

"We weren't planning to do it, but my mother insisted."

"Hahaha, you should listen to your mother. I always do. Anyway, you should put something in the pig's mouth."

Kim Tae-hyun's words sparked curiosity.

'I wonder how much a third-generation chaebol will spend.'

With this thought, they went down and saw that everything was already prepared on the first floor.

On a large table set up like an ancestral rite table, fruits, kimchi, and jeon (Korean pancakes) were laid out, and the pig greeted them with a smile.

Of course, there were quite a few people greeting Lee Hyun-woo.

Especially many business people, who were so diverse in their fields that it was hard to categorize them.

There were people from 【One Computer】, Yongsan store owners, heads of various record companies, and executives from the four major PC communications companies.

Even someone from 【Korea Electric Power Corporation】, where they had recently started active exchanges, came and widened his eyes upon seeing Kim Tae-hyun.

'The successor of 【Guseong Group】 came here?'

He felt that Lee Hyun-woo's network was no joke.

Another second-generation chaebol appeared.

It was Choi Sun-hwa from 【Aejeong Cosmetics】.

With the characteristic confidence of a second-generation chaebol, she approached Lee Hyun-woo and greeted him without caring about other people's eyes.

"Hello, CEO."

"Oh? You came?"

It was certainly busy.

Yet Lee Hyun-woo didn't forget to greet everyone individually.

Choi Sun-hwa was no exception.

And as she recognized familiar faces around Lee Hyun-woo, her eyes sparkled, and she opened her mouth.

"Oh? You two are here too."

"Yeah, you came?"

"Sun-hwa, long time no see."

"Yeah, it's been a while, oppa. How have you been?"

"Same as always."

Their conversation soon halted for the start of the ritual.

Not putting much importance on formality, Lee Hyun-woo bowed first.

But then.

"......"

No one stepped up next.

To be precise, it seemed they had to decide the next person based on the people's gazes.

Everyone was looking at Kim Tae-hyun.

'Yes, the son of the country's top chaebol should do it.'

'Right, if I step up recklessly, it might seem inappropriate.'

What kind of mindset was this?

Lee Hyun-woo smiled bitterly, but the successor of 【Guseong Group】 wasn't the type to shy away from this gesture.

Naturally, he stepped up as if it was his turn, bowed, and took out a yellowish check from his wallet.

He placed it in the pig's mouth.

Hearing people whispering, Lee Hyun-woo caught their words.

"How much is it?"

"It's hard to tell since all checks look similar..."

"I'm really curious. Since he's the successor of Guseong Group, it must be a lot."

Was it divine intervention to satisfy their curiosity?

The check didn't fit properly in the pig's mouth and fell to the floor, revealing the amount to a few sharp-eyed individuals.

"Gasp!"

"Ten million won..."

"Ten!"

Seeing the amount, quite a few people regretted not stepping up.

Now it was inevitable that the atmosphere would be burdensome.

As people hesitated to bow, they pointed to the next person with their eyes.

Of course, it was Kim Ah-young.

Kim Ah-young also placed a check of the same color in the pig's mouth.

Was it intentional?

The check fell again, catching people's eyes.

"Ten million won..."

"What should I do..."

Some sighed, and the third person was Choi Sun-hwa.

Although she was also a second-generation chaebol, she couldn't help but feel awkward in this situation.

'Why are they giving so much?'

But she couldn't hesitate forever, so she quickly took out checks and placed them in the pig's mouth.

Instead of one, she placed several.

Someone was counting them.

"One, two, three, four..."

Seeing her careful not to let them fall, people guessed it wasn't ten million won.

'Eh, it doesn't compare.'

Even though she placed four checks of one million won each, it felt lacking, making her feel unfair.

If Choi Sun-hwa felt this way, how would others feel?

Some went outside to get checks, while others rolled up ten-thousand-won checks and stuck them in the pig's nose and ears.

Even though it was ten thousand won, they felt embarrassed for others to see it.

As this commotion occurred, Lee Hyun-woo quickly intervened.

"Please feel free to give a reasonable amount so it isn't burdensome."

Despite his words, a few people frowned.

Their eyes seemed to say, 'You should have said that earlier.'

Since Kim Tae-hyun and Kim Ah-young had already given ten million won, the place turned into a competition for face-saving.

As the check parade continued, Lee Hyun-woo had to repeatedly ask people to give a reasonable amount.

Finally, the extravaganza ended when Oh Min-woo appeared, looking half-asleep, and gave a thousand won.

After that, people could give without feeling pressured.

Kim Tae-hyun now said his goodbyes to Lee Hyun-woo.

"I have an appointment, so I'll head out."

"Yes, Hyungnim. Take care."

"Alright, see you later."

After saying this, Kim Tae-hyun turned his gaze to his sister.

But Kim Ah-young showed no intention of leaving.

"Ah-young, aren't you coming?"

"I'll stay a bit longer."

"What about you, Sun-hwa?"

"Me too."

"Alright? I'll call you later then."

Kim Tae-hyun's buttery smile made Choi Sun-hwa's face turn awkward.

'What's with that expression.'

Choi Sun-hwa didn't particularly like the attention from the notorious playboy Kim Tae-hyun.

So she roughly mumbled an answer and stood beside Lee Hyun-woo.

At the same time, she hardened her expression and asked with a touch of resentment.

"When did you two become so close? You're even on first-name terms."

"Oh, Hyungnim? We decided to be on first-name terms a little while ago. Since he's friends with Ah-young, it’s more comfortable that way."

"I'm friends with Ah-young too."

"......"

"There's no special qualification to be friends, right?"

"Absolutely not."

"Then..."

"Yes, let's be friends too. Actually, let's be friends."

Reluctantly, Lee Hyun-woo felt he had to wrap up this awkward conversation.

Honestly, he was now so tired of everything that he wanted to skip all the tedious processes.

'I hope things don't get more troublesome.'

Having recently made two female friends of the same age, he could foresee the upcoming processes.

Kim Yoon-sun was uncertain, but Kim Ah-young drank, went to nightclubs, and often came to the company these days.

Would Choi Sun-hwa be the same?

He wasn't sure, but she was an incredibly adaptive friend.

"Oh, right. I talked with Team Leader Han Se-jin, and he said they'll hold an event at the brand hall."

Since he was giving team leaders a lot of discretion these days, it seemed he collaborated with the development team to hold an event, giving such benefits to Choi Sun-hwa.

It wasn't bad.

After all, Choi Sun-hwa was the one who provided the first banner for the portal site.

In return, it was good, so he couldn't help but advise.

"If you target the Chinese and Southeast Asian markets with low-priced cosmetics, it'll be a big success."
