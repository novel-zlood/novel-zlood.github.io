Leaving Korea for just over a week, many things had changed during this time.

First, new types of mobile phones were catching people's attention.

One was 【Guseong Electronics】's MP3 phone, and the other was 【GB Electronics】's camera phone.

As industry rivals, they were competing fiercely in the new market.

Lee Hyun-woo watched with great interest.

The second thing concerned his own company, 【Jungle】.

Their web browser, 'Forest,' had boldly challenged 【Macro Soft】's 'Internet X Cross,' which had dominated the market until now, and was rapidly increasing its market share.

Of course, in Korea, it was causing a huge stir, but Lee Hyun-woo believed it had enough competitiveness.

‘Even I would use this.’

The most attractive feature was its uncomplicated simplicity.

Naturally, he expected successful performances in the United States, Japan, and the new markets of Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The third was the overall societal atmosphere, unrelated to information and communication.

It was the sign of an economic crisis.

Following 【Domifa Department Store】, news came out that several other places were also shaky, and perhaps in response to this, the government took unexpected measures.

'Government to Reform Comprehensive Financial Corporations'

Originally, comprehensive financial corporations were established to facilitate foreign currency inflow, and in fact, they attracted a lot of foreign currency due to Korea's economic growth and improved international image.

The problem was that they lent short-term foreign debt as long-term loans and became insolvent when they couldn't recover it properly.

Therefore, sensing the financial instability that had spread to Taiwan and Hong Kong, the authorities took action.

They intended to boldly eliminate those that couldn't restructure themselves.

As a result, those comprehensive financial corporations that were in slightly better condition began to show movement towards mergers, while those that were not were anxiously pondering how to put out the fire.

Lee Hyun-woo's inner thoughts were muttered unconsciously as he read and predicted.

‘More than half will disappear.’

Worry seeped in without him realizing it.

What would happen to the future of people working at companies that had disappeared all year and those that would disappear in the future?

Furthermore, as restructuring and mergers reduce branches and stores, naturally, unemployed people will pour out onto the streets.

Rumors of voluntary retirement were also starting to be heard.

If the unemployment rate rises like this, it will undoubtedly be a burden on the economy.

"Sigh..."

Knowing that he couldn’t save them all, Lee Hyun-woo could only let out a suffocating sigh.

Even though he knew that an economic crisis in South Korea couldn’t be completely avoided, he had hoped to prevent it without damage, which now seemed too greedy.

The one somewhat better point was,

‘At least the damage has been reduced. It’s different from my previous life.’

He had sprouted a new bud in IT.

Already, the 21st Century Venture Business Association had grown dozens of times larger than when it was first formed, and the growing information and communication companies within it were lowering the rising unemployment rate.

Moreover, as foreign investment flowed in through these companies, the exchange rate, which had once risen to 1,000 won, was currently stable.

‘It’s too early to relax.’

There were still mines left to explode in various places.

It was hard to pinpoint exactly where.

Difficult places would either survive or fail, and the people working there would lose their jobs.

The quickest way to check this was to visit 【Internet Headhunter】.

This site was created at Lee Hyun-woo’s request to 【Internet Goblin Market】, a partner company, and it was now growing into a promising dot-com company.

Places in need of people and people in need of jobs flocked there, especially those from the information and communication industry.

【Jungle】 also occasionally recruited personnel from there.

Though this time, he entered the site to check how many unemployed people had emerged,

‘As expected, many.’

He could feel that there were far more people looking for jobs than before.

Lee Hyun-woo clicked on a few entries.

His face grew darker as he did.

‘Their computer skills….’

The site, which primarily supplied the necessary manpower for the information and communication companies, naturally had a section for recording computer skills, but it was full of inexperienced people.

Even among his college classmates, there were some who were computer illiterate.

People who suddenly lost their jobs would mostly be in their 30s or older, so the proportion would naturally be high.

‘It seems like those in their 40s and 50s don’t know how to use computers at all.’

Considering this reality, reemployment could be a distant path for them.

Lee Hyun-woo’s eyes gained strength as he thought this far.

‘Don’t know much? Then we have to teach them!’

Another plan emerged.

It was to convert people trained in manufacturing to IT.

It would be challenging, but it was worth trying.

‘I need to utilize the funds that have flowed into the information and communication sector.’

Lee Hyun-woo immediately picked up his mobile phone.

The person he contacted was Jung Sung-woo, the president of the 21st Century Venture Business Association.

“If you have time, I’d like to meet briefly.”

* * *

Jung Sung-woo visited in the afternoon.

After listening to Lee Hyun-woo's story, he also recognized the situation correctly.

“We recently posted an open call for new employees, and the competition ratio was nearly 100 to 1. While it's partly because our company has grown and gained recognition, it also shows how hard it is to find a job.”

“That’s why I think the association should take the lead in retraining.”

This was precisely Lee Hyun-woo’s plan.

It was a time with less of a social safety net than the period he lived in.

If the government couldn’t do it, starting at the association level seemed like a good idea.

All these things required money.

Teachers, facilities, and equipment weren't going to come out of nowhere.

While requesting from the government was necessary, from Lee Hyun-woo's perspective, the government was also the one with the most pressing issues.

Even if there was a small amount of money, it would be hard to draw it out immediately, and there wouldn't be the leisure to pay attention.

Moreover, government actions were endlessly slow.

On the other hand, if Lee Hyun-woo got involved, everything could speed up.

“Our company has always carried out projects with 【Wangsimni University】. We could use some of the graduate students there as instructors.”

“Then I’ll look for a suitable location.”

“I hope I’m not making an unnecessary suggestion, given how busy you are.”

“No, I fully understand. Besides, do you think our company grew solely because of our own efforts? I’ve always believed it was because of the social foundation and people’s interest. So we should give back.”

Jung Sung-woo.

He was a good person.

Since becoming the president, he had been showing such attitudes more frequently.

“Many places are financially well off lately, so it won’t be difficult to secure funds for this project.”

“Then I’ll announce it through the portal site. I’ll also send out press releases.”

The coordination was smooth.

The timing would probably be after Chuseok.

‘Not bad. A project to find new jobs after retraining.’

Suddenly, the term 'creative destruction' came to Lee Hyun-woo's mind.

For a new industry to emerge and take root, the dismantling of existing industries was essential.

But it wasn’t something that happened artificially.

Society changes more slowly than one might think.

However, now was an unavoidable opportunity for change.

The information and communication industry was always short of people, so if they accepted middle-aged individuals armed with experience and diligence,

‘The picture will be different from my previous life.’

Suddenly, he glimpsed a faint dawn in the heavily sinking South Korean economy.

And when his lover, Kim Ah-young, came to visit after work, Lee Hyun-woo poured out his hopes over dinner.

* * *

“It was a bit depressing, as you predicted, but retraining doesn’t sound bad.”

“It can’t be a 100% solution, but I think it might help reduce the unemployment rate a little.”

Kim Ah-young couldn’t help but smile at Lee Hyun-woo’s hopeful voice.

She thought he was truly humane.

A world full of people only pursuing profit, and her boyfriend was someone who wanted to share what he gained.

“Is there anything I can do to help?”

“There’s a lot.”

“Like what?”

“To be most helpful, you could start a business. If 【Seorabeol Hotel】 grows, employment will naturally increase.”

“That’s true. But I was thinking of something I could do immediately.”

“There’s that too. This would work.”

This time, Lee Hyun-woo made a circle with his thumb and index finger.

It meant money was needed.

“If you donate to the 21st Century Venture Business Association, I’ll even bow to you.”

“Come on, no need for that. Just like you heard earlier, I also want to give back to society like President Jung Sung-woo. I’ve always thought our company grew not because we were great.”

“With such a sound thought, should I carry you on my back instead of bowing? I want to walk around the neighborhood and let everyone know that you’re my girlfriend.”

From Taiwan to Hong Kong, Lee Hyun-woo didn’t hesitate to express himself boldly.

His efforts were clearly visible.

Kim Ah-young, on the other hand, had a shy expression.

They were in a public restaurant, and there were quite a few people around.

They had come here because Lee Hyun-woo now disliked going to enclosed spaces, but she was worried about where their conversation might spread.

‘So what if it spreads? We’re not committing a crime.’

Kim Ah-young adjusted her expression again.

She then recalled her conversation with her youngest maternal uncle, Jang Jae-won, the previous day.

- Ah-young, I'm checking one last time to see if it’s okay to make this public.

- What is it?

- The thing between you and Hyun-woo. One of our reporters wrote it up almost confidently and is waiting for the editor's decision.

- Well, there’s nothing we can do about it.

Even if it wasn’t 【Sejong Daily】, it would come out in another media outlet.

With that in mind, they had started their public activities upon returning from Taiwan and Hong Kong.

It was time to inform Lee Hyun-woo as well.

“Oh, right. Hyun-woo, I talked to Uncle Jae-won yesterday, and it looks like our relationship will be in the newspaper.”

“Finally?”

“Yes, finally.”

“Much slower than I thought.”

It couldn’t be helped.

This was not the 21st century.

A time when you could instantly check real-time topics on a smartphone.

The world changes more slowly than one might think, and you always had to consider that time lag.

“I’m thinking of writing about it on my blog today.”

“What?”

Kim Ah-young’s eyes widened at Lee Hyun-woo’s bombshell declaration.

“If I write it on the Lee Hyun-woo Blog, it’ll be quickly and accurately communicated, right?”

“Hy... Hyun-woo…”

“Why? Shouldn’t I?”

“No? It’s not that, I mean, it’s not that…”

Lee Hyun-woo laughed as he looked at the flustered Kim Ah-young.

Then he spoke.

“Thinking you’ll give permission, I’ll post it on the blog tonight.”

Indeed, that night, Lee Hyun-woo posted a new blog entry.

- I have someone I love.
