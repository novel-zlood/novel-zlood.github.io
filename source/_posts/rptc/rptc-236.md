The following conversation between key personnel of 【Jungle】 to prevent Lee Hyun-woo's early retirement is quite dramatic.

"So, we'll hold on with Jamie Wang next week, then solidify our stance with the web browser war until the end of the year, and then meet Steven Job to enter the portal site war?"

"That's very likely. It seems like he's already started the portal site fight. He emphasized design to me, so it feels like he's preparing for a war with 【Pineapple】."

"That war is going to be really intense."

The voice of Oh Min-woo followed that of Jang Yoo-chul and Woo Sang-won.

"It seems the others are not going to take it lying down. Both 【Macro Soft】 and 【Pineapple】, and even 【Give and Take】, aren't staying still."

Everyone turned their gaze to Oh Min-woo's face at the mention of the three companies in succession.

His expression clearly indicated that something significant was unfolding.

As if admitting this, Oh Min-woo began to talk about his recent chat with Mikhail Face.

Woo Sang-won tilted his head and asked, "Mikhail? You mean Mikhail Face, the founder of 【Give and Take】?"

"Yes, that's right."

"Damn, what did that guy say? Because of him, our 【Jungle Music】's revenue is dropping."

Jang Yoo-chul, who was obsessed with MP3, got excited.

In fact, P2P sites were being created in Korea these days, and due to the 'Give and Take' which was their prototype, illegal uploads and downloads were increasing.

Oh Min-woo, calming his excitement, continued to speak.

"Hold on for a moment. I have something to say. That guy declared war on us."

"What kind of war declaration?"

"Don't be surprised. To overthrow 【Jungle】, three companies have united: 【Macro Soft】, 【Pineapple】, and 【Give and Take】."

"What?"

"……!"

"No way…"

Even Woo Sang-won seemed shocked.

He asked again to confirm.

"Are you serious?"

"Yes, it's true. It will soon be in the news. The three companies are challenging the 【Jungle】 and 【Yaho】 alliance with a jointly developed search engine."

"Alliance? We're just using 【Yaho】's search engine."

"Still, the announcement to the public was that we would jointly research a better search engine in the future."

Han Se-jin, who was always courteous, rarely spoke informally.

This time was no different.

Gleaming eyes while talking about joint research, he continued to share his opinion.

"But how about we join hands at this opportunity?"

"With whom? With Jamie Wang?"

"Yes, if those three companies unite, it would be serious, and honestly, we need allies too."

"You mean to form a strategic alliance. Not a bad idea."

"But what good is it if only we think that way? The CEO hyung-nim must think the same too."

"Strength in unity. We should advise all at once. Then even the stubborn hyung-nim will surely accept it."

* * *

Indeed, after spending the weekend, they went to Lee Hyun-woo together on Monday.

They suggested that if the three companies unite, an enormous synergy effect would surely occur, so they should join hands with 【Yaho】 for a joint response.

Lee Hyun-woo's eyebrows raised.

"Joint response?"

"Yes, we need to join hands with Jamie Wang. We are in a crisis now."

"Also, the atmosphere is not bad. Last time in Taiwan, they agreed on a cooperative competitive relationship, and in Hong Kong, it was Jamie Wang who immediately accepted our search engine. They will surely accept our proposal."

"It seems we can't fight alone. After all, we lack capital power."

"I also 100% agree with the directors' thoughts."

Finally, as Woo Sang-won declared, Lee Hyun-woo remained silent for a moment.

'Originally, I was planning to guide Jamie Wang on a tour to places like Gyeongbokgung Palace when she arrives.'

Of course, Jamie Wang had her 【Yaho Korea】 promotion duties, but she had already entrusted a day's schedule to Lee Hyun-woo, making it possible.

But to talk about work there?

"Just to clarify, I'm not suggesting meeting solely for business. According to the two secretaries I asked earlier, you were planning to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace that day, right? You can talk enough while seeing the palace and then respond together to the alliance of 【Macro Soft】. I came to you because I thought it wouldn't be bad. If it was too sudden, I truly apologize."

As expected, a position makes a person, Woo Sang-won not only organized well but also gave Lee Hyun-woo a reason and some leeway.

With no other choice, Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

"Alright. I'll talk with her."

The four people in the CEO's office smiled with satisfaction.

After work that day.

"It feels like something has reversed between me and my company's employees."

Lee Hyun-woo lamented with a smile to Kim Ah-young.

"Reversed? Why?"

"They keep bringing work to me. It's like they're driving the company into an explosive atmosphere."

"Something happened?"

When she asked, Lee Hyun-woo told her about the three companies teaming up to block 【Jungle】.

"Wow… really?"

"Yeah, that's how it turned out. But even if the three companies unite to jointly research a search engine, the end is already determined."

"The end is determined?"

"I mean the level of technology will eventually become similar, and then it will be a content battle."

As always, this time too, Lee Hyun-woo's voice showed a hint of ease and confidence.

If caught up in technology, they would win with content.

"Ah, of course, it's not that I don't want to talk business with Jamie Wang. Of course, it would be better if we join hands with 【Yaho】."

"And?"

"What people want is to win in the web browser war, portal site war, search engine war, etc. But as you know, these wars never end. Won't another war arise after that? Your 【Guseong】 and 【GB】 are the same. You've been in a back-and-forth battle for quite some time."

"True. But are you saying you don't want to fight? Maybe you're afraid of losing?"

It felt like Kim Ah-young was provoking him, but Lee Hyun-woo, after choosing his words carefully, shook his head.

"No. The probability of me losing is close to zero. But I don't know if you know me well, but once I start something, I have to see it through to the end. But as I said earlier, these wars never end. After winning the web browser war, and then the search engine and portal site, what next? Another war will be waiting for me…"

"……."

"When will I retire… I wonder."

"Didn't you set the standard last time? You said you would become number one in the information and communication industry, cultivate a successor, and hand over the company."

"Yeah, that's true, but…"

"Then draw the line right there. Just quickly achieve the goal. Isn't that right?"

It was a simple but clear answer.

And one that Lee Hyun-woo also knew.

"I guess so?"

"If you can't avoid it, enjoy it. It was something you told me sometimes."

"Right, I should enjoy it. Okay, then. Decision made. Become number one in the information and communication industry and retire early. Wait, I should set standards for this too. Should it be by market capitalization, revenue, or profit? What should it be?"

"Of course, it should be all three."

Kim Ah-young didn't hesitate.

There was a reason.

- Sister-in-law, Hyung keeps talking about early retirement, so please try to dissuade him a bit. A company can collapse as quickly as it grows. And with so many companies going under these days.

Lee Jung-woo had contacted her before she came here.

But even without his request, Kim Ah-young wanted to keep Lee Hyun-woo in active duty a bit longer.

She had her ambitions too.

'Market capitalization, revenue, profit.'

She knew well how hard it was to beat 【Macro Soft】, which was number one in the industry with these three.

Yet, Lee Hyun-woo smiled and nodded.

"Alright, then I'll become number one as quickly as possible and retire."

Lee Hyun-woo spoke as if he was retrieving something he'd left behind, showing his confidence.

It was truly fascinating.

When he said such things, it felt like he would really achieve it.

* * *

Two days later, a major article was published in the United States.

『Three IT companies jointly research a search engine!』

The mentioned companies were 【Macro Soft】, 【Pineapple】, and 【Give and Take】.

Moreover, the most surprised by this article was Joe Murphy of 【Jungle USA】.

'They're uniting? To confront us?'

Of course, it was to confront 【Jungle】, known for having the best search engine technology.

Consequently, in the stock market, the stock prices of 【Macro Soft】 and 【Pineapple】 were soaring.

Although the main products of the two companies were operating systems and computers respectively, the market perceived that they would dominate the portal site with a technically advanced search engine.

Additionally, Joe Murphy received a call from his former workplace, 【Natural Standard Fund】.

(Joe, the company is planning to add more investment to 【Give and Take】, is that okay?)

The question itself was very tricky.

Saying it was okay felt like admitting that 【Jungle】's search engine could be overtaken.

'If I say it's not okay, it would influence the investment.'

Joe Murphy gave a vague answer and hung up the phone.

Then he contacted Korea.

The recipient was, of course, Lee Hyun-woo.

Although 【Jungle】 and 【Jungle USA】 were not exactly a head office and a foreign branch, if the origin addressed this matter clearly,

'We have no reason to lose.'

Joe Murphy's belief in Lee Hyun-woo was solid.

As expected, Lee Hyun-woo wasn't surprised.

No, it seemed he already knew.

(The article has finally come out.)

"You knew?"

(Yes, I happened to hear about it.)

"What kind of response… would be good?"

(There's no need for a big response. Just give an interview. Or subtly leak something to the press.)

"What kind of…"

Even though he spoke as if it was nothing, it created anticipation.

Lee Hyun-woo's voice was heard again.

(If three companies need to unite, it means 【Jungle】's search engine is amazing. If we can imprint this image on people's minds, won't we gain more than what we lose? Hahaha.)

At that moment, Joe Murphy's pupils dilated.

And he found himself laughing along with Lee Hyun-woo's laughter.

"Hahaha, that's right. 【Jungle】's search engine is so great that three companies need to focus on it!"

One of them is the world's top information and communication company, 【Macro Soft】, another is the past symbol of innovation, 【Pineapple】, and the last one is a recently booming P2P service company, 【Give and Take】. If such companies join hands and shout to overthrow 【Jungle】, the corporate value will surely rise.

It was a moment when Joe Murphy was infected with Lee Hyun-woo's confidence.
