After the announcement of 【Pineapple】's move-in, a flood of activity ensued.

Numerous domestic and international companies declared a 'Jeju Rush.'

Because of this, Jeju Island had to scream with joy.

There were numerous projects that needed to speed up due to the significant difference from what the province had planned.

It could not be delayed just because it was hard.

'I promised Chairman Lee Hyun-woo. I'll give everything a 'free pass,' no matter what.'

Thinking that regulations shouldn't block the way, they meticulously reviewed relevant regulations and instructed to pass as many as possible to consider the circumstances of the incoming companies.

However, the area that Jeju Island found most challenging was still the living infrastructure.

Whether it was a research lab or a venture company, once a company moved in, employees and their families would relocate to Jeju Island, and they needed proper housing and essentials like appliances and furniture.

"Unlike the mainland, it takes over a week to receive items like TVs. It's the same for furniture."

"That won't do. We need to increase logistics."

"Yes, that's right. We also need more warehouses."

"Warehouses, huh..."

"Even if appliances and furniture don't have an expiration date, food does. With the population increasing beyond our predictions, we need to build many logistics warehouses."

"But we can't build them ourselves. That's the job of the businesses."

"Yes, that's right. So, we need to attract businesses. We should also offer tax benefits."

"Got it. Let's try that."

After listening to the opinions of the working-level staff, Goo Chang-mo stepped in directly.

He first invited construction companies.

He requested them to build many apartments in Jeju Island.

It wasn't difficult.

Since the government and Jeju Island were ready to grant unlimited permits, numerous construction companies started jumping in.

They also felt it.

That a significant number of people would settle in Jeju Island in the future.

『Jeju Island to offer 20,000 units next year!』

Although apartments that had been offered for sale two years ago were being built, the news spread like rain in a drought due to the still insufficient supply.

What heightened Goo Chang-mo's catharsis was the news that 【Jungle】 was building a warehouse.

And on an enormous scale at that.

"They're doing online shopping too, aren't they? It seems they've set a goal to build an infrastructure where you can click in Jeju and receive it within a few days."

Upon hearing the working-level staff's report, Lee Hyun-woo realized once again that he was a benefactor.

'Did I save the country in my past life? Or was I Lee Hyun-woo's wife?'

* * *

Now, that benefactor was smiling broadly, having just received a second cordless vacuum cleaner.

"It's much lighter than before. The suction power has also improved."

"Yes, I felt the same, but we still have a long way to go."

Han Il-jung responded modestly to Lee Hyun-woo's satisfaction.

In reality, he thought it needed more improvement. The gap in suction power compared to a corded vacuum cleaner was still significant.

'If this costs 2 million won, I wouldn't buy it.'

One redeeming feature might be that the design was sleek?

But would anyone be willing to spend 2 million on it?

"At this level, you could start selling it in Japan."

"Really? Are you serious?"

"Yes, although the performance is a bit lacking, the design scores high."

The initial model of the 【Tyson】 vacuum cleaner also had many issues.

However, it achieved tremendous success with its beautiful design, so Lee Hyun-woo cautiously predicted that this vacuum cleaner would perform its role.

"Instead, let's start developing the second model right after launching this one."

"Ah, yes... But I'm not sure if that's okay."

"I'm confident. It will sell really well."

With Lee Hyun-woo's assurance, Han Il-jung couldn't help but nod.

"Alright, then we'll begin production soon."

"How many can we produce in a month?"

"We're estimating a thousand units."

It's not a large number. But if they sell at the set price, a monthly revenue of 2 billion won would be easy to achieve.

'A minimum annual revenue of 24 billion won. Not bad.'

Moreover, since it's a high-priced product, the profit margin was over 50%.

"Let's aim for January next year."

"Understood."

Talking with Lee Hyun-woo had a peculiar hypnotic effect.

It made everything seem like it would work out.

It wasn't just Han Il-jung who felt this way.

A few days later, even Ray Burn and Michael Pace, who visited Korea, were caught.

* * *

"Nice to meet you."

"I've heard a lot about you."

As he shook hands with the two who entered the chairman's office, Lee Hyun-woo felt as if he had seen them before.

'I did benchmark 【Single】's corporate philosophy a lot.'

In reality, 【Jungle】 would conquer one area after appearing in search terms, and this order was roughly similar to 【Single】.

It wasn't exactly the same.

If anything, 【Jungle】 in this life was expanding its foothold in IT more diversely and at a formidable speed compared to 【Single】 in the past life.

This is because they pushed forward while compensating for the trial and error that IT companies in the previous life had gone through.

So, it didn't feel like meeting them for the first time, and a sense of gratitude even welled up in a corner of his heart.

Moreover, their mindset in this life seemed similar to that in the past life.

As they greeted each other and started talking, a courage that did not fear failure filled his heart.

"I'm not sure if you've heard from Min-woo, but we plan to start a food order and delivery service in Jeju simultaneously with our research lab."

"But the population in Jeju isn't much yet, is it?"

"Instead, it has enormous growth potential. Ah, you probably know better..."

"Yes, 【Jungle】 didn't relocate its headquarters to Jeju for no reason, did it?"

"Didn't move for no reason? Then why do you think I moved here?"

Lee Hyun-woo was curious about why others thought 【Jungle】 relocated to Jeju.

"The media emphasized the natural environment, but I think that's a secondary reason."

"That's right. Primarily, we looked at the trade environment surrounding Jeju. Around Jeju, there's Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Furthermore, Hong Kong is a gateway to China, and crossing the Taiwan Strait leads to Southeast Asia, and beyond Japan lies the vast Pacific Ocean..."

"Isn't it the perfect center for global trade?"

He was surprised by the different perspective.

It was interesting because these young and relatively inexperienced people didn't even consider trade barriers.

'No, someday trade barriers will be lowered. If that happens, Jeju could become the center of global trade, as they said.'

As they conversed, these individuals seemed to transcend borders.

This was similar to Lee Hyun-woo.

He thought that borders should be lowered in the future and should not restrict business.

So, he nodded with a smile.

"Listening to you, it's impressive. But that's not why I relocated the headquarters."

"Really?"

"Then..."

"Though the media has covered it a few times, it's primarily because I liked the natural environment here. That was the starting point, but once I started living here, I found many inconveniences. There are so many things that are lacking. And we can't create those things ourselves, and it's hard to procure them... As someone familiar with platforms, you know that it's tough to do anything without people gathering."

The two nodded. Lee Hyun-woo's remark that more people meant more diverse and better products was correct.

In such places, there are basic choices of products.

But in Jeju, the distributed products were almost fixed, making it impossible to think of choosing something better.

Because of this, many lived with whatever was available, whether it was there or not.

Lee Hyun-woo thought differently.

"So, I decided to gather more people. From then until now, I've been attracting companies with the governor of Jeju."

"Then, did you call Billy, Steven, and Jamie too?"

"Initially, I called them. Then, I explained the advantages of Jeju. Before that, it was about planning an ecosystem that could be an advantage. They must have seen no flaws in the blueprint created by us and Jeju."

"Wow..."

"That's truly impressive..."

"No, I think your thoughts are more impressive. Making Jeju the center of trade. Please make it happen. With more people, I think we can get anything here."

"Haha... We will try, but it will take some time."

"Still, I expect 【Jungle】 to shorten that time. I've already heard you're building a large logistics warehouse."

Watching them mention the logistics warehouse, Lee Hyun-woo smiled.

Their faces were filled with great envy.

In fact, they could also build a logistics warehouse with the investments they received, but running it immediately would be hard to manage the operating costs.

Lee Hyun-woo, who roughly guessed this, quickly proposed.

"That's right. The warehouse is just the beginning. However, it's the largest in the country, so there will be quite a few empty spaces until Jeju's population explodes. We could rent it to your company until then."

"What? Really?"

"Do you really mean that?"

"There's no reason we can't. If we receive a reasonable rent, we can also reduce our operating costs."

Their faces brightened. They repeatedly thanked him.

It was clear how grateful they were, as they kept repeating their thanks until they parted.

'Thankful? I'm the one who's more thankful.'

Lee Hyun-woo, who was deeply influenced by their fearless challenges in his past life.

It seemed like he was repaying that now.

No, it seemed insufficient, so he said,

"Oh, and since you're here, I'll give you a gift."

He handed them a cordless vacuum cleaner from 【Ilhan Electric】 that he received last time.

For reference, he had a total of five prototypes from 【Ilhan Electric】 in his possession.

His house was still large, and the battery charge was somewhat disappointing, so he requested one more, but the research lab gave him four more.

He gave one of those to the two.

"Although there are many cordless vacuums, none have suction power as strong as this. The battery life is a bit lacking, but it still lasts much longer than existing cordless vacuums."

"Ah... I see..."

The two tilted their heads at the sudden gift of a vacuum cleaner, but since it was a gift, they couldn't refuse it.

However, when they used it after returning to the U.S., they experienced a new world of cleaning.

"Wow, it makes using the existing vacuum cleaner inconvenient."

"Did you feel that too? Who knew it would be so convenient without a cord."

"The suction power is great, too."

"Yes, I want to use it at home. But I can't find anything similar on the market?"

"So, is it only sold in Korea?"

"Damn, I should have bought a few more."

"It's not too late. Let's find it."

"Yeah, it should be on 【Jungle Shopping】?"

Their expectations were far from reality.

So, not knowing how to get the vacuum cleaner, they sent an email to Lee Hyun-woo and received a reply.

- I made that vacuum cleaner because I found cleaning inconvenient. I asked a place called 【Ilhan Electric】 to make it. It's still a prototype, but since its performance is good, we're planning to sell it next year. If you like it, you can buy it then.

Unbelievable.

Making a vacuum cleaner because it was inconvenient. And it's set to be sold as a new product?

"Lee is truly an amazing person."

"Indeed. Making something because it's inconvenient? There's a lot to learn."

"We should visit Jeju often from now on."

"Yes, there's a lot to learn from Hyun-woo Lee, and the natural environment is also good for a break, so let's go once every quarter."

Thus, another person 'fell for' Lee Hyun-woo.
