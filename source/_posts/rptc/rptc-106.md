Two days later, Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo, who were set to leave for the United States, were taken to the airport.

"Is there a special reason why you come to the airport with each employee? Is it to impress us?"

"No, it's because neither of you has a car."

Lee Hyun-woo responded with a laugh to Oh Min-woo's unexpected question.

"That's a straightforward answer. Make sure to give us the motivation to buy cars when we come back."

"Hey, stop talking nonsense and let's go. Our hyung is a busy man."

"I'm not that busy, but as Jung-woo said, I don't want to hear any more nonsense. Hurry up and go."

He always had a leisurely demeanor.

Of course, he wasn't busy after work.

As Lee Hyun-woo was about to turn around after saying that, Oh Min-woo spoke firmly to him.

"I will make sure to establish the name of Jungle in America."

He kept saying unnecessary things until the end.

When Jung-woo was about to scold him again, Oh Min-woo giggled.

"Why are you laughing?"

"I just imagined the surprised look on your hyung's face."

"You idiot. Our hyung doesn't get surprised easily."

"This time, he might be a little surprised. We're going to apply the relationship algorithm I mentioned last time to the blog."

This algorithm was already completed, and he had instructed the team members to run final simulations before applying it.

Once applied, it would probably enable friend-making.

"But does our hyung even have a blog? He might not notice immediately."

"You worry too much. Others will tell him. But it's strange. Why doesn't your hyung have a blog?"

They still didn't know that Lee Hyun-woo was Nostradamus.

Therefore, Lee Hyun-woo didn't have the leisure to run a blog separately.

"It might be personal preference. He might find it bothersome. Think about it. He's become a complete celebrity. What will he do if he gets friend requests from everywhere?"

"You can get requests even without a blog."

"Oh, I see. That would definitely be bothersome."

"You seem too biased because he's your hyung, but this is the guy who came to Jungle on December 31st because he had no one to hang out with."

"Really? Our hyung?"

"Yeah, he begged me to hang out with him. If I hadn't been busy, I would have entertained him... But lately, he's been much better since he's been meeting that chaebol noona frequently."

When Oh Min-woo mentioned Kim Ah-young, Lee Jung-woo smiled faintly and thought of her face.

'She does match well with hyung.'

He hoped things would go well.

Now, he wanted to support their relationship.

Did she hear about it?

A text message from Kim Ah-young arrived.

- Jung-woo, have a good trip to America.

Why does 'Jung-woo' keep reading as 'young master'?

A mysterious smile spread across Lee Jung-woo's face.

* * *

Two days passed.

Though not as much as Oh Min-woo had expected, Lee Hyun-woo raised his eyebrows when he received a friend request message from someone.

'What is this?'

It appeared as soon as he logged into the portal Jungle, which he habitually accessed as soon as he arrived at work.

Then, messages kept coming in with the signal sound 'ding ding ding.'

- A friend request message from Rainy has arrived.

- A friend request message from Jujube has arrived.

- A friend request message from Tomato has arrived.

- A friend request message from Anne Gemil has arrived.

Lee Hyun-woo quickly clicked the notification window and moved to the message box.

He randomly clicked one, which was from Anne Gemil.

- Hyun-woo, it's me, An-young. I suddenly received a notification email that I could send friend requests. So, I sent one to you.

After clicking 'Yes' to the question of whether to accept the friend request, he carefully looked at various things.

'Did Oh Min-woo finally complete this?'

Just as he was curious, Yoo Jin-young entered.

"CEO, there's a call from Team Leader Oh in America."

"Put it through."

As he picked up the receiver, he immediately heard Oh Min-woo's voice.

(CEO, are you at work?)

"What is this?"

(What do you mean? It's the relationship algorithm I mentioned last time. I made it so that you can make friends on the blog. Oh, you can send requests even without a blog.)

"Oh, you rascal. You should have told me beforehand."

(I wanted to surprise you. Oh, since you might get too many friend requests, you can use the feature to hide your information from outsiders if it gets bothersome.)

"Alright, got it."

(And there's still a long way to go. Originally, I planned to release it after making it more perfect, but I remembered what you said. A good plan executed now is better than a perfect plan next week!)

It was a quote from George S. Patton.

He was a soldier who participated in World War II in America, and Hyun-woo had engraved that quote in his heart as it kept lingering in his mind.

After advising the otaku-like Oh Min-woo, he had sped up like this.

"Well done."

(I'll do well here too.)

"Hey, don't try to do too well. You'll burn out."

(That's not acceptable. You're the CEO who even got us business class tickets, not first class.)

"Sounds like you're hinting at getting first-class tickets next time?"

(I'll make more money for you and then ask confidently.)

He didn't deny it.

Still, he liked this guy's personality.

Even after hanging up, the pleasant feeling continued to spread.

'A blog where you can make friends.'

He suddenly imagined the expressions of the geniuses in America.

Namely, the founders and developers of Single, Face Note, Amazones, and Pineapple, who would gradually have fewer things to do.

'They're geniuses, so they'll figure something out.'

Thinking comfortably, he turned his gaze back to the computer monitor.

Now it was time to play around with the updated blog for a while.

* * *

By the time he was leaving work that day, he received a call from Woo Sang-won, who had just visited the second research institute after the first one.

(CEO, everything went well. We didn't demand excessive royalties.)

"Does that mean they might be considering researching MP3s?"

(Yes, probably. So, they'll come to Korea next time. It seems they'll finalize the contract after negotiating with you.)

"Got it. You've worked hard."

Lee Hyun-woo smiled broadly as he listened to Woo Sang-won's voice.

Of course, people's minds can change moment by moment, so there could be differences between verbal promises and actual written contracts.

But since they had announced it so confidently and were entering negotiations, he felt they wouldn't face legal issues for unauthorized use later.

(Did the two of them leave?)

"Yes, they did yesterday."

The two people Woo Sang-won mentioned were his younger brother Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo.

"They're probably discussing in-depth collaboration with Alta Vista by now."

(Then they'll feel the same way I did.)

"What did you feel, Team Leader Woo?"

(The world is watching Korea, and more specifically, Jungle.)

Is this person also becoming a 'Jungle addict'?

Lee Hyun-woo chuckled and said,

"I don't know about that, but I was surprised today with the new blog update."

(Oh? Really? I couldn't check because the internet here is too slow.)

"Enjoy it when you come back. It might be hard to access now."

(Okay, got it.)

"So, what time is it there?"

(It's almost ten o'clock. Phew, it's almost time to attend another forum.)

"Don't you like forums? The guys who went to America are attending a forum on a similar topic to Germany's at Stanford University."

(I almost died listening to the forum. Even with a translator next to me, it was hard to communicate.)

"I see."

(Though it was in English, thankfully, it was tough because we couldn't understand each other's German and Korean accents.)

"Ha ha, you worked hard."

It seemed like he was somewhat envious of Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo.

While Woo Sang-won could communicate in English to some extent, it wasn't easy to understand German-style English without actual conversation with Americans.

Having experienced that in his past life, Lee Hyun-woo could sense the hardship in Woo Sang-won's voice.

He encouraged and praised him again before ending the call.

* * *

Meanwhile, in America, Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo were entering a full-fledged business collaboration with Alta Vista.

To be precise, they were conducting a field inspection.

How much and how Jungle's search engine should be applied to Alta Vista's webpage.

"Why are they gathering like this since earlier?"

"I don't know. Maybe they're curious about us."

The developers of Alta Vista were surrounding and watching the two as they reviewed on the computer.

"By the way, this work won't be easy."

"Did you think we'd be able to do it all in America?"

"Absolutely not. We'll have to send developers after going back."

"This is getting more and more global for Korean developers."

Lee Jung-woo nodded at Oh Min-woo's words.

Starting with some developers who went to Japan last year, they were now set to dispatch to the U.S., realizing the term 'Jungle to the world' he had once told his hyung.

Is it true that seeing is believing?

Upon arriving there, it was clear that Jungle's level was much higher.

'Did I overestimate Silicon Valley and the U.S. all this time?'

Feeling proud, he said to Oh Min-woo,

"If we had started our business in the U.S., Yahoo would have been a breeze."

"Of course."

"But would Stanford be the same?"

"It wouldn't be much different. So, if it's below expectations, the disappointment would be big."

"Right. I hope there's at least one genius."

It might sound absurd to anyone listening, but the two were treating Yahoo, which had already surpassed trillions in market cap since its IPO last year, like a neighborhood shop and hoping Stanford's nerds would meet their expectations.

If Lee Hyun-woo were there, he would have given a sharp retort to their arrogance...

- The United States is not such an easy country.

Fortunately, the two soon met a proper rival when they arrived at Stanford.

It was Ray Berlin and Mikhail Face, who founded Single in their previous lives.

Clearly, they were researching the concept of the search engine that Lee Jung-woo and Oh Min-woo had designed and evolved.

"We have hypothesized focusing on the similarity and relationship of web pages."

"Yes, we plan to apply the algorithm after publishing a paper next month."

Listening to them disclose their research, Oh Min-woo surprised Lee Hyun-woo.

Speaking in fluent English,

"Sorry, but Jungle has already applied your hypothesis."

"……!"

"……!"

Their pupils shook with shock.

Looking at Oh Min-woo in disbelief, he continued,

"Jungle plans to enter the U.S. market this year. You can verify it then. Or you can visit Jungle's homepage in Korea now and try searching for any keyword. Alta Vista provided some web pages recently. I believe you can verify the algorithm of 'relationship' and 'similarity.'"

With such confident evidence, they started to panic.
