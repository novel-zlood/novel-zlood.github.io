A few days later, some people from 【Dae Han Electricity】 visited 【Jungle】.

The next day, Lee Hyun-woo visited 【Dae Han Electricity】 and began discussions about ADSL with the Vice President of the domestic division.

Lee Hyun-woo argued that since the testing phase was over, it was time to quickly distribute the service.

In fact, 【Dae Han Electricity】, which had laid power towers and transmission lines everywhere, was ready to jump in at any moment.

However, they were always wary of 【Dae Han Telecom】, but after confirming that Lee Hyun-woo's argument and public opinion were strongly in favor,

『【Dae Han Electricity】 completes ADSL testing and begins commercialization!』

Finally, they announced the commercialization through the media.

“Wow, even though I hurried them, it's only at this level.”

Lee Hyun-woo clicked his tongue and shook his head as he read the newspaper.

If he hadn't stepped in, they would have endlessly tested and then timidly attempted it bit by bit.

Fortunately, with the help of domestic and foreign media, it was advanced a bit, so he felt somewhat satisfied.

“Working with public enterprises is so slow, I can't stand it.”

This is the problem with bureaucracy.

Who knows how much time is consumed in the final stage, with endless considerations and worries about passing the blame later.

“For now, there are no alternatives, so this will have to do.”

At least it was fortunate that the situation developed differently from the previous life, where 【Dae Han Telecom】 pushed ISDN and blocked 【Dae Han Electricity】 from releasing ADSL.

At this point, Lee Hyun-woo thought about the future of 【Dae Han Telecom】.

“Will they continue with ISDN?”

Meanwhile, as Lee Hyun-woo expected.

With 【Dae Han Electricity】 announcing the commercialization of their internet business, 【Dae Han Telecom】 felt a strong sense of crisis.

The atmosphere within the group was grim.

Especially, the internet business division held meetings every day after 【Dae Han Electricity】's commercialization announcement.

Of course, Song Gil-ho, who moved from PC communication 【Hi】, saw the current crisis as an opportunity and increasingly asserted himself during the meetings.

Today, he outright presented the first agenda.

“If possible, we should also move to ADSL. Our own tests confirmed that ADSL is faster than ISDN, right?”

“That's true, but we've already made significant investments.”

“It's not time to rush to a conclusion yet. Testing in a confined space and in a broadband setting are very different.”

“I agree. And it's not easy to switch from ISDN to ADSL now. What about the areas where construction has already started?”

The problem was that there was significant opposition as well.

They argued that the speed difference between test areas and actual service areas was inevitable and that they could only acknowledge it once it was in use.

Moreover, they claimed that switching midway would result in enormous losses due to the investments made so far.

In fact, Song Gil-ho knew the real reason for their opposition.

“If losses occur, someone will have to take responsibility.”

The first person to be criticized would be the head of the internet division, Hwang Do-hoon, who was silently observing the meeting.

Who didn’t know that he was the one responsible for pushing ISDN?

“Then at least you should have prevented 【Dae Han Electricity】 from servicing ADSL.”

Even when public opinion was harsh and the media picked up the story, they should have intervened to prevent ADSL from coming out.

The real failure was not ISDN but the lack of such political power.

On the other hand, Song Gil-ho had been networking with influential people within the company.

One of them was Moon Jung-woo, who was eyeing Hwang Do-hoon's position.

So, he made eye contact with Moon Jung-woo and raised his voice again.

“We can recover the current losses by quickly transitioning to ADSL. However, if this is delayed, we will have to take even greater responsibility.”

The reason for emphasizing this again was to clarify the responsibility.

So that he could survive the upcoming personnel changes and align himself properly.

Of course, the alignment he was talking about was with Moon Jung-woo, a solid backing.

From Song Gil-ho’s perspective, Moon Jung-woo was a strong candidate for the next head of the internet business division.

Therefore, one word from Moon Jung-woo carried more weight than anything he could say.

“I think the same. Recently, an article verified the speed of ADSL. 【Jungle】 confirmed this, whether it's true or not. When 【Jungle】 pushes something, both domestic and foreign media pay attention, and their enthusiastic followers, the younger generation, support it. These are the people who consume the most internet. This is why ISDN cancellation inquiries have surged in the past few days, right?”

“……”

“Now is the moment to decide to avoid greater responsibility. At least some of you must think so.”

As expected, there was no rebuttal.

Internet division head Hwang Do-hoon's face lost its smile.

The situation had definitely changed.

In the past, unanimous opinions always came from here.

“It's time to step back.”

The moment of decision to either hold on or let go was right in front of him.

Hwang Do-hoon was a man of pride.

His stubbornness had kept him going until now, but he thought it was time to wrap things up responsibly and nodded.

“I will take responsibility, so please prepare for Dae Han Telecom's transition to ADSL.”

He put his hand in his pocket as he left the meeting room.

He felt a white envelope.

It was a handwritten document to maintain his pride while leaving the place he had grown attached to.

* * *

『【Dae Han Telecom】 also ventures into ADSL!』

Looking at the article that came out a few days later, Lee Hyun-woo's face brightened.

It was the same for the employees of 【Jungle】.

“They gave up faster than I thought? Switching ISDN subscribers to ADSL is going to cost quite a bit.”

“It's better than suffering greater losses later. The speed comparison is obvious.”

“Now there will be a speed competition.”

“Indeed. The speed that the entire nation experiences will get faster.”

“Then, the wind will blow more favorably for us.”

“Isn't the MP3 service we are preparing the biggest benefit? If the download speed is crazy fast, it will spread massively.”

Hearing this, Lee Hyun-woo spoke up.

“We're still far from done. It's just the beginning stage, so it will take at least 1 or 2 years for ADSL to be nationwide. Of course, we need to reduce that time.”

“How?”

Since the university vacation had started, all the team leaders could now attend the meeting.

As a result, everything was conveyed at once.

“Team Leader Han.”

“Yes, CEO.”

“【Samjin Computer】 is also our client, right?”

“Yes, we are still advertising with them.”

“Arrange a meeting with them.”

“…Yes, CEO….”

Han Se-jin responded a beat late, expressing curiosity.

“Is he planning something big again?”

As seen in the recent domestic and foreign press conference.

When Lee Hyun-woo steps in, things always get bigger and more complicated.

So, the instruction to arrange a meeting with 【Samjin Computer】 implied a significant move.

“What could it be? We were definitely discussing ADSL just now….”

No matter how much he thought about it, he couldn't figure out what Lee Hyun-woo planned to do through 【Samjin Computer】.

Knowing that the CEO always has a plan, he could only follow.

With this thought, he stepped outside and happened to run into Kim Yoon-soo, the CEO of 【Won Computer】.

“Oh, Team Leader Han. Where are you going?”

“Ah, yes, I'm going to 【Samjin Computer】.”

“【Samjin Computer】?”

Kim Yoon-soo showed a sense of alertness whenever he heard about a computer company.

Since 【One Computer】's growth was achieved with 【Jungle】's interest and affection, he was anxious that Lee Hyun-woo's focus might shift to another competitor.

“Why? Is there an event?”

“No, the CEO wants to meet the person in charge there. So, I'm going to arrange the schedule.”

“What? CEO Lee wants to meet their person in charge? Why?”

“I’m not sure about that either.”

Kim Yoon-soo’s pupils slightly trembled.

He seemed to think that Han Se-jin was pretending not to know.

“I really don't know….”

Han Se-jin thought to himself and smirked as he turned around.

He could guess why Kim Yoon-soo was worried.

He was probably concerned that 【Jungle】 might partner with 【Samjin Computer】 instead of 【One Computer】.

Seeing his anxiety, Han Se-jin couldn't help but laugh.

“I don't think he needs to worry so much.”

Lee Hyun-woo always wished for the growth of 【One Computer】.

He later learned the reason.

Kim Yoon-soo had entrusted him with the first online auction of 【Jungle】.

Also, when deciding on an office, he even paid the deposit, and he accepted whatever Lee Hyun-woo did without any doubt.

Because of this, 【Jungle】 achieved rapid growth in the early stages, as Lee Jung-woo and Jang Yoo-chul often said.

Having observed Lee Hyun-woo for a long time, Han Se-jin knew that he would never replace 【One Computer】 with 【Samjin Computer】 in the computer sector.

“Of course, since he always plans things that we can't imagine, it's best not to make hasty assumptions.”

He was convinced that if he couldn't understand Lee Hyun-woo, whom he personally considered a genius, he should focus more on removing obstacles to realize his intentions.

That’s why he hurried to 【Samjin Computer】 to meet the person in charge.

As soon as they sat down, the person in charge asked the usual question.

“Are you here already for next month's advertisement?”

“No.”

“Oh? Then….”

“Our CEO said he has something to discuss directly with 【Samjin Computer】. I came to convey this, so could you please expedite it?”

“What? The CEO of 【Jungle Soft】 himself?”

“Yes, that's correct.”

“Is there some special advertisement this time?”

“He didn’t mention that.”

“Then I need to find someone suitable for this ‘urgent’ matter.”

Han Se-jin didn’t respond.

What was certain was that it probably wasn’t about advertising.

Of course, banner ads weren’t simple.

Because the partner company always had clear preferences.

Although most issues were resolved at the working level, now that Lee Hyun-woo himself was stepping in, the counterpart was naturally surprised.

It seemed they had frequently heard about Lee Hyun-woo’s exploits from Han Se-jin.

Watching the busy person in charge go up to find someone, Han Se-jin smiled slightly.

“Well, I did talk a lot about 【One Computer】.”

Considering the position of 【Samjin Computer】 in the same industry, the shock they felt was incomparable to Kim Yoon-soo’s.

They had acknowledged it several times.

“It's driving us crazy being squeezed between premium brands like 【Guseong Electronics】 and low-cost brands like 【Won Computer】.”

Even though it was a computer boom, not all computers sold well.

In the market, premium and budget models sold the best.

As a result, 【Samjin Computer】, in an awkward position, was suffering in both sales and operating profits.

Looking deeper, wasn’t this also influenced by Lee Hyun-woo?

Perhaps because of this, the response from the person in charge who came down was even more shocking.

“The chairman wants to meet in person.”

The chairman of the mid-sized company 【Samjin Computer】 wants to meet Lee Hyun-woo personally?

Finally, it was confirmed where Lee Hyun-woo stood.
