Kim Ah-young's face clearly showed signs of confusion.

"Ah... What should I say? Actually, it seems 【First Wool】 has entrusted your father's company with dyeing."

She spoke as if she had no involvement, but Lee Hyun-woo was certain.

That Kim Ah-young played the intermediary role.

‘I can understand why.’

The plan of his girlfriend and younger brother was, in a nutshell, to help his father elevate the company to at least a mid-sized clothing company!

The reason being that the family of Lee Hyun-woo needed to be of a certain ‘status’ for progress in their relationship.

He felt half bitter and half pleased.

‘Once again, I realize our family is struggling.’

On the other hand, it wasn't a bad feeling knowing she was taking their relationship more seriously.

So, he changed the topic, parted ways with her, and thought about it on his way home.

‘Yes, we can’t keep our relationship ambiguous forever.’

Though not immediately, it was time to start revealing it to his parents.

As soon as he got home, he took Lee Jung-woo to his room.

But his younger brother had a peculiar expression.

"You talked to Ah-young, didn't you?"

"Uh..."

"You two are really up to all sorts of schemes now."

"You also secretly ran Nostradamus' blog. I deserve to keep some secrets and progress with my own work."

"Very logical. Absolutely logical."

When Lee Jung-woo gave a nonsensical reason, Lee Hyun-woo replied sarcastically.

Lee Jung-woo then quickly spoke with an awkward expression.

"It might seem like it's for your sake, but it's actually for our parents. Later on, when they find out you're dating the eldest daughter of 【Guseong】, they might develop an inferiority complex."

"......"

"Of course, as time goes on, your competence will shine through and balance things out with that family, but I wanted to speed up that process a bit."

Lee Hyun-woo had nothing to say.

Once again, he thought.

‘Did Ah-young feel the same way?’

Could she have plotted with his brother to hurry their relationship along?

"Who suggested it first?"

"Hyung... It was your girlfriend..."

"Really?"

"She likes you so much that she gave your father’s company some work. Think of it that way, and don’t blame her later."

"I won't. Why would I? I actually feel good about it."

"Really? Your pride isn't hurt?"

"You just said it yourself. As time goes on, my competence will shine through and balance things out."

That meant Kim Ah-young did this to not lose Lee Hyun-woo, knowing his competence would eventually shine through, and Lee Hyun-woo understood her feelings and felt good about it.

Lee Jung-woo was so taken aback by his brother’s confidence that he stammered.

"Th... That's right, ac... actually."

"Anyway, now that the arrow has been shot, I'll actively help father."

"I'm looking forward to it. But will it be okay?"

"What do you mean?"

"You said the Korean economy was going to be unstable?"

Lee Jung-woo was still amazed when he recently found out his brother was Nostradamus.

He also meticulously examined the blog.

The conclusion written there was the bleakness of the Korean economy.

Naturally, he couldn't help but worry about their father's business.

"Nostradamus did say that. Giant companies would go bankrupt, and foreign exchange would become unstable."

"That's what was said back then."

"And now?"

"The situation has changed a bit. Of course, it doesn't mean no companies will go bankrupt, but new forces are emerging, so it's hard to say."

What Lee Hyun-woo said was true.

At some point, foreign investments continued in the information and communication sector.

Originally, in his past life, the exchange rate was more unstable than it is now, but the influx of foreign exchange was leading to gradual stability.

"So, before the exchange rate rises further, I need to send father to the U.S."

"Huh? What do you mean?"

"A fashion brand that's well-suited for the Korean market has just emerged in the U.S. If we import and sell their products, it will do really well. But we need to secure a good contract. For that, I might have to go myself or ask Joe Murphy."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"It's something like that. Anyway, I'll handle the rest, so stop worrying and... focus on developing the game you were working on."

"It's progressing quickly. The test version is already complete."

"Really?"

"Yeah, but it's just a test version as you mentioned before. We're testing it by having three races fight each other to balance things out."

"Ah..."

He roughly understood.

‘Like the game league I saw in my past life, they’re adjusting the balance by having two people choose races and fight.’

He suddenly thought of Hong Yo-han, the synthesizer tutor.

He was a famous gamer in his past life, so it was natural he came to mind.

‘Well, in this life, he'll debut as a singer, so he won't be stepping into the world of gaming.’

Of course, that is if he succeeds as a singer.

If things don't go as planned, he might shift to the gaming industry...

* * *

After finishing the conversation with his brother, Lee Hyun-woo called Joe Murphy, matching the U.S. time.

(Hello?)

"It's Hyun-woo Lee."

After exchanging pleasantries, he stated his purpose.

"Can you connect me with 【GAPE】?"

(Of course. But are you planning to sell 【GAPE】 clothing online?)

"No. Actually, my father has entered the fashion business. So, we want to exclusively import and sell 【GAPE】."

(Ah, I see what you mean.)

Joe Murphy, with his experience, quickly understood Lee Hyun-woo's intention.

(Then first, I'll check if 【GAPE】 is interested in entering the Korean market and get back to you.)

"Yes, thank you."

After hanging up, Lee Hyun-woo mentally organized the sudden plan he had devised today.

Originally, American companies adopt two approaches when entering other countries.

One is to operate directly, and the other is to merge with local capital and sell through a joint venture.

Honestly, 【GAPE】 would naturally prefer the latter.

Due to the uncertainty of success in a new market.

‘If it's 【GAPE】, it should do well.’

This was based on his past life's experience.

In his past life, 【GAPE】 partnered with 【New World International】 to create a joint venture and sold clothes at high prices.

Even though 【GAPE】 is a fast fashion brand, it sold well because it suited Koreans.

So, he thought forming a joint venture with a 50-50 share, importing, and selling would be a good idea.

‘Yes, this time, I’ll use my son’s chance to the fullest. The filial duty I couldn't fulfill in my past life, I'll accomplish in this one.’

* * *

The next morning, Joe Murphy contacted him.

(They seem quite positive about entering the Korean market. And when I subtly mentioned 【Jungle】, they seemed even more interested and wanted to meet to discuss specifics.)

"Is that so?"

(It looks like you'll have to come to America again. Hahaha.)

"Seems so. But I can't avoid it. I also want to feel firsthand how well 【Jungle USA】 is doing."

The success of 【Jungle USA】 was almost a given.

With the addition of 【Jungle】 followers to the existing users of 【AltaVista】, it was creating a new wave with content that had never been seen in America.

Talks of an IPO were already circulating.

(When you come, you'll surely feel that the dominance of 【Jungle】 in the U.S. is imminent. Hahaha.)

With Joe Murphy's laughter ending the call, Lee Hyun-woo immediately visited his father’s company.

His father, discussing something with designer Lee Hwan, looked surprised to see him and asked.

"What brings you here?"

"It's only natural for a son to visit his father's company. Nice to see you, Mr. Lee Hwan."

"Oh, long time no see."

"This is perfect timing. Mr. Lee Hwan should also know about this, so I can tell you both at once."

"Really? Do you have something to say?"

"Yes. Father, and Mr. Lee Hwan, do you know about 【GAPE】?"

"I think I've heard of it..."

"Yes, I know it. It's an American fashion brand."

As expected, being a designer, Lee Hwan knew about 【GAPE】.

So, Lee Hyun-woo began explaining 【GAPE】 to his father with a smile.

"They are famous for being an affordable company. And that type of clothing brand is called a fast fashion brand in English."

"How cheap are we talking?"

"Though not as much as last year, our current exchange rate is quite favorable. So, a T-shirt would cost less than 5,000 won. But with import duties and logistics costs, it would sell for more than 10,000 won here."

"What? Import? Are you saying you want to import clothes from 【GAPE】?"

"Yes, that’s why I’m here."

Finally, Lee Hyun-woo revealed the purpose of his visit.

"Father, personally, I think a brand like that can enter department stores. Moreover, we can set up stores in places like Myeong-dong or Gangnam."

"Didn't you just say it was a cheap brand?"

"Yes, but here, it can be sold at a high price. Of course, if we sell it too expensively, it would be unethical, so if we price it moderately, the profit should be sufficient."

This had already been proven by 【New World International】 in his past life.

Believing in that, Lee Hyun-woo continued speaking.

"However, the design needs to suit Korean people better, and for that part, we have to rely on Mr. Lee Hwan here."

"Me...?"

"Yes, if we sit at the negotiation table with 【GAPE】, we will tell them that we need to incorporate our own designs into their fashion designs. Naturally, the person to handle our designs would be Mr. Lee Hwan, right?"

"Oh... yes... then... it would be an honor for me."

Lee Hwan stammered.

It was only natural because 【GAPE】 was quite a famous company.

Even though Lee Hyun-woo mentioned it was a cheap brand, it was only targeting that segment.

‘Come to think of it, he did ask me before. Whether I would make expensive clothes for a select few or popular clothes for many.’

At that time, Lee Hwan had answered.

Maybe because he was hungry, he chose the latter.

Could it be that from back then, Lee Hyun-woo had been envisioning a grand plan like this?

Naturally, it wasn't.

Lee Hyun-woo’s identity had always been the same.

He was just flexible, adept at improvisation, and now was targeting the import and sale of 【GAPE】 according to the situation.

Still, he wanted to ask his father's opinion.

"I’ve roughly finished my explanation. What do you think, father?"

Without hesitation, his father nodded.

"Although it's a bit troubling to rely on my son again, it seems like a good opportunity. I want to give it a try."

A broad smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo’s face.
