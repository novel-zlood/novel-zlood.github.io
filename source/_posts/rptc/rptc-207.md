The most effective marketing method was making people want to buy products after seeing a famous person or someone close to them using it. In reality, the people who attracted the most journalists were celebrities, so it was more effective for people like Clones or Kim Yoon-sun to use MP3 phones rather than ordinary people.

Perhaps that's why?

When they arrived a little later, Kim Ah-young once again started distributing MP3 phones to celebrities.

Lee Hyun-woo laughed as he watched.

"Looks like Tae-hyun oppa made a huge request."

This was essentially a form of sponsorship.

However, there was an even more effective method that Lee Hyun-woo had already used.

That method was utilizing blogs.

But since blogs didn’t exist yet in Hong Kong or Taiwan, shouldn’t celebrities use the MP3 phones in front of journalists?

"Hey, this MP3 phone and MP3 player overlap a bit."

"Yeah, even Alpha Cast requested it."

As they boarded the plane, Clones' conversation could be heard.

"Everyone is trying their best to promote their products."

So Lee Hyun-woo helped them out.

"Then one of you can use the MP3 phone, and the other can use the MP3 player."

"That sounds good, right?"

"Okay, then I'll use the MP3 phone when I get off later."

"Alright, I'll use the MP3 player."

At that moment, Kim Ah-young leaned in slightly and whispered to Lee Hyun-woo.

"I couldn't help it because oppa asked so much."

"Well, it's not bad. The more MP3 phones and MP3 players are distributed, the better our music service will become."

When one product sells, another closely related product sells well too.

There had been cases like this before where two products formed a set.

GB also first launched synthetic detergents in the market, and when they didn't sell well, they released affordable washing machines.

The result was a huge success.

Since then, washing machines and synthetic detergents have become a set in our country.

"But while we did it for your benefit, we also obtained some information leaked from our industry rivals."

"Huh? What is it?"

"They're about to launch a camera phone. From GB Electronics."

"Oh..."

Lee Hyun-woo immediately exclaimed.

Guseong and GB are recognized as rivals in the business world.

Recently, Guseong Electronics has been continuously launching innovative products, so it seems GB Electronics has also put great effort into developing something.

"A camera phone is good too. It will make our blog even more active."

"Huh? Really?"

"Of course. Since not many people have digital cameras, blog posts have mainly been text-based. But with a camera phone, there might be more photos, right?"

It was certainly going to be more than that.

Although they might not be able to post directly from their smartphones, uploading stored photos to the internet would become very frequent.

Choi Sun-hwa, who overheard the conversation between the two, chimed in.

"Wow, Jungle benefits no matter what they do. It feels like they've occupied all the crucial points."

Lee Hyun-woo just laughed because it was true.

* * *

On the flight to Taiwan, people felt as if the plane had been entirely chartered.

That's because it was filled with employees and affiliates from Jungle, Guseong, and Aejeong, along with their secretaries and security personnel, as well as celebrities and their agency staff.

So, the three women who had become friends, Kim Ah-young, Choi Sun-hwa, and Kim Yoon-sun, chatted without being conscious of others' gazes.

"Are you using Yoon-sun for your cosmetics advertisement?"

"Yeah, Yoon-sun is a pillar of Hallyu. There's no reason not to use her."

"I'm not quite a pillar. I just got lucky."

Although she was being modest, Kim Yoon-sun was enjoying her second prime these days.

In Korea, she had perfectly transformed from a video singer to an audio singer, and in the Chinese-speaking world, she was receiving immense popularity, just as Choi Sun-hwa said.

"So, should we also consider Yoon-sun's concerns?"

"Your hotel?"

"Yeah, a lot of Chinese people are visiting Korea these days. The number of people coming from Taiwan and Hong Kong has also increased."

"Oh... then you should use her."

"Does that mean I suddenly become an advertiser?"

"Oh, advertisers are not the top dogs these days. The most popular celebrities are the real top."

"That's right, that's right."

"But I'm a bit worried that my follow-up song might fail."

At this point, Kim Yoon-sun glanced at Lee Hyun-woo, who was sitting far away.

In fact, the previous song was practically made by him.

Moreover, Absolute Pitch from the same agency gained popularity in the U.S. after remaking Macaroni based on Lee Hyun-woo's advice.

"He really seems like someone who can do anything."

Although she knew it was greedy, her anxiety was screaming at her, wondering if there was any melody floating around in Lee Hyun-woo's head.

But Kim Yoon-sun wasn't the only one thinking this.

Absolute Pitch, who was also on the plane and aware of the situation, was quietly asking their member, Hong Yo-han, in a low voice.

"Yo-han hyung, why aren't you going to tutoring these days?"

"Really? You're close with Jungle's CEO. And he's the one who has given us infinite grace, so you should see him often."

"I think you should do that too. One should never forget grace."

"It's not that I didn't want to go. I've just been extremely busy these days."

"The busier you are, the more you should go."

"Exactly. Haven't you heard of the saying about the tiger repaying grace? Go sing for him and teach him how to play instruments."

"That's right. If he calls, you go; if he tells you to leave, you leave. You should be someone comfortable and easy for the CEO."

"Geez, I get it. You mean I should go and pick up any crumbs that fall, right?"

"Aw, that's not it, hyung."

"Wow, you're making us out to be shameless guys."

"Right? The CEO enjoys singing and gaming with you. Honestly, it must be lonely up there. So you should go and keep him company whenever you can."

Hyun Chang-su, CEO of Hyun Entertainment, who was listening directly to their conversation, was also thinking.

To be honest, both Kim Yoon-sun and Absolute Pitch had received great benefits from Lee Hyun-woo.

With just one top singer, an entertainment planning agency can thrive, and they already had two.

Now, they had the momentum to nurture new singers anytime.

"Don't worry, kids. I'll visit Jungle often to alleviate his loneliness."

To repay the grace and possibly pick up any crumbs they wanted, frequent visits were essential.

Of course, in this world, you have to give something to get something.

So Hyun Chang-su quickly interjected into Absolute Pitch's conversation.

"You're managing your blog well, right?"

"Of course. I always write good things about Jungle."

"I always upload products I bought from Jungle Shopping with my digital camera."

"I regularly visit Jungle's fan cafe and leave comments saying that without Jungle, it would have been hard for us and our fans to meet online."

"I don't know if it helps directly, but I wrote about how fun the game we played at Jungle was."

The last comment came from Hong Yo-han.

Even though he got beaten multiple times by Lee Hyun-woo, the game they tested at Jungle was thrilling and fun.

When he expressed that in writing, fans were now leaving numerous comments saying they couldn't wait to see the game.

"Good, you're doing well. Keep it up."

Hyun Chang-su smiled contentedly at these efforts to repay the grace.

"If we keep this up, the CEO will recognize our sincerity and might even create another song for us."

Suddenly, the voice of Oh Jung-hwan, the producer who arranged Kim Yoon-sun and Absolute Pitch's songs, came to mind.

- It really seems like God concentrated abilities on one person. If the CEO hadn't gone into business, wouldn't he have produced incredible songs in our music industry?

* * *

Meanwhile, Lee Hyun-woo, unaware of the evaluations about himself, was conversing with Clones.

Since they were celebrities, the topic was inevitably about that field.

"Really? Are you really close to Wang Ji-hyun?"

"Yeah, but your reaction is no joke."

"Is Wang Ji-hyun your ideal type?"

"Hey, is there any guy who doesn't like Wang Ji-hyun?"

Lee Hyun-woo couldn't hide his excitement while looking at the two.

Of course, this was akin to the admiration a fan feels for a celebrity.

"Right, no man wouldn't fall for Wang Ji-hyun after watching 'A Chinese Ghost Story.'"

"Exactly. But seeing your reaction, Hyun-woo, we should arrange a meeting."

"Oh, that's not necessary. I'm satisfied just seeing her from a distance."

"Oh? That's perfect. She's appearing as a guest when we broadcast in Taiwan."

"Wow, you guys are more popular in Taiwan than I thought."

"Didn't you know? We're pretty popular in Taiwan."

"No, no. Honestly, more journalists might come to see you at the airport."

"That's nonsense, hahaha."

Even though Lee Hyun-woo had an innovative image in the information and communication field, how could he compare to the pioneers of Hallyu?

In reality, after returning to Korea, there was a tremendous roar directed at the Korean stars, and the camera flashes of the journalists were focused on them.

However, economic journalists also swarmed Lee Hyun-woo, bombarding him with cameras and questions.

"Our team leader Han and team leader Kang have done a great job of warming things up."

He had already heard that the news about Lee Hyun-woo visiting Taiwan had been distributed as a press release.

Entering in a grand manner would ensure Jungle's smooth sailing in Taiwan.

Of course, there was Yahho, which would start first, but Lee Hyun-woo and his employees were confident.

"One thing for sure, I believe in the power of Hallyu."

Thinking that Hallyu was one of the various weapons of domestic companies and planning to utilize it to the fullest, Lee Hyun-woo headed to the accommodation.

* * *

As soon as they arrived at the accommodation, Kang Dong-ho and Han Se-jin briefly stopped by to inform Lee Hyun-woo of the schedule.

Then they subtly mentioned what had happened at the airport earlier.

"Indeed, celebrities are amazing. They naturally took out and used the MP3 phone and MP3 player, striking the best poses for photos."

"Yes, it seemed like Taiwanese journalists and fans were quite interested. Both products are likely to be hits."

Nodding, Lee Hyun-woo responded.

"As you saw today, Hallyu is gradually heating up. Therefore, we need to find ways to maximize the use of Hallyu fever in our marketing."

Even if you have three thousand beads, you need to string them together to make a treasure.

If they didn't properly utilize the weapon called Hallyu, Jungle, which had started a bit later, might struggle initially.

In that sense,

"Focusing more on 'Make friends' rather than the blog might not be a bad idea."

Lee Hyun-woo planned a concentrated bombardment of Jungle's content.
