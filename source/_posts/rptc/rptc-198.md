Lee Hyun-woo sincerely congratulated the success of the Macaroni remake.

"Is it just the beginning now?"

From now on, it must be done well.

Even if Lee Hyun-woo can touch it, it cannot succeed without his own efforts.

At home, he sees someone facing a similar situation.

It was his father.

"Are you meeting Jasper tomorrow?"

"Yes, finally, the day has come."

"You must be nervous."

"It would be a lie to say I'm as usual. But recently, talking with your mother, I steeled my mind. And even while working, I suddenly felt it. I've lived diligently all this time, and I can't miss this opportunity given by God and helped by our son."

"That's right, Father. Diligence is the most certain shortcut to success. Our family, at least, is a witness to how diligent you have been. It will probably go well."

What Lee Hyun-woo said was true.

Rain or snow, his father Lee Jung-yong worked very diligently.

Most people know that diligence is the key to success, but how many actually do it?

"Hahaha, yes, that's right. My only asset is diligence."

"Yes, I learned that from you too, Father. I don't know about other things, but I always finish what I take on with responsibility."

Maybe this is why he became a workaholic.

"Come to think of it, being a workaholic isn't necessarily a bad thing, is it?"

Lee Hyun-woo chuckled to himself.

At this rate, he might end up justifying his workaholism.

He recalled the words of Oh Min-woo, which he had been mulling over recently.

"Hyung, you are paradoxical. There is always a gap between your words and actions. Honestly, after work, you don't exercise like we do, do you?"

Of course, it depends on what you consider as work.

For example, he didn't think of taking Joe Murphy and Jasper Murphy to the hotel today as work,

"No, this is work too. Reflect. There is a gap between my words and actions, just as Min-woo said."

In that sense, he decided to go out early in the morning for exercise tomorrow.

* * *

Indeed, Lee Hyun-woo went out at dawn and entered the fitness room,

"One, two, three, four..."

"Five, six, seven, eight..."

"..."

Why are there so many employees?

Some started greeting him upon discovering him.

"Oh? President?"

"You're here?"

"Hello!"

"Finally seeing the president in the fitness room."

"Are you coming out to exercise early in the morning?"

"Yes, I have to work overtime today."

"Me too."

"I have work on the weekend."

"I decided to make today my exercise day to catch up for the week."

Lee Hyun-woo looked at the young employee who spoke last with a puzzled expression.

"Is it effective to cram exercise like this?"

He remembered the young man's name and asked,

"An Soon-hyung, isn't it better to exercise consistently every day?"

"Haha, yes... I'll do that. But I've been really busy lately."

"You're busy? Wait a minute, come to think of it, you were temporarily assigned to Director Oh Min-woo's team, right?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Lee Hyun-woo recalled a recent event.

Professor Geum Sang-jun, director of the Science and Technology Department, requested defense for a national institution, and he entrusted the task to Oh Min-woo.

At the same time, he gave the authority to summon anyone,

"Just one person will do."

"Who is it?"

"An Soon-hyung."

So, this young man, An Soon-hyung, was particularly engraved in his memory.

He was an unusual figure who joined Jungle right after graduating from high school.

"It seems helping Director Oh is quite demanding."

"Not really. It's actually fun."

"Fun?"

"Yes, it's thrilling in its own way to block hacker attacks with Director Oh."

Lee Hyun-woo chuckled.

Maybe because he's still young, he finds joy in the work.

"Don't become too much of a workaholic."

He advised internally as he started with the treadmill.

Diligence is not only his father's asset but also Lee Hyun-woo's.

Now that he started exercising in earnest, he might do it every day.

* * *

Meanwhile, Lee Hyun-woo's father, Lee Jung-yong, met with a representative from GAPE and faced them with a confident expression, shaking off his nervousness.

"Nice to see you again."

"Yes, have you been well?"

Even though they had an interpreter, Lee Jung-yong thought non-verbal communication was important in business.

People seeking his dyeing factory were not only domestic but also foreigners, and he had learned from dealing with them.

Once again, Jasper Murphy from GAPE had come.

The first place he took him was New World Department Store.

It was to show the store location and give assurance to the counterpart.

"This is the main store?"

"Yes, it is. It's practically the first store."

"The location is good."

"The department store has been very considerate."

It was true.

The department store had designated royal spots on each floor, and the planned store location was one of them.

They were also lucky.

The company occupying this spot had gone bankrupt.

But would their luck continue today?

"Excuse me, are you the president of Tuwu Fashion?"

While interpreting and talking with Jasper Murphy, someone approached.

Looking back, it was a woman slightly past middle age,

"Oh, I operate this place."

When she introduced herself, he couldn't help but open his eyes wide.

"Could you be the chairman of New World Group?"

"Yes, I am. I'm Kim Sung-hee."

"Ah, I'm Lee Jung-yong."

"And the person next to you..."

"This is Jasper Murphy from GAPE headquarters in the U.S. Interpreter, could you introduce Chairman Kim Sung-hee to Mr. Murphy?"

Lee Jung-yong introduced them to each other with full alertness.

Even though it was a coincidental meeting, it was practically an endorsement of Tuwu Fashion by both parties.

In fact, when Kim Sung-hee spoke to Jasper Murphy,

"We have high expectations. Since GAPE is such a good brand, we thought it would succeed in Korea."

A response came immediately.

"We are also 99% confident in the success of the Korean market. We are working closely with Tuwu Fashion's designers for localization."

This was true.

Although not hired by Tuwu Fashion, they had many conversations through phone or email exchanges with Hwan.

When Jasper Murphy said this, Kim Sung-hee smiled and replied,

"We will do our best to support you at New World Department Store."

"Thank you very much."

It was a short conversation, but Jasper Murphy thought to himself.

Tuwu Fashion was already fully prepared.

Also, since the shoe negotiations in the U.S. were almost done and the contract had been revised,

"Now, we just need to sign."

There was no need to drag out the time.

On the other hand, Kim Sung-hee turned around with a subtle smile.

"A virtuous woman has emerged."

The reason she had come here was simple.

She had just received a call from Kim Ah-young.

"Aunt, Mr. Hyun-woo's father is going there today. Since someone from GAPE is coming, please just show your face."

The reason for this was all because of Lee Hyun-woo.

Indeed, Lee Hyun-woo's stock was rising day by day.

There were already many families secretly coveting him as the potential son-in-law of Guseong.

"That can't happen. He is destined to be my nephew-in-law."

* * *

In the morning, he welcomed Joe Murphy.

Having barely discussed business in the car yesterday, Joe Murphy now fully briefed Lee Hyun-woo on the ongoing projects in the U.S.

Most of the news was positive.

"Although much slower than in Korea, the ADSL range is expanding every day. Therefore, the success of Jungle Music, which is being prepared, seems assured."

The reason for his confidence was the lack of market competitors.

The best competition is having no competitors at all.

"Of course, there are some concerns. P2P sites are expanding faster than expected."

"Rather, P2P might become the competitor?"

"Exactly. I once heard from a businessman that instead of creating a new market from the start, steal part of the existing market. Now it seems P2P is really trying to steal part of the existing market."

"Fortunately, we are also preparing."

"Yes, I heard last time. You are putting a lock on MP3 files."

"In the future, we aim to change the file extension entirely so that the music files can only be played in Jungle's software. This is more complicated than expected, so it will take some time."

That's why he hadn't mentioned it to Joe Murphy before, but now he hinted at it since they seemed to be in sync with the three major record companies.

At the same time,

"Existing MP3 players can install the software through an update, so don't worry too much."

He alleviated any potential concerns.

In a short time, Alpha Cast's MP3 players would be exclusively sold through Jungle USA's shopping mall.

If people bought them and couldn't play the files due to extension issues, they would be baffled.

Knowing this was crucial for negotiating with record companies, so Lee Hyun-woo explained in detail to Joe Murphy.

Knock, knock.

There was a knock on the door.

"Yes, come in."

Usually, they didn't disturb when external guests were present, but the knock indicated a serious issue.

Indeed, someone entered, and it was Oh Min-woo, who fit the bill for such conduct.

"President, don't you want to see a hacker?"

"What?"

"We are under attack now. I thought you might be curious, so I came up urgently to show you the scene."

"...!"

"...!"

Oh Min-woo deliberately spoke in English.

Both Lee Hyun-woo and Joe Murphy were intrigued.

No, the latter looked even more interested.

"That's a bold person. Daring to hack Jungle. President, shall we go down?"

"Shall we?"

As he stood up, Lee Hyun-woo saw the look on Oh Min-woo's face.

It was meaningful.

"Could this guy have lured the hacker here?"

If asked if that's possible, Lee Hyun-woo wouldn't know.

But recently, Oh Min-woo had said,

"There is nothing that can't be done through programming."

So, he couldn't help but suspect the current situation.

"Anyway, if we catch the hacker by any means..."

Naturally, shouldn't they bring that hacker into Jungle?
