A moment later, the song that Oh Jung-hwan couldn't praise enough soaked the eardrums of Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young.

Oh Jung-hwan’s words that the singer could be reborn not as a video singer but as an audio singer were true.

However,

‘It can’t be the same as that song from my previous life.’

It couldn’t be “The Love Forgiven by Heaven” that would take Lee Hyun-woo back to those days.

Nevertheless, should I say that I felt the greatness of the arrangement?

This song, with lyrics written by Kim Yoon-sun and colored by Oh Jung-hwan, definitely smelled like a big hit.

After it ended, Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young clapped in admiration.

“Wow, really… This is completely different from the song I first heard. Ah, I mean it’s better.”

“Arrangement can make a song better, but it can’t touch a song with a weird base. This is all thanks to you, CEO Lee, who made the original.”

Even as he spoke, Oh Jung-hwan kept sending looks of ‘respect’ to Lee Hyun-woo.

Therefore, it seemed like he shouldn’t stay longer.

“I enjoyed listening. Ah, Yoon-sun, I’ll be going now.”

“Already?”

“If I stay here longer, I feel like I’ll have to compose. But as you know, this isn’t what I’m supposed to be doing. I’m busy with other things.”

“That… that’s right.”

“So, just to be clear. This song has nothing to do with me. You and Mr. Oh Jung-hwan made it. Got it?”

“Still, that’s a bit…”

“CEO, I just did the arrangement.”

“Hey, as I said before, I have a lot of things to do. But what if this song becomes a huge hit? There might be people rushing in asking me to make songs for them. Right?”

“……”

“……”

It seemed forced, but they understood Lee Hyun-woo’s intention.

It meant he didn’t want to be mentioned in the media as the original creator of this song because it would be bothersome.

However, Kim Yoon-sun brought it up one more time.

“I think I’ll feel guilty every time I receive royalties.”

“Ah, then I have a good idea.”

“What is it?”

“Use it for the development fund of the music industry. Of course, you should donate it under your name or Mr. Oh Jung-hwan’s name. Got it?”

Kim Yoon-sun nodded reluctantly.

“Phew, alright.”

* * *

As they walked out, Kim Ah-young asked Lee Hyun-woo.

“You won’t starve later even if you make songs.”

“Of course not.”

“You really don’t know humility.”

“I’m just stating facts.”

In reality, in this completely changed music industry, Lee Hyun-woo could churn out numerous hit songs in this era where original songs had vanished.

“But this should just be a hobby. If it becomes my main job, I don’t think it’ll be enjoyable.”

“True.”

“Instead, when I retire someday, I’ll make one song at a time. Ah, for that, I should learn how to compose. I’m completely ignorant about it.”

“It’s unbelievable that someone who knows nothing made this song.”

“When it keeps lingering in your mind and mouth, this is what happens. But next time, I’ll have to write it down as notes and make it.”

Repeating it several times, it seemed like he really intended to do it.

‘If it’s Hyun-woo, he can do it.’

Naturally.

Honestly, this was more like a cheat key from living a second life rather than Lee Hyun-woo’s ability.

For reference, that day Lee Hyun-woo came home and wrote down various things in his notebook.

― Additional things I want to try in the future: Composing, writing scenarios and novels

* * *

Meanwhile, that night, Kim Tae-hyun began recounting the details of the party from the previous day to Chairman Kim Sung-moo.

“Father, your prediction seems accurate. Nostradamus is more likely to be that guy than Ah-young.”

Kim Sung-moo kept his mouth shut with a sharp look.

It seemed almost certain that it wasn’t his daughter, Kim Ah-young.

If so, the identity of ‘Nostradamus’ was back in the realm of mystery.

― Somehow, I feel it’s that guy.

He had shared his hunch with Kim Tae-hyun before he went to the party.

And he had instructed him to closely observe Lee Hyun-woo’s every move.

“Even though he spoke in several languages, the discussion about curbing the yen’s weakness at the G7 in Berlin or the IMF’s recommended foreign exchange reserve limits were not things someone his age would say. And later, when I asked Uncle Jae-won, he said that what Hyun-woo said was almost identical to the upcoming news headlines.”

“Hm…”

“He also summarized several headline topics into one speech. That means he has a perfect grasp of the global economic situation.”

Kim Sung-moo nodded, occasionally testing his son.

“And what’s another implication?”

“It could mean that a global economic crisis might be coming.”

“Correct.”

As his son gave the correct answer, Kim Sung-moo nodded with a satisfied look.

‘But it’s just that he understood what Hyun-woo grasped.’

It didn’t matter.

Having competent people around and the ability to properly utilize them was enough qualification to be the head of Guseong.

“But father, let’s just overlook the fact that he’s hiding that he’s Nostradamus. Bringing it up would just make things uncomfortable.”

“I was planning to pretend not to know. Then what about him hanging out with Ah-young like that?”

“Well, I’m not sure about that either…”

He didn’t particularly want to intervene in his younger sister’s romance.

“Alright. Let’s keep an eye on that as well.”

“Yes…”

“But, I need to see him again.”

“Pardon?”

“Mi-sam Group, which has been barely holding on, is sure to go bankrupt soon. I want to hear what he thinks about it.”

“Ah…”

Saying he wanted to hear meant arranging another meeting.

Kim Tae-hyun adjusted his glasses and quickly responded.

“I’ll contact him about it tomorrow.”

* * *

It was Monday again.

Kim Tae-hyun once again clung to Lee Hyun-woo, asking him to come to his house.

The reason he had to actively court him despite it being embarrassing was,

‘Hyun-woo, this guy, he’s starting to show signs.’

Just enough so that Kim Tae-hyun wouldn’t feel bad, he said he wouldn’t attend gatherings like the last time.

He also used the excuse of being busy.

To entice him, he mentioned that the design work for the data center would start next week and that they could discuss it at his Hannam-dong residence.

“Oh, before you go, stop by my father’s place. He has something to say to you.”

“To me?”

“Yes, it seems business-related.”

“Ah, alright….”

Lee Hyun-woo mumbled, thinking.

The Guseong Group seemed to be working exhaustively both at the company and at home.

‘I must never live such a life.’

It was a lifestyle that seemed perfect for a short lifespan.

Even seeing Chairman Kim Sung-moo a little later confirmed it.

When he was just over seventy, he had only prolonged his life through hospital care.

‘I don’t know how it will be in this life, but this man must have collapsed because of work addiction.’

There were hardly any heads of conglomerates who weren’t like this.

So, Lee Hyun-woo repeatedly vowed to maintain a work-life balance as he entered Kim Sung-moo’s office.

Anyway, was it because of this determination?

When Kim Sung-moo, who had been staring at his face for a while, asked,

“What is your dream?”

“Being a dutiful son, a good husband, and a respected father.”

The answer he had been holding in his heart flowed out without hesitation.

Kim Sung-moo’s expression changed.

As before, Lee Hyun-woo’s answer was always unexpected.

“I’m asking about your business-related dream.”

“Retiring before forty. And as I said earlier, living as a dutiful son, a good husband, and a respected father.”

“Is there no ambition you want to achieve before that?”

Being a dutiful son, a good husband, and a respected father is extremely difficult, but the conglomerate head in front of him seemed to take it lightly.

Inevitably, Lee Hyun-woo gave the answer he wanted to hear.

“In the short term, I fully agree with the chairman's sense of crisis and aim to prevent a foreign exchange crisis in our country.”

“Foreign exchange crisis?”

“Yes, a foreign exchange crisis. The exchange rate rises uncontrollably, large conglomerates collapse helplessly, and naturally, the country is in jeopardy. What do you think, Chairman?”

Kim Sung-moo’s eyes deepened.

‘He seems to be testing me rather than wanting my answer.’

But it didn’t seem like he was waiting for an answer.

“I’ve heard rumors that Mi-sam Group is in jeopardy. If they go bankrupt, the shock to our financial sector and the overall economy will be no joke.”

Kim Sung-moo had sensed it and instructed the economic research institute to provide a future outlook.

Unfortunately, it was exactly as Lee Hyun-woo had said.

Basically, the imminent expiration of short-term debts of domestic companies was a pressing issue.

If that happened, foreign capital would flow out rapidly.

“Then, what should be done to achieve your goal?”

“First, we must acknowledge the impending crisis. Additionally, to address the lack of liquidity, we must hold onto foreign exchange. This applies to both the state and companies. After increasing our foreign exchange reserves, we need to prevent the outflow of foreign capital. If not, we need to attract foreign investment.”

“It doesn’t seem logical. Is there any foreign capital that wouldn’t withdraw during a crisis?”

“Basically, our company, Jungle, is desperate to attract foreign investment.”

Having already investigated Lee Hyun-woo and Jungle, he knew it was true.

But hearing it directly from Lee Hyun-woo made him seem different from last time.

‘Last time, he was quiet and modest. Seems like he tricked me.’

However, it wasn’t unpleasant.

In fact, it was quite pleasing.

Should I say it was the confidence to solve anything?

“So you mean that if companies like Jungle attract foreign investment, the dollars going out and the dollars coming in could offset each other to some extent.”

“Yes. I believe Guseong Electronics could also attract substantial investment recently. Developing high-level memory semiconductors, servers made with such technology, etc. Wouldn’t foreign investment firms see them as highly competitive?”

Kim Sung-moo did not answer.

Instead, he continued with his questions.

“If you were foreign capital, where would you invest? Apart from your company and ours.”

“I’m closely watching three companies. One is Samjin Computer, another is Alpha Cast, and the last is One Computer.”

“They are all related to your company.”

“Yes, that’s correct.”

A short answer, but it also showed confidence.

In other words, it meant he could greatly grow those three companies if he got involved.

“Good. I’ll keep an eye on it.”

It seemed best to stop here for today.

So, Kim Sung-moo stood up.

It was a sign to leave.

Lee Hyun-woo, quick-witted, bowed his head.

“It was a pleasure.”

“Let’s meet again.”

As he watched Lee Hyun-woo’s back, Kim Sung-moo sighed softly.

‘He’s an unpredictable guy.’

Actually, he had saved a question for last.

He wanted to ask what he thought about Kim Ah-young.

But asking such a question at this stage might imply that he recognized their relationship.

If that led to them openly dating?

‘I still need to see more. Still.’

Especially, if what Lee Hyun-woo said earlier was sincere,

‘A dutiful son, a good husband, and a respected father.’

It wasn’t clear if he was the best match for Kim Ah-young.

So, he had no choice but to keep watching.
