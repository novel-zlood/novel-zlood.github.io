The world is one where value is determined by negotiation skills.

Lee Hyun-woo was known as a technician in the relevant field and, after being reborn, he aimed to elevate it to an art form.

"Do you know that Einstein conducted monumental research at Princeton University?"

"Ah, yes..."

"Then this will be easier to explain."

The genius of the era, Einstein, was asked about his desired salary at Princeton University, and he quoted $3,000.

However, Princeton University brought him on board for $10,000, more than three times what he asked for.

At the time, no matter how outstanding a scholar was, they could generally be recruited for around $7,000. Princeton University's $10,000 offer was a shocking decision.

In retrospect, that decision was hailed as exceptional.

Einstein remained loyal and produced monumental research results throughout his life.

Joe Murphy, who knew this well, asked Lee Hyun-woo with a slight bitter smile.

"If we invest $100 million to enter the U.S. market, does that mean we can win Jungle's loyalty forever?"

"Forever? No. Only as long as I'm the head of Jungle."

Today's investment negotiation table saw some unusual discussions.

The 'superior' offering the money did not act superior, while the 'inferior' receiving the money acted like the superior.

To some, this level of confidence might seem excessive.

Surprisingly, Joe Murphy nodded and said,

"I will invest under the conditions you mentioned."

"......!"

"......!"

"......!"

"......!"

Everyone was shocked, their faces showing exclamation marks.

However, Joe Murphy continued, unaffected by others' expressions.

"But, please adjust the equity."

"That's something we can negotiate. The investment amount as well."

Joe Murphy finally understood what Lee Hyun-woo had been consistently saying from the beginning.

- No investment for the headquarters.

He seemed to understand why as well.

It was because Lee disliked interference.

This mindset seemed similar to the recent attitudes of the two geniuses from Stanford University, Ray Burrin and Mikhail Pace.

The difference was that Lee Hyun-woo was open to discussions regarding the U.S. branch.

"Additionally, we will participate in the management of Jungle USA through the Natural Standard Fund."

"Not bad. However, our role will be to advise when the company is heading in the wrong direction."

"Thank you."

"In return, please open up the opportunity for us to invest in Jungle's headquarters someday."

"That day will surely come. Sooner than you think."

"Come to think of it, it's better to help from the start rather than just advising when the company goes astray."

"In what ways can you help?"

"We are currently investing in the top three record labels in the U.S."

Hearing Joe Murphy's words, a smile grew on Lee Hyun-woo's face.

"That's great. Once Jungle USA is properly established, we're planning to start Jungle Music, so we could really use your help. Considering the American market, Jungle USA's performance might even surpass the headquarters'."

This time, a similar smile appeared on Joe Murphy's face.

'Have I managed to win his heart?'

It seems the negotiations will now be left to the working-level staff.

* * *

The negotiations over lunch afterward ended amicably.

After parting ways with Lee Hyun-woo, Joe Murphy began to explain to his curious subordinates.

"You're wondering why I invested $100 million in Jungle USA and not the headquarters, right? The answer is simple. I was convinced of Lee Hyun-woo's value during the negotiation. He acted as if our investment wasn't necessary, but his attitude wasn't rude or arrogant. He showed confidence that with the investment, they could quickly establish themselves as the top portal site in the U.S."

"Could it just be talk?"

"Of course. You never know until you try, and just because it worked in Korea doesn't mean it will work in the U.S. But it did work in Japan, didn't it?"

Indeed. Jungle Japan was rapidly increasing its performance through advertising.

"This era is moving towards spaces where people gather not needing to be offline. In fact, the impact of online spaces is faster than offline. Let me ask you one thing. What was Yahoo's performance last year?"

"It slightly exceeded $60 million."

"And what's Yahoo's current market cap?"

"$20 billion..."

"What do you think?"

"It's a bubble."

"It's a bubble."

"Of course, it's a bubble."

"Yes, it's a bubble. But why do people invest in that bubble?"

"Because there's an overflow of cash liquidity and not many places to invest."

"They're investing in future value rather than the present."

"With bank interest rates at the bottom, there aren't many good places to invest."

"Excellent. But that's not the exact answer I want."

After taking a breath, Joe Murphy continued.

"It's very simple. It's because of greed for money."

"......"

"......"

"......"

"And when people realize that greed is misplaced, they'll understand that the stocks they hold are like bombs. We just need to decide before then. Either quickly pass the bomb to another greedy person or dismantle the fuse."

Everyone nodded, indicating they understood roughly.

"So, our immediate task is to stir up Jungle USA aggressively."

"I'll inform the media."

"I'll create analysis reports and explain them to investors."

"I'll visit the big three record labels you mentioned."

Finally, Joe Murphy nodded with a satisfied smile.

'Even though I gave you all a long explanation, it was just rationalization for my investment.'

The real reason for investing in Jungle USA was just one thing.

It was intuition.

'Somehow, I feel that Hyun-woo Lee will dismantle the fuse himself before we need to.'

In his 30 years as a fund manager,

He had more major successes relying on intuition than through logical analysis and rational understanding.

This time he had a similar feeling.

'If my intuition is wrong, then it's time for me to retire.'

* * *

After the afternoon schedule ended, Lee Hyun-woo also had to discuss the investment with the remaining three people.

During this process, Lee Hyun-woo also needed to satisfy the curiosity of the three.

That was why Joe Murphy invested $100 million.

Lee Hyun-woo responded.

"I think he trusted his intuition."

"Intuition?"

"Investors usually rely on analysis and data, right? But those at the highest level rely on intuition. I think that's correct. No matter how much data is accumulated from the present and past, it doesn't apply when measuring a new model for a new era. In such cases, one must rely on their intuition."

"Are you saying that Joe Murphy showed 'confidence' in Jungle's success?"

Shin Dong-woon interjected.

Lee Hyun-woo nodded and said,

"Of course. Our company's success is certain. Isn't that something everyone here already knows, including myself?"

"That's right."

"Of course."

"Ah, yes..."

Honestly, who can predict a company's future so confidently? But not wanting to be the only one who didn't know, Shin Dong-woon nodded.

Then Lee Hyun-woo's voice was heard again.

"There are uncertainties, though."

"What are they?"

"The scale of success."

"Pardon?"

"We don't know how big the success will be. Ideally, it would be great if we could succeed quickly and achieve my goals."

As soon as Lee Hyun-woo mentioned his goals, curiosity arose.

Then he recalled.

"Wasn't your goal to be a filial son, a good husband, and a respected father?"

"Yes, that's part of it, and also retiring early. So these days, I'm thinking about the criteria for retirement."

"Haha..."

"It's still too early to talk about retirement."

"Exactly. You dragged me into this and now want to withdraw alone?"

Feeling he was the only one left out, Shin Dong-woon vowed not to ask any more questions.

Then Lee Hyun-woo spoke again in a calm voice.

"Don't worry. I won't retire and leave you with a heavy burden. I'll only step back when I'm confident the company runs smoothly without me."

"Let's change the topic."

"Right. Ah, $100 million! How will we build Jungle USA with that? Now that we have the funds, speeding things up should be easy."

"Right. First, let's halve the number of employees dispatched to AltaVista."

Six employees had been dispatched to AltaVista to integrate Jungle's search engine.

Lee Hyun-woo's intention was clear.

It meant the remaining half would build Jungle USA.

"Development needs to be done there, but only you can oversee the whole thing, right?"

"Exactly. We need someone stationed in the U.S. I'm needed more in Korea, and Team Leader Lee Jung-woo needs to continue his studies."

"We're people who dream of building an online world. There's no need to work in Korea."

Seeing that the two were trying to back out, Lee Hyun-woo quickly laid the groundwork.

His target was Oh Min-woo.

Currently, he is on a leave of absence from school.

Although he had considered dropping out, he seemed to have changed his mind slightly.

However, until he returns to school, there's some leeway, so Lee Hyun-woo quickly ordered.

"I also need to work out. I've already made a promise with my trainer to get in shape this year."

He's making up ridiculous excuses.

Then he recommends someone.

"Team Leader Woo is the best fit."

"Oh? I just thought the same thing."

Lee Jung-woo immediately chimed in.

Lee Hyun-woo could only smile.

"Got it. Let's decide after seeing the progress. Ah, Team Leader Shin."

"Yes?"

"If you know any good talents, please recommend them. We need someone who understands the flow of funds to assist."

"Ah... Yes, I'll look into it."

The atmosphere was starting to settle.

Sending Woo Sang-won, who was in Korea, to the U.S. to oversee the construction of Jungle USA and placing someone knowledgeable about money next to him would solve everything.

'I guess I'll have to make frequent trips to check up.'

It looks like trips to the U.S. will become more frequent.

Having already stepped in, he needs to ensure a stable conclusion before retiring.

Naturally, his retirement criteria are set.

'I'll retire after making it to the top IT company.'

However,

According to what Lee Hyun-woo recently thought,

Doesn't this mean he'll retire after becoming the world's best?
