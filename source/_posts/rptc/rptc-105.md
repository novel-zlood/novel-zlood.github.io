Lee Hyun-woo felt uneasy, so he went to see Kim Ah-young after work the next day.

It seemed like it was his first time going to 【Seorabeol Hotel】 without any particular purpose.

Then, the following day, Kim Ah-young came to see him without any particular purpose.

‘Maybe meeting like this every day will lead to a relationship somewhere between friends and lovers?’

Strictly speaking, she could still be called a female friend.

Lee Hyun-woo thought that this kind of relationship wouldn't be bad.

If they were to define their relationship, it seemed like it would be burdensome for both of them.

‘Eventually, a moment of decision will come.’

* * *

The next day, Woo Sang-won and Jang Yoo-chul departed for Germany.

They planned to visit two research institutes before returning.

One was 【Dachshund Institute】, where a forum on the openness of portal sites would be held.

The other was 【Front Hof Institute】.

Since it was the place that developed MPEG, it was essential to visit it to justify the legitimacy of 【Jungle Music】, which services MP3s.

On the way back after dropping them off at the airport, Lee Hyun-woo told Lee Jung-woo about it.

“From now on, copyrights should be treated as valuable assets.”

“I know. It's something you consider very important, hyung. That's why you were running around for the rights of copyright holders last time.”

This referred to the 50% distribution rate given to singers, composers, and lyricists when a song is sold.

“It seems like more singers are debuting since then.”

“Ayy, they must have been preparing originally.”

“That might be true, but Team Leader Han said that the number of people dreaming of becoming singers, composers, and lyricists has increased tremendously.”

“Really?”

“Yes.”

So, in this life, will he see new faces of singers more often?

Maybe he could accelerate the spread of Hallyu even earlier.

Thinking this, Lee Hyun-woo smiled brightly and said,

“It wouldn't be bad for us if many appear.”

“Right. Currently, the structure is that as much as is supplied, it is sold. By the way, what's with this song?”

“Huh? What's wrong?”

“The song is kind of... never mind.”

Lee Hyun-woo frowned slightly as he listened to the song playing on the radio.

The song was by DJ Brothers,

‘It sounds similar yet different.’

It was similar to a song he heard in his past life but had some differences.

Such songs had become more frequent recently.

He wondered if this phenomenon occurred because he returned to the past.

Although the world he was reborn into seemed like a parallel universe, not everyone could act or speak in the same way.

Just as his younger brother’s character had changed, so had the creative works.

Songs, dramas, movies, novels, etc.

‘Tch, reruns are better for these things.’

As he aged, Lee Hyun-woo enjoyed the 90s sentiment more.

But since his return, he had lived immersed in that sentiment.

‘Sigh.’

Maybe he had to live in a new world where the songs he heard wouldn’t play, and the movies he watched wouldn’t be released.

That was quite... disappointing.

* * *

When he got home and logged into 【Jungle Music】, it had gotten worse.

‘Wow, I don’t know any of the recent songs.’

It seemed that last year’s songs were released as they had been prepared beforehand.

However, since Lee Hyun-woo appeared, the preparation process seemed to have changed.

‘Is this some kind of butterfly effect?’

Just as the flap of a small butterfly's wings can create a hurricane, it seemed Lee Hyun-woo’s influence had completely spread to the music industry, drastically reducing the chances of appreciating the masterpieces of the era.

Looking more closely, the songs that should have been released at the end of last year didn’t exist.

‘Damn.’

Then, a sudden thought struck him.

If a song was a hit in his past life, wouldn’t it be popular in this life too?

‘Then I just need to make it come out.’

Not that he planned to make money by creating songs.

He just wanted some of the songs he enjoyed listening to in this life to be released. So he picked up the phone and called someone.

(Hello?)

It was a female singer he knew, Kim Yoon-sun, who answered.

“Are you busy right now?”

(No, I’m taking a break from recording.)

During New Year's, they had exchanged texts, and Kim Yoon-sun had mentioned that she was working on an album aiming for next month.

(Do you have something to say?)

“Yeah, I suddenly remembered a song, but I’m not sure if I heard it somewhere or if it’s just in my head.”

(What?)

“I’ll sing a bit of it. Can you listen and tell me if it’s a song that already exists?”

(…….)

The silence from the other end suggested she found it a bit absurd.

But Lee Hyun-woo didn’t care and started singing.

“Because of that man, I might lose a friend~ The friend I relied on in difficult times.”

He recalled this part of the chorus.

The title was "Love Forgiven by Heaven."

“This is the highlight... Have you heard it before?”

(No?)

“Ah, really?”

He contacted Kim Yoon-sun to check if he had missed anything,

(But it sounds good? Is it a guy’s song?)

She seemed to think it was a man’s song since he sang it in a lower key.

So Lee Hyun-woo decided to go for it.

“No, no. Actually, the melody and lyrics keep lingering in my head.”

(Really?)

“Yes, I keep checking 【Jungle Music】, wondering if I heard it somewhere... Do you know the feeling of humming a song you think you’ve heard before but can’t quite place?”

(Of course. And if you can’t figure out what it is, it drives you crazy. Anyway, while we’re at it, keep singing the other parts.)

“I don’t have the full lyrics, and earlier, I just made them up as I went along. Should I just hum it?”

(Sure, go ahead.)

“Alright. Even if I’m tone-deaf, please understand.”

(As I mentioned before, your low voice is really charming. Keep singing in that key.)

Encouraged by her words, Lee Hyun-woo began to hum with greater confidence.

“Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, drawn to him, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, I wished for it.”

Interspersing some remembered lyrics, he continued singing, and he could hear Kim Yoon-sun’s breathing become quieter.

Lee Hyun-woo seemed determined to revive this song.

He was doing something over the phone that he wouldn’t have done in his previous life.

‘Anyway, doing things I didn’t do in my previous life is the goal of this life.’

Thinking this, Lee Hyun-woo finished singing.

(Wow, this song is really good.)

“Really?”

(Did you... create this song?)

“I don’t know.”

(What do you mean you don’t know?)

“As I said earlier, I might have heard it somewhere. It might have been in a dream.”

(That’s nonsense.)

“It’s true. Also, it feels like a woman sang it in my dream. So can you sing it in your key and record it? You can piece the lyrics together as you see fit.”

This was actually Lee Hyun-woo’s plan.

‘Although she’s not the original singer, I can listen to this song recorded in Yoon-sun’s voice in the future, right?’

With a meaningful smile, he waited for her response, and an unexpected proposal came.

(Hyun-woo, I suddenly got a strong feeling about this song. If it really has no owner, can I sing it?)

“Sure, I called you to sing and record it.”

(No, I mean I want to include it in my next album.)

“What? Really?”

(Yes, really.)

“Haha…”

It would be a lie to say he hadn’t imagined this scenario.

But he didn’t expect it to progress so quickly.

Originally, he intended for Kim Yoon-sun to keep singing the song until she got used to it, then subtly suggest including it in her album.

‘It’s unfolding so smoothly!’

With a clenched fist, a smile spread across Lee Hyun-woo’s face.

“Then I guess we can’t keep talking over the phone? When you have time, come to our office.”

(Okay. I’ll go to your office tomorrow.)

She seemed to genuinely like the song, given her eagerness.

‘But what about the lyrics?’

That part was somewhat disappointing.

No matter how good Lee Hyun-woo’s memory was, he couldn’t remember all the lyrics of a particular song.

But the charm of this song lay in its lyrics.

The theme included a touch of taboo, about falling in love with a friend’s man.

‘I’ll have to explain it in detail tomorrow.’

* * *

The next day, unexpectedly, Kim Ah-young ended up listening too.

Since she had been coming almost daily without any particular purpose, he couldn’t stop her, and things turned out that way.

‘Oh dear.’

Lee Hyun-woo realized it took more courage to do it in front of someone than not seeing their face.

Nevertheless, he used the karaoke machine microphone in the basement cafe, mixing ‘hmm hmm’ sounds with lyrics to sing.

Both Kim Yoon-sun and Kim Ah-young clapped and liked it.

“Hey, this is good, right?”

“Right? Right?”

“It kept lingering in my head and on the tip of my tongue, driving me crazy. I thought it would be better for a current singer to sing it, so I called you yesterday.”

“You did well, Hyun-woo.”

“I can’t wait to hear this song recorded in Yoon-sun’s voice.”

Today, Lee Hyun-woo had introduced the two as friends right away when they met.

It was to create a natural and comfortable conversation atmosphere.

So, Kim Ah-young spoke informally to Kim Yoon-sun without hesitation, and Kim Yoon-sun smiled warmly, creating a friendly scene.

“For reference, I searched all day yesterday to see if there was an original creator of this song, but I couldn’t find one. I even searched foreign songs just in case.”

“Really? Is that possible?”

“Yes, our company’s search engine is very smart. If you enter the commands correctly, it will find it.”

Although it didn’t quite make sense, Kim Yoon-sun seemed to believe him with a somewhat naive look.

Without missing a beat, Lee Hyun-woo quickly explained the meaning of the song.

Then he added,

“I’ll leave the rest of the lyrics to you.”

“To me?”

“Yes, this time, you can take credit for both composing and writing the lyrics.”

“How can I do that? The song is practically made by you.”

“How would I know about composing? I just sang what came to my mind. I was the worst at music in school, you know. I don’t even know musical notes well. You put the notes together and complete it properly, okay?”

“……”

Kim Yoon-sun stared silently at Lee Hyun-woo.

Then she turned her gaze to Kim Ah-young.

As if she needed her approval too.

It was unclear how she interpreted it, but Kim Ah-young continued in a bright voice,

“I’m looking forward to it. I really want to hear you sing this song. Will you do it?”

Kim Yoon-sun smiled bashfully and nodded.

“Alright. I’ll raise the pitch to fit a female key and try it. And I’ll attach proper lyrics.”

“How long will it take? Ah, I’m asking out of excitement, not impatience. I’m looking forward to it.”

When Lee Hyun-woo asked again, Kim Yoon-sun responded with a confident voice while still smiling,

“I have a feeling it won’t take long.”

Her voice was filled with certainty.

The reason was simple.

Today, seeing the interaction between Lee Hyun-woo and Kim Ah-young, she felt that their relationship was not ordinary.

‘For some reason, I feel like I can perfectly incorporate my current feelings into this song.’
