"You're going to give 50% of the distribution to the people who sing and make the songs?"

An exclamation mark appeared in Han Se-jin's eyes, having spent time building relationships with singers and understanding their settlement rates.

Initially, even the singers themselves didn't know how they were being settled.

Over time, as he continued to interact with singers and took notes, he later calculated the settlement rates and found out that in some cases, the agencies were taking almost everything, to the point of being deceptive.

‘I don't know about anything else, but no singer would dislike a 50% distribution rate.’

The issue was whether the Korean Singers Association could raise their voice.

Because they too had close relationships with the agencies.

"Oh, by the way, please mention that we will donate 100 million won for the development of the Korean Singers Association. Of course, you should spread the word widely, and the content we are pushing must be conveyed to each singer."

"Yes, I will proceed right away!"

Lee Hyun-woo smiled as he watched Han Se-jin turn his back to get busy again.

‘To change the existing system, you just need to involve all the interest groups.’

It seems complex, but in situations like this, the louder voice always wins.

This time, it was clear that the prices would be adjusted due to the Korean Singers Association raising their voice instead of Jungle.

* * *

Shortly after, the update Han Se-jin received was as follows:

<Position of the Korean Singers Association>

First, the Korean Singers Association supports the new form of online sales!

Second, the price per song proposed by the Korean Singers Association is 300 won. This is a compromise since Jungle's proposed price of 100 won per song was too low, and the agency's price of 600 won was too high.

Third, the Korean Singers Association highly supports Jungle's proposed 50% artist sales distribution rate!

Judging by the organized details, it seemed there had been many discussions. Han Se-jin looked at Lee Hyun-woo with an exhausted expression.

"As expected, almost all agencies are protesting, saying it's nonsense."

"Will the singers win? Or will the agencies win?"

It will be down to which side has more money.

Naturally, the latter.

"I'm not sure, but if the agencies continue to oppose, the singers are planning to take collective action."

"Oh, that's great. Then we can support the singers."

"CEO, isn't it a bit too much to pick fights with the agencies?"

"No, we need to change this strange settlement practice disguised as a custom. That way, the singers won't be exploited. Don't worry. The end is in sight now."

However, the end here did not mean reaching a consensus.

Lee Hyun-woo knew well that the entrenched interests in this world would not easily yield what they held.

Most would resist and disappear, or some would compromise and survive.

‘I guess I'll be the one to speed up that timing.’

* * *

Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho began to move energetically again.

They had no choice, as the other four team leaders were holding their ground in Jungle with the weapon of 'technology,' so these two had to prove another weapon to Lee Hyun-woo.

After the two meetings ended, they both showed their capabilities by hitting the ground running.

First, Han Se-jin met Jo Hyun-woo, the CEO of Nine Sound.

In the past, Jo Hyun-woo would not have dared to meet someone like Han Se-jin, but Jungle, which had quickly dominated large-scale music distribution, had become the 'boss' in no time.

Han Se-jin spoke confidently in front of Jo Hyun-woo.

"CEO Jo, times are changing."

"Yes, that's true. Jungle has changed the world. The music industry, at least, is changing day by day."

"You are mistaken. It's not us who have changed, but the public who demanded change. We just developed the technology people wanted and created a market that was easier to access."

Was he too confident?

Now it had become a habit.

At Jungle, anyone could freely express their opinions.

Once soaked in that atmosphere, they would persuade others confidently yet courteously.

It was the same now, and Jo Hyun-woo couldn't help but let out a wry smile mixed with lament.

"That was fine. But we, who originally dominated the market, are about to suffer huge losses."

"Is that so? The agencies and music industry figures are seeing their sales increase day by day. Compare the before and after. Did they really suffer any losses?"

"People naturally think about what they might lose in the future based on their current gains and what they must get."

"That's right. People can think that way. In that sense, those who consume music are the same. And so are the singers who create the music. Strictly speaking, aren't you, CEO Jo, the one standing at the center of all this?"

What Han Se-jin said was true.

Jo Hyun-woo was responsible for composing, writing, and producing music at Nine Sound.

"Our CEO said that even in Korea, an artist who can earn hundreds of billions of won by creating and singing a single song, like Michael Jackson in the USA, should emerge. To achieve that, we need to lower the barriers for consumers to access the market."

"That's so true that it's hard to argue against. The same goes for online sales, which have lowered the barriers for people to access the market. But it's regrettable that the 'price' is included in one of those barriers. Make sure to inform CEO Lee of this point."

Did Lee Hyun-woo push forward without knowing that?

Han Se-jin did not back down and argued on behalf of Lee Hyun-woo.

"Price must be included to succeed. Look at it from a broader perspective. Currently, our country's music is not only consumed in Korea. It is already gaining considerable popularity in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan."

This was also an undeniable fact.

Especially in the case of Clones, they were enjoying popularity akin to Michael Jackson in Taiwan.

"Have you ever thought about how great it would be to convert that popularity into money? Simply by performing and appearing on shows, and letting the distributors in Taiwan and Hong Kong sell our artists' albums, how much did you actually make?"

"Hmm..."

As the representative of Clones' agency, Jo Hyun-woo could only let out a groan.

In reality, the amount was far too small compared to their popularity.

"Online, there are no borders. Wouldn't it be possible to predict the future as well? The threshold to enter the global market will be lower. Profits will grow, and we can quickly earn large sums of money, and an artist like Michael Jackson could emerge in Korea."

Lee Hyun-woo had once said that with the advancement of technology, online could also develop borders.

That was something Han Se-jin neither understood nor experienced, nor did he need to speak about it now.

So, had the persuasion worked?

Jo Hyun-woo sighed again and spoke.

"In a few days, the agencies will also hold a counter-meeting."

"We anticipated that."

"For now, I plan not to attend."

"Huh?"

"Didn't expect that, did you?"

"No, definitely not."

"Alright, I believe this should be an adequate answer. Phew, talking with you makes me tired. It feels just like after having a conversation with CEO Lee."

Hearing Jo Hyun-woo's weary voice, Han Se-jin smiled faintly.

‘Subordinates tend to resemble their leaders.’

* * *

That evening, Kang Dong-ho, who also resembled the CEO, brought similar results and met with Han Se-jin.

In their busy schedules, the thing that made them happy was a refreshing beer.

"Gulp!"

"Gulp!"

"It's tough."

"Yes, it is."

"But Team Leader Han, isn't it rewarding?"

"Of course it is."

Kang Dong-ho had met with the CEO of MS Entertainment.

He mentioned that there would be a meeting in a few days, where the agency representatives and music industry figures would all attend.

But thanks to Kang Dong-ho's persuasion, the CEO of MS Entertainment had decided to not attend.

"I didn't expect CEO Yoon to make the same decision as CEO Jo."

"Isn't it inevitable? Both places are making tremendous profits because of Jungle. And it will snowball even more in the future."

"Yes, that's true. But it seems that the other agency representatives don't understand. We said the same thing at the last meeting, but they have no intention of accepting it, so it doesn't get through."

In fact, the content that Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho had spoken about had also been discussed at the previous meeting.

But the agency representatives were half-listening and half-ignoring, only asserting their own opinions.

"Frankly, I understand if it's the music distribution companies. Even the music production companies, if you look further ahead. They are bound to take a big hit someday, aren't they?"

"I do feel sorry for them. But we can't take responsibility for the jobs lost due to the development of new industries. When Edison invented the light bulb, he didn’t compensate the candle makers, did he? Oh, is that too cold-hearted?"

"It's not something you should say in front of them. But doesn’t the CEO also speak with a sorrowful expression, saying that many jobs will disappear due to technological advancements?"

"Yes, he said we couldn’t stop developing technology because of that, but we should constantly think about ways for society to absorb it."

You can't compensate the original store owner just because you set up a better-performing store across the street.

One can only feel sorry.

But Lee Hyun-woo was constantly thinking about it.

As he always had, their trusted CEO would someday find an answer.

If everyone couldn't win, then at least those who benefited should support the minority who suffered.

"By the way, how many people do you think will attend their meeting?"

"It won't be a small number. But not everyone will have the same sentiment. The successful ones will strongly advocate for uniting and responding to protect their interests, but those who aren't doing well will start looking for an escape route."

Han Se-jin nodded in agreement.

Ultimately, it seemed their job was to persuade the small agencies looking for an escape route.

‘Just like how we also see an escape route.’

* * *

A few days later, the representatives of each agency gathered at an undisclosed location to hold a counter-meeting against Jungle.

Naturally, the well-off agencies took the lead and brought in music production and distribution companies.

However, some did not attend.

It was quite a blow that the largest ones, Nine Sound and the rapidly growing MS Entertainment, did not attend.

Even so, they couldn't stop once they had started the engine.

Thus, the most influential person among the gathered spoke passionately at the front.

"You must know that we can't just take this lying down. Every field has its customs, and we need to show Jungle that they can't ignore them!"

"That's right!"

"Agreed!"

Most voiced their agreement, but some only pretended.

As Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho had anticipated, some were already looking for an escape route.
