The every move of Jungle has become a hot topic, generating numerous articles this time as well.

However, the conclusion was that while anyone could do it, not just anyone could succeed. 

In other words, investors are not fools, and if they continue to attract funds in this manner, they would have to bear the risk of diminishing the company's value. 

The fact that investment funds flocked because it was Jungle is undeniable.

The media gave it another meaning.

It signaled that the Korean economic crisis might have bottomed out, predicting that it was time for stock prices and exchange rates to start stretching. 

With experts also stepping in, there was a phenomenon of rising stock prices and falling exchange rates. 

It still needs to be watched a bit more, but the prevailing sentiment is that the term "foreign exchange crisis," which had been frequently used, would not reach the worst-case scenario. 

In this situation, another icon of the information and communication world, Steven Jobs, came to Korea. 

The main purpose of his visit to Korea was obviously linked to the emergence of the portal site Ocean Korea. 

However, the hidden purpose was to meet Lee Hyun-woo. 

So, after completing the promotional schedule for the portal site, he went directly to Jungle. 

By this time, Jungle had moved to a 23-story building, and the chairman’s office on the top floor became the meeting place for these two icons of innovation. 

Honestly, when Lee Hyun-woo first saw Steven Jobs, his heart pounded wildly. 

It felt like meeting an old lover again. 

‘It feels like meeting a dead person again.’ 

After exchanging greetings and shaking hands, they sat down, but Lee Hyun-woo couldn’t stop staring at Steven Jobs' face. 

Because of that, Steven Jobs had to awkwardly lead the conversation with a forced smile. 

“Ha ha… I heard about your successful fund-raising. I’m somewhat envious.” 

“I was lucky. Somehow, it feels like I’ve become a nouveau riche sitting on a pile of money.” 

“I like your honesty. You’re much better than a certain friend I know.” 

“Who are you talking about?” 

“You must have met him. He has a sneaky snake inside and a boring and rigid image, but in reality, he's a very violent guy who often destroys our ecosystem. I heard you fell victim to him this time as well?” 

“If you’re talking about Billy Kates, I don’t particularly feel like I was victimized.” 

“Ha ha, that’s why you were victimized. Doesn’t he look like a gentlemanly entrepreneur? He’s not. When he was young, he hacked public institutions and large corporations, paid enormous fines for reckless driving, and even got arrested. He’s closer to a gangster than a gentleman.” 

Was he planning to badmouth Billy Kates on purpose? 

Two emotions were evident. 

One was a sense of inferiority from defeat. 

The other was a determination to take revenge. 

‘It’s understandable, given that he was backstabbed by Billy Kates.’ 

Still, he recently joined hands to jointly research a search engine. 

It shows a manager who doesn’t let emotions get in the way when it comes to crucial moments and objectives. 

Conversely, I heard that Billy Kates also saved Pineapple and Steven Jobs, which were in crisis. 

According to a recently reported news, he invested quite a lot of funds and received non-voting shares, acting almost like a sponsor. 

“When that gangster invests funds, there’s definitely an ulterior motive, so be careful.” 

Even that was not taken as goodwill by Steven Jobs. 

‘I thought Billy Kates did it out of guilt for copying Pineapple’s software.’ 

That must be the case. 

Steven Jobs would provoke here and there to make things interesting for future competition. 

“I’m worried that Mr. Lee is more naive than I thought.” 

“Ha ha…” 

Hearing such unexpected words, Lee Hyun-woo couldn’t help but give an awkward smile. 

Naive? 

He lived for more than 50 years in his previous life and was borrowing the success of his second life, yet he was called naive. 

Billy Kates gets flak for copying Pineapple, but strictly speaking, Lee Hyun-woo was doing something even worse. 

He was copying the winning answers from his previous successful life. 

One thing was certain. 

“Thank you for seeing it that way, but I wonder if Pineapple is actually the one with the fire at its feet. I heard Billy Kates invested $150 million this year alone?” 

“Well, initially he said he’d only invest a million dollars, but later he realized our value and significantly increased it.” 

“You’re naive. Do you really think that’s the reason?” 

Steven Jobs raised his eyebrows. 

He was just repaid for his previous statement. 

“At least it’s good that you don’t think Billy invested out of guilt.” 

This time, it stung. 

Actually, Steven Jobs had slightly thought that. 

After all, Macro Soft’s software was born by backstabbing Pineapple at its core. 

Seeing the increase in Pineapple’s value based on that guilt, Billy Kates decided on a large-scale investment. 

“I think it’s preparation for a legal battle against monopoly.” 

“What do you mean…” 

“Billy monopolized the computer operating system. Using that position, he is currently forcing the use of Internet X Cross and MS Office. This is a violation of antitrust laws. Isn’t it?” 

“……” 

“But if he invests in Pineapple and Jungle, he can later say in court that if he intended to monopolize, he wouldn’t have invested in these two companies. By appearing as a company pursuing coexistence, it would be enough to win the hearts of the jurors and prevent the giant company Macro Soft from being split.” 

Steven Jobs’ pupils expanded greatly. 

In hindsight, Lee Hyun-woo’s words made perfect sense. 

In fact, antitrust laws in the U.S. were very strict. 

Due to this law that prohibits monopolies, companies of great figures called ‘kings’ in the oil and railroad industries were forcibly split. 

“I guess I should retract my statement about you being naive.” 

Steven Jobs’ honest acknowledgment was pleasing. 

Moreover, hoping that he would quickly recover in this life, the advice given was as follows. 

“If you want, I can share technology with you anytime. Just like I recently joined hands with Yaho.” 

“Oh…?” 

“Actually, creating a search engine would consume a lot of time and money, so why not try using ours?” 

For a moment, Steven Jobs’ eyes were filled with hesitation. 

It was the easiest way to equip Ocean with a high-tech search engine. 

“At least, I recommend using it in Korea, if not in the U.S. If applied to Ocean Korea, there will surely be visible effects.” 

“Wow, you’re straightforward. Alright, I’ll do that.” 

“Should we delegate this work to the operational team?” 

“Ha ha ha, I never thought things would progress so quickly in one go. I’ve learned a lot today.” 

It’s an honor to hear that from the icon of innovation. 

‘If you think about it, it’s more reasonable for us to join forces.’ 

Can anyone face the mega-villain Billy Kates alone? 

Multiple heroes need to join hands to win. 

That’s the reality now.

* * *

Generally, when talking to big shots, Lee Hyun-woo prefers to have someone nearby rather than talking alone. 

Today, too, he had two chief secretaries by his side. 

So, after Steven Jobs left, Han Se-jin and Kang Dong-ho began to breathe a sigh of relief. 

“Phew…” 

“Wow…” 

“Why?” 

“I felt this when you met Billy Kates last time too, but you speak… without any hesitation.” 

“Yes, I was very nervous. I still am. I’m worried that if he meets Billy Kates later, he might convey what you said.” 

“That won’t happen, and even if it does, it doesn’t matter. Billy Kates and Steven Jobs aren’t such narrow-minded people.” 

“Oh, okay…” 

“I had a question.” 

The reactions of the two chief secretaries were different, each in their own style. 

Han Se-jin answered and then opened a notebook to jot something down, while Kang Dong-ho immediately sought to resolve his curiosity. 

“Go ahead.” 

“The person next to Steven Jobs earlier introduced himself as Jordan Live. You said that the design you always talk about comes from him, right?” 

“Yes, I’ve mentioned that countless times.” 

He was so envious of Pineapple’s strengths and kept self-hypnotizing to catch up, so he had repeatedly recited it. 

“Then, instead of just sharing our search engine, wouldn’t it be better to ask for his skills in return?” 

“We could say that, but not now. It could unnecessarily heighten their guard, and the current goal is to create a rift between Billy Kates and Steven Jobs.” 

“I find it amazing when I see you, CEO. With some people, you interact without calculation, but with others, you’re extremely political like now.” 

“As Steven Jobs said earlier, being too naive makes you an easy target. So, if you’re in a situation where you’ll inevitably get hit, you have to think of a counterattack.” 

“Oh, I’m learning again. If you’re in a situation where you’ll inevitably get hit, think of a counterattack.” 

Kang Dong-ho repeated Lee Hyun-woo’s words. 

In fact, keeping them close was for them to learn in this way. 

Someday, if Lee Hyun-woo steps down from Jungle’s management, the remaining people being naive would be a big disadvantage. 

To overcome it, experience is essential. 

Whether it’s through Han Se-jin’s notes or Kang Dong-ho’s repetitive learning, he hoped these two would become excellent managers when they leave the secretarial office. 

‘But Steven Jobs isn’t that naive either, is he not yet awakened?’ 

It could be that or he might be pretending. 

Since he wasn’t Steven Jobs, he couldn’t be sure. 

For the sake of future interesting dynamics, he hoped Steven Jobs would wake up soon and put Billy Kates on edge. 

Lee Hyun-woo always values ‘fun’ in his second life. 

He believes it’s the most necessary thing to avoid a rerun of life.

* * *

Back on the flight to the U.S., Steven Jobs closed his eyes and pondered deeply. 

‘Hyun-woo Lee, he’s not an easy young man.’ 

Originally, people of that age live on spirit, but intriguingly, he showed maturity. 

That’s probably why he saw through Billy Kates’ intentions. 

Lee Hyun-woo’s words might not have been entirely accurate, but the Billy Kates Steven Jobs knew was indeed the ‘gangster’ he mentioned during the meeting. 

So, surely investing in both IT companies was a move for the future. 

In that case? 

‘I should go to the U.S. and play some media games.’ 

He was internally organizing what to say in interviews. 

‘As everyone knows, there are antitrust laws in the U.S. I believe no company should use underhanded means to monopolize any product or content.’ 

If Billy Kates was planning to go to court, it’s better to send him there a little sooner.
