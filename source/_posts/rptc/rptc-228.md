Kim Ah-young's mind is divided.

One part thinks that finally, due to the all-out offensive from 【Macro Soft】, 【Jungle】 will struggle, which might delay Lee Hyun-woo's retirement.

The other part felt sorry for Lee Hyun-woo for even thinking this way.

Unaware of these complicated thoughts, Kim Tae-hyun spoke again.

"Originally, I was going to ask you to bring it up, but it seems better if I talk to Hyun-woo directly, right?"

"Y-yes, oppa should do it yourself."

She had no intention of delivering bad news to Lee Hyun-woo with her current complicated feelings.

"Alright, got it. Sigh..."

Kim Tae-hyun seemed reluctant as well.

After a sigh, he looked at his father and spoke with a hesitant tone.

"Maybe that's why Hyun-woo told us not to focus too much on PC manufacturing last time. He was afraid we’d have a conflict."

"He couldn't have predicted that far."

"Not exactly, but sometimes you get a bad feeling about things. Hyun-woo is particularly good at those."

"Hahaha."

"Anyway, I'll contact Hyun-woo right away. This isn't something we can delay..."

"That's right. They say he's meeting Billy Kates soon, so it’s better to know before that."

Kim Tae-hyun stood up with his mobile phone.

The unusual thing was that his mobile phone was of a size no one had seen before.

It was a PDA phone.

It wasn't supposed to be released until the first half of next year, but 【Guseong Electronics】 made it just for him with only phone functions added.

This was a strategy conceived when Lee Hyun-woo asked for a color MP3 phone last time.

Naturally, carrying it around attracted a lot of curious people.

Of course, these people were not ordinary, and later they wanted to have the expensive PDA phone before anyone else, even if it cost a lot of money.

‘Just by this, you can tell Hyun-woo is truly outstanding.’

Kim Tae-hyun looked at his PDA phone with a complicated expression before making the call.

It felt like Lee Hyun-woo had encountered a formidable opponent too soon.

‘He must hold out well…’

* * *

The next day, upon hearing the news that reached 【Jungle】's secretariat, the expressions of the two managers hardened.

"Manager! 【Macro Soft】 has recommended that domestic PC manufacturers must pre-install Internet X Cross."

"In fact, it's more like a threat than a recommendation. They said if not, they would prioritize distributing Windows 97 to other places."

"We found out that it has already started in the U.S."

"Yes, so major computer manufacturers have internally decided to pre-install 'Internet X Cross' instead of 'Navigator'."

The staff in 【Jungle】's secretariat were all competent, resembling their managers.

Moreover, working at one of the world's leading portal sites made them more specialized in handling information.

Thus, they were able to collect domestic and international information in a short time and report it like this.

"Is this true?"

"Is the information accurate?"

"Yes, it is."

"Although we haven't entered the U.S. market, this move by 【Macro Soft】 in Korea would certainly affect us."

Currently, 【Jungle】's web browser Forest is doing very well in Korea.

Naturally, the current report could only be read as 【Macro Soft】's ambition.

"What should we do? The situation suddenly seems tense."

"Yes, should the CEO still meet Billy Kates?"

The eyes of the two managers wavered significantly over 【Macro Soft】's move, which was no different from a declaration of war.

Among them, Kang Dong-ho, with a more daring personality, spoke up.

"I'll report this to the CEO."

He volunteered to handle the bad news himself.

"Then I'll inform Director Woo."

"Let's do that. I'll see you shortly."

"Yes, Manager."

"Alright."

As the two managers moved in perfect sync, the secretariat quickly found their tasks and moved accordingly.

"Come on, let's contact each PC manufacturer to see if we can also pre-install our product."

"We should also contact the media."

"That's right. We need to highlight 【Macro Soft】's tyranny."

"But won't this make things awkward between us?"

"Well, the CEO will meet Billy Kates soon."

"That's not our concern. The CEO and the two managers will handle it. Let's focus on our tasks."

The staff of 【Jungle】's secretariat were moving on their own initiative.

Seeing this, Lee Hyun-woo might think of advancing his early retirement.

* * *

Meanwhile, in the CEO's office, upon hearing Kang Dong-ho's report, Lee Hyun-woo did not take 【Macro Soft】's forced installation of 'Internet X Cross' as negative news.

"I see. I expected this."

How could Lee Hyun-woo not know Billy Kates?

Although he had never met him, he knew about his actions very well.

Especially the well-known incident of forcing PC manufacturers worldwide to pre-install 'Internet X Cross'.

Billy Kates later even faced an antitrust lawsuit because of this.

‘Perhaps, this is why Tae-hyun hyung wanted to meet today.’

Lee Hyun-woo, with his sharp instincts, understood Kim Tae-hyun’s intentions.

On the other hand, Kang Dong-ho, puzzled by the CEO's unexpected reaction, asked,

"Then what should we do? Should we still meet Billy Kates..."

"Huh? We made an appointment, so of course, we should meet."

As expected, Lee Hyun-woo was unpredictable.

Despite 【Macro Soft】’s forced installation of the web browser being akin to a declaration of war, he still wanted to meet Billy Kates, the head of the company.

Having somewhat expected Lee Hyun-woo's reaction, Kang Dong-ho was not flustered and replied,

"Ah, yes, I thought so too, but I was worried it might make things very uncomfortable."

"It won’t. Don’t worry."

To Kang Dong-ho, Lee Hyun-woo always seemed composed.

He found many aspects of Lee Hyun-woo worth learning, and this was no exception.

Feeling reassured, a smile resembling Lee Hyun-woo's unconsciously formed on his face.

"Understood. I'll proceed as planned. But I’m really curious about one thing..."

“......”

"Every time something like this happens, you never seem flustered. Is it just an act in front of us, your natural demeanor, or as you said, because it’s within your expectations..."

Lee Hyun-woo's smile deepened.

It was a question showing Kang Dong-ho's character.

Unable to resist his curiosity, he would ask even the CEO.

Lee Hyun-woo liked that about him.

"Let's go with the last one."

"Wow, so you predicted all of this?"

"Yes."

And Lee Hyun-woo surprised Kang Dong-ho further with his answer.

"By the way, you should inform the secretariat managers that I am Nostradamus."

"Pardon?"

"Nostradamus. I feel a bit embarrassed saying it myself, but I’m a famous blogger and recently started writing columns. That’s my alternate persona."

Momentarily stunned, Kang Dong-ho’s eyes widened.

"N- Nostradamus is you, CEO?"

"Yes. So, incidents like this are well within my expectations. I’m good at foreseeing such things."

"Haha… I see..."

"Please call Manager Han in when you leave. He should know as well. Our secretariat managers need to be informed."

"Ah… Well… Understood. But Manager Han is currently informing Director Woo..."

"Then tell him to come to the CEO's office once he returns. It wouldn't be fair to inform one and not the other, as it might affect their coordination."

Later, Han Se-jin, twice as surprised as Kang Dong-ho, was forced to acknowledge Lee Hyun-woo's alternate persona.

Neither of them fully understood the term 'alternate persona', but that wasn’t important.

"Nostradamus was our CEO..."

"We have more to guard now."

"I expected it, but being a secretariat manager is no easy task."

"Yes, we need to keep our hearts steady."

"And our secrets."

They decided not to inform the secretariat staff.

The fewer people who know a secret, the better.

But they would not know.

Lee Hyun-woo planned to gradually reveal it, surprising the world when it eventually spread.

‘I haven’t committed any crime, after all.’

Sitting in the CEO's office with his hands clasped behind his head, Lee Hyun-woo smiled with his usual composure.

* * *

That afternoon, Kim Yoon-soo rushed to visit.

Naturally, he came to express his concern about 【Macro Soft】's forced installation of 'Internet X Cross'.

The person in question was completely at ease.

"Is that so?"

"Why are you so relaxed? Did you already know?"

"Yes, I was just informed."

"I see."

Somehow, even if he hadn’t been informed, he wouldn't seem surprised.

Knowing Lee Hyun-woo for a long time, such thoughts weren't unusual.

Believing that there must be a suitable countermeasure, Kim Yoon-soo asked,

"What will you do?"

"What can we do? They will devise their strategy, and we will respond diligently. An interesting battle lies ahead."

"So, you have a plan."

"Of course."

"Then it's fine. That's a relief."

He didn't even ask what the plan was.

This showed that he came purely out of concern.

Lee Hyun-woo, knowing this, deliberately made a guess.

"You've also changed for the better."

"Huh? What do you mean by that?"

"In the past, you would have declared not to pre-install ‘Internet X Cross’ out of loyalty to me, without considering the repercussions. But now, you check my situation while proceeding with your work. It seems the position and circumstances have turned you into a true businessman."

“......”

Kim Yoon-soo clamped his mouth shut.

In truth, he had intended to tell Lee Hyun-woo.

Even if everyone else pre-installs ‘Internet X Cross’, he would not.

To him, loyalty to Lee Hyun-woo was more important.

But receiving such praise from Lee Hyun-woo for being shaped into a true businessman by his position and circumstances left him speechless.

"Haha… Well… Anyway, that's a relief… Hahaha..."

Kim Yoon-soo would not know.

That Lee Hyun-woo had already discerned everything by looking at his expression upon entering the CEO's office.

‘Don’t get involved in this fight. You’ll only get hurt.’

As time passes, it will be a favorable battle for 【Jungle】.

There was no need for the small shrimp 【One Computer】 to oppose the whale 【Macro Soft】.
