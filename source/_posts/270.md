The sound of the camera shutter somehow makes people tense.

Of course, it wasn't like this from the beginning. How many photos had I taken while preparing to become a National Assembly member in my past life?

It was a life stained with greed and power. To enter politics, I often had to put on a fake smile in front of others. When I visited traditional markets and ate a 6,000 won bowl of gukbap to comfort the market merchants, there were always photographers following me.

"Candidate No. 1, Kang Hyun, bringing fresh clean water to stagnant water―!"

When the prepared person shouted the slogan, the traditional market was soon filled with chants calling my name.

People who didn't know me would occasionally peek out and look at my face. At such moments, I would smile warmly and clasp hands with the market merchants who had worked hard all their lives.

When I left the market and got in the car, the aide would immediately hand me a wet tissue.

Damn.

Just like my father-in-law, who was a three-term lawmaker at the time, I was used to wearing a mask. But just as the used wet tissue was thrown out the car window, my life was also discarded like that.

There was no sign of regret on the faces of my father-in-law and my wife. For them, abandoning me was no different from abandoning a sick pet.

Was that why?

- I established the Kang Yoo Foundation for the underprivileged neighbors and young people who can't blossom their talents. My small wish is that many people would be happy because of my small steps, just as much as the love I received from the people.

I did not take lightly the chance that the gods had given me once more. It had been a long time since I discarded the life that chased greed and power.

Though I could not become a missionary who throws himself into the flames, I vowed to live a life without regrets.

I erased the stained shadows of my past life that chased success and helped others with my talents.

Then, like a lie, success and happiness naturally followed. As if this was fate.

"Dear, I'm pregnant―!"

I still can't forget that moment. The movement of the small life growing inside the woman I loved.

Yooha looked up at me with trembling eyes. I was grateful to her. She was the one who changed my life.

The grandfathers carefully picked up a small photo as if it were a sacred relic. They looked at the face of the baby in the ultrasound photo, saying who they resembled, and showing a happy smile like children, saying the lips were so cute.

My parents embraced me, now an adult, and gifted me the baby clothes I wore as a child. I was curious about how they had kept it until now.

But now that I had a child, I understood. How my parents must have felt looking at me.

- The train bound for Jeongdongjin is now arriving at the station.

Fortunately, Yooha, who was pregnant, did not suffer from severe morning sickness and found it a little easier to be active.

She wanted to spend the time she couldn't with me. It was a train trip that any ordinary couple would try at least once.

With the sound of the horn, the train bound for Jeongdongjin was entering the station. Looking at the approaching train, Yooha grasped my hand with all her might. Her heartbeat and the baby's movement inside her flowed through my fingertips.

I thought as I patted her head with a happy smile. How many life's histories had I gone through to come to this place, just like the train running towards the final destination?

"Darling, I'm here."

I visited the ancestral grave with my grandfather. The clean gravestones and the grass-free grave under the shining sunlight gave off a warmer feeling than ever before.

Yellow daylilies and sunny flowers, grown under the summer sun, always welcomed my grandfather.

Grandfather carefully stroked the grave with his wrinkled hand.

"I was a bit late because I made your favorite pumpkin pancakes. You must have waited long, right?"

Grandfather carefully placed the pumpkin pancakes he made from early morning on the table in front of the grave, along with a glass of white milk that grandmother liked when she was alive.

Grandfather silently looked at the grave for a while. There were waves of memories in his wrinkled eyes, as if reminiscing about the past days.

"Darling, our Kang is taking good care of Dongju Chemical, which was named after the middle letter of my name and the last letter of your name. These days, Dongju Chemical has become so famous that you must be watching it well from heaven. But I feel uneasy in my heart because I couldn't do much for you when we were young. I wonder if I'm enjoying this great happiness alone."

The reason grandfather cherished Dongju so much was simple. To him, Dongju was one of the few relics left by grandmother.

The pine wind was blowing through the pine trees in the ancestral graveyard. The sound of the creek flowing and the chirping of birds were creating a peaceful resting place for grandmother, more melodious than any instrument.

"Darling, you're watching Hyun from heaven, right? Our grandson is doing so well that he said he would get married now."

Grandfather stroked the grave affectionately, as if having a conversation with grandmother.

"Hyun, you're establishing the Kang Yoo Foundation this time?"

"Yes, grandfather."

"It's named after your and Yooha's names. Darling, look at this. Our grandson resembles us so much. If you were alive, you would have patted his back, saying he did well."

Hearing grandfather's voice, Kang Hyun felt tears welling up unknowingly.

The back of the grandfather, who always seemed like a giant, now clearly showed how much responsibility and weight he had been carrying as a husband all this time.

"Hyun, my wish is for my grandson to live happily. Darling, you think the same, right?"

When Kang Hyun shed tears, grandfather, surprised, handed him a handkerchief.

The grandson, who had always been too mature for his age, was now shedding tears like a child, and grandfather patted his head warmly.

Kang Hyun felt a wave of emotions he had never felt in his past life. Grandfather looked up at the blue sky and asked,

"Hasn't our grandson grown up so well?"

At that moment, a blue butterfly flew around the grave as if in response.

[A wedding of the century is being held in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. The protagonists are violinist and maestro Kang Hyun and Son Yooha, the granddaughter of Daeil Group's Chairman Son Jangwon. To celebrate the couple's wedding, not only domestic political and business figures but also classical music giants from abroad are arriving in South Korea one after another. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea is also busy with the arrival of famous giants from around the world, including Tannenbaum, the chairman of the Barbara Group, a super-large corporation known overseas, who is flying to South Korea on a private jet.]

The anchor's voice was filled with excitement. Incheon Airport was crowded with numerous reporters and more security personnel than ever seen before.

The South Korean government was also in turmoil. As the name "wedding of the century" suggested, not only was it reported by foreign media, but giants from various countries were gathering as if they had made a pact.

[Gustav, the eternal maestro, and Empress Karas have just arrived together. Following them, the chief conductor of the London Symphony, Spencer, and the lion of Berlin, Yuri, who leads the Berlin Philharmonic, are also here. It's truly an extraordinary scene. It's rare to see the faces of violinist masters in the classical music world, but here they are, smiling as they set foot on South Korean soil, including the Japanese master Hirose and many other masters from various countries.]

It was almost unprecedented for so many masters of the classical music world to gather in one place. Most of them had their schedules packed for the entire year.

In the past, they would gather for virtuoso performances or maestro conductings at Carnegie Hall, but never to this extent. Surely, today would be remembered for a long time.

The anchor added, watching the scene that would mark classical music history.

[The eternal crown prince of the United Kingdom, Samuel Gardner, has also announced his visit to South Korea for the wedding of Kang Hyun and Son Yooha. Many couples have weddings, but never before has the world been so excited about a day like today. Daeil Group has also announced that they will continue to hold donation and charity events for the next five years. The public is also welcoming the wedding of Kang Hyun and Son Yooha as if it were a national festival.]

Kang Hyun was already a prominent figure in promoting South Korea to the world. When the love story of Kang Hyun and Son Yooha, which started from childhood, was revealed, many people cheered.

Moreover, with the disclosure of their hidden donation history, the public's interest in the couple grew even more.

Was it thanks to Kang Hyun's past contributions to national prestige? The public's happiness and congratulations towards the couple were as enthusiastic as the 2002 World Cup.

[Barbara Group's chairman Barbara Tannenbaum has just arrived. It's really amazing. Even the president of the United States finds it hard to meet Barbara Tannenbaum, but he has come to South Korea with minimal security. His schedule is said to be only for the wedding of Kang Hyun and Son Yooha.]

The anchor seemed overwhelmed. Watching the screen showing Incheon Airport live, the famous figures being named were a parade of global giants rarely seen together. People one might see in Time magazine, all flocking to South Korea.

They all expressed their congratulations to Kang Hyun and Son Yooha to the reporters, showing off their acquaintance with the couple.

Finally, with the appearance of the eternal crown prince of the United Kingdom, Samuel Gardner, the anchor spoke in a dazed manner.

Cicada cicada buzz buzz―!

With the brilliant sunshine of a summer day,

"I'm Kim Daewoo, a friend of the groom, Kang Hyun, and I will be hosting today's ceremony. First, I would like to thank all the guests who have come a long way to celebrate the wedding of Kang Hyun and Son Yooha. Many famous people from around the world have come, and even as the host, I can't hide my trembling emotions. It means the audience is shining that much. Please give a warm round of applause and enthusiastic cheers as the bride and groom make their entrance."

The wedding ceremony began. Kim Daewoo, a friend, brightened up the event as the host. Although he might have been nervous, contrary to his words, the bear-like man showed a stable demeanor as a host, befitting his large build.

For the congratulatory performance, pianist Baek Junghoon played, and he was so emotional looking at me that anyone who didn't know might think we were blood brothers.

It was no exaggeration to say it was the greatest day of my life. Who wouldn't be nervous on their wedding day?

When I appeared in a tuxedo, enthusiastic cheers erupted.

Even the expressions of the numerous masters were filled with emotion. Their faces were full of pleasant smiles, as if sending off a grown-up son to be married.

Anna and friends, with whom I spent my days at the chapel, also came to celebrate my wedding. I was so grateful to them.

Of course, the people I was most grateful for were my parents.

'Mother, Father.'

Tears of emotion that couldn't be hidden streamed down the faces of my parents, who were seated in the VIP seats of both families.

The grandfathers were no different. Although they usually showed stern and absolute charisma in the company, they were now wiping away tears with handkerchiefs, celebrating the future of their grandchildren.

My younger brother, Haneul, was smiling brightly as if blessing the day, not crying despite the many people present, just like his nickname "Happiness."

"Now, the goddess of today's wedding and the lifelong love and strong partner of the groom Kang Hyun, the bride, will make her entrance―!"

Wearing a pure white dress, Yooha walked towards me, holding her father's hand.

Although there were hot cheers and shouts, I could only see Yooha.

The halo was so dazzling that I almost imagined wings on her back.

Father-in-law handed Yooha's hand to me with a silent look.

Please take good care of our daughter.

Don't worry, father-in-law.

The overwhelming emotion was incomparable to any concert hall stage.

Holding hands with Yooha and exchanging glances, until we kissed, she was no longer the Ice Queen. She had become my queen, with whom I would walk the path of life together.

"Now that we've seen the kiss of the century, it's time to test the groom's strength! Let's see the groom carry his queen as much as he loves her!"

The guests burst into laughter at the playful comment from the host, Kim Daewoo. It seemed that the parents and grandfathers, who were shedding tears, also liked Kim Daewoo's hosting.

"Now, let's see how much the bride and groom are grateful to their parents and families! Bride and groom, please give your parents and grandfathers a big hug!"

We gave big hugs to our parents and grandfathers.

The wedding was filled with happy laughter. The masters and famous figures from around the world also seemed to like the wedding atmosphere, as they didn't spare their applause.

"Now, let's take a photo. Everyone, please come out!"

Compared to ordinary wedding halls, the venue was vast, reflecting the many guests who attended the wedding. But it matched the scale of the wedding, which was worthy of its "wedding of the century" reputation. The faces of the guests reminded me of my life's journey.

"Groom, show your love for the bride with all your might!"

Yooha, in her pure white dress, looked up at me with an excited smile.

Should I hesitate? I embraced her and kissed her. Cheers erupted along with the warm touch.

The happy laughter of parents and grandfathers, Yooha's heartbeat, resonated more beautifully than any melody through my whole body.

With the kiss of the bride and groom, the photographer smiled with satisfaction.

Under the brilliant sunlight, receiving her gaze, I thought. From now on, the one and only audience in my life would be Son Yooha, her.
