“I'm bored.”

Son Yooha was wandering around the mansion alone, unable to join in on the adults' conversation. This made the secretary in charge of her sweat profusely and fidget nervously.

Grandfather and Father were deeply engrossed in conversation with a foreign gentleman. What could be so delightful?

“I’m bored!”

Meanwhile, Chairman Wang had a broad smile on his face, as Samuel Gardner had expressed his intention to cooperate actively.

Gardner had initially visited Korea as part of a business trip. Unlike his royal status, his down-to-earth personality was strikingly different from his brother's.

“Eternal Crown Prince. I don’t like this title. The original succession to the throne was my brother’s. I would appreciate it if you would call me Samuel as before.”

Samuel Gardner had not originally possessed succession rights to the throne. The initial crown prince had been dethroned due to numerous scandals and incidents in his youth, earning the public's resentment. This led to Samuel taking the position, unexpectedly gaining massive public support and acclaim.

At that moment, Chairman Wang put down his teacup and spoke fluent English.

“Samuel, thanks to you, our hotel has been reborn as an international business hotel.”

“No, what have I done? I merely served as a figurehead. It’s all because of Daeil Group’s reputation.”

The development speed of the department store and hotel industries was dazzling, to say the least. The companies' marketing efforts were so intense that they did not hesitate to use famous celebrities and even political figures for advertising.

Of course, Daeil Group had brought in a significant figure to match its reputation.

“No, the newspapers are continuously covering Samuel’s visit to Korea. I am so happy that the hotels and department stores serving as the backdrop are ours. Can you believe this old heart is beating strongly again?”

The additional effect of Samuel merely staying and showing familiarity was enormous. This wasn’t something money could buy.

Naturally, all this had been orchestrated and planned by Son Ilsung. He glanced at his smiling father and swallowed his joy internally.

“By the way, Mr. Son. If it’s not too much trouble, could I ask for a favor?”

At that moment, Samuel looked intently at Son Ilsung.

A favor?

He was willing to accept any request he made. The value his father recognized in him was immeasurable in monetary terms.

“Could you get a video of that young gentleman playing the violin at the banquet? It seemed like it was being filmed at the time.”

It was an unexpected request.

Though it was a private gathering, they had filmed the performance for his daughter's sake. Of course, they had also recorded Kang Hyun's performance.

“Samuel, may I ask what you plan to do with it?”

“I have an old friend who is into classical music. I thought of showing him the young gentleman's violin performance. A copy would suffice.”

Samuel Gardner, born into royalty, could not escape classical music in European social circles. Even Son Ilsung could not fathom how many great masters he knew.

Son Ilsung glanced at his father. Chairman Wang looked into Samuel’s eyes for a long time before nodding briefly.

“Wasn't it uncomfortable traveling such a long way?”

Grandfather tried to erase his awkwardness as he spoke to Mother. It had been years since their last reunion. However, warm affection flowed at the dinner table instead of awkwardness, as evidenced by the redness in their eyes.

“Thanks to the car you sent, I came comfortably.”

Grandfather nodded silently while eating. There were mountains of things he wanted to ask right away, but just looking at Mother seemed to fill him with long-held sorrow.

The youngest daughter he had always cherished. How many years had passed? Like his wrinkled eyes, wrinkles had also appeared at the corners of his youngest daughter's eyes.

After dinner,

The housekeeper brought out coffee, orange juice, and sujeonggwa with pine nuts floating on a tray. Mother took the sujeonggwa and gazed at the housekeeper with a touched expression.

“Madam, you still remembered this?”

“How could I forget what our young lady liked?”

The housekeeper had worked in Grandfather's house for a long time. Having seen Mother's childhood, she knew her tastes well and remembered that she was the only one who enjoyed sujeonggwa in the house. The housekeeper's face showed deep emotions.

At that moment, Grandfather slowly began to speak to Mother.

“What is Kang doing, why didn’t he come with you?”

“What?”

Mother exclaimed, almost dropping her teacup in surprise. She was visibly startled.

Grandfather had never acknowledged her husband as his son-in-law throughout his life. He had even severed ties with his child, so it was unimaginable how deep his resentment must have been. But then,

“Next time, come with him.”

Mother nodded without a word, looking as if she was about to burst into tears. Grandfather's hardened heart seemed to crack at the sight of his youngest daughter, whom he had longed to see so much.

Why had he kept the daughter he missed so dearly at such a distance? There were many things he wanted to say, but the words did not come out.

At that moment, Grandfather's gaze fell on Kang Hyun.

“You have raised a fine son.”

There is a saying that you can tell the character of the parents by looking at their child. In that sense, his grandson Kang Hyun had grown up to be much more upright than he had imagined. Much more so than his greedy and immature uncles.

Mother was wiping away tears, her shoulders shaking. I held her hand in mine.

“I missed you.”

Grandfather, looking into Mother's tear-filled eyes, finally said what he had been unable to say all this time.

“My daughter.”

* * *

Squeak squeak, rustle rustle-!

“Father, we’re here.”

Early in the morning, Kang Hyun's aunt, Mrs. Yubokja, visited the mansion in Ichon-dong.

She was carrying a bundle of packages, and her husband entered with an awkward expression. He was a doctor who had opened his practice with Grandfather’s help, but his skills were not impressive, making him an empty shell.

“Oh my, the eldest young lady is here?”

The housekeeper, who had been doing housework, rushed out upon seeing the unexpected visitor.

Previously, she had appeared with her son, and now she had even brought her husband. It was understandable; she must have felt desperate.

“Auntie, please take this.”

Seizing the opportunity, the aunt handed over the packages to the housekeeper, all the while looking around the mansion.

“What is all this, eldest young lady?”

“I prepared Father’s favorite foods. Make sure to bring them out during the meal later.”

Did she make all this food herself? Nonsense, she was someone who had never lifted a finger in the kitchen.

At that moment, the aunt’s eyes widened as she entered the living room.

“You?”

She raised her voice as if she had seen a ghost. Grandfather, Mother, and I were sitting on the living room sofa.

They say blood is thicker than water? That saying doesn’t apply to Mother's siblings. After Grandfather passed away, her brothers and sister openly contested her over the inheritance.

Following closely,

“Father, we’re here.”

The eldest uncle and his wife, followed by the second uncle and his wife, entered the mansion. They looked puzzled at the sight of the aunt standing still, then gasped upon seeing Mother sitting on the sofa.

Oh, this is exasperating. If they had any familial affection, they wouldn’t have ignored their youngest sister for so many years.

I glanced at Grandfather. He kept his eyes closed and spoke sparingly.

As expected.

‘Grandfather called them all here.’

They wouldn’t visit Ichon-dong early in the morning otherwise.

“Hyunja, how did you get here?”

The second uncle asked, glaring at me. He was even more hostile than when he first saw me.

The second uncle had been losing his standing in the family. Unlike himself, who wasn’t even allowed to attend golf meetings, his nephew had already attended gatherings with future conglomerate heirs. It would be a lie to say he wasn’t anxious.

Just then,

“Everyone, take a seat.”

Grandfather half-opened his eyes and raised his voice, causing everyone to fall silent.

“Beomkyung.”

At Grandfather's call, the second uncle straightened his back. His wife also swallowed nervously, looking tense. They appeared as serious as soldiers receiving a life-or-death mission.

“It’s good to increase your subordinates in the company.”

Unable to perform well, the second uncle filled his team with people who catered to him, regardless of their work capabilities.

“But you’re raising petty thieves!”

“F-Father, what do you mean by that?”

The second uncle, not understanding, asked back. Grandfather’s eyes gleamed. His gaze made me realize the saying "killing someone with a look" wasn’t just a figure of speech.

“You fool!”

At Grandfather’s outburst, the second uncle’s pupils trembled like an earthquake. He was probably already thinking of who the culprit was. Clearly, he was a simpleton who couldn’t even manage his subordinates properly.

The eldest uncle and the aunt were nervously licking their dry lips, fearing they might also be scolded.

“The reason I called you all here today is for the future of Dongju.”

At the mention of Dongju, the uncles and aunt's eyes changed.

What was Dongju? The company Grandfather had built his entire life, his masterpiece.

One by one, their faces, which had been tense, flashed with greed.

Oh, if only they had guarded the company as fiercely as their material desires. In my previous life, I felt more bitterness than satisfaction watching Dongju get divided by foreign capital.

“From now on, Hyunja will also participate in Dongju’s future.”

At Grandfather’s sudden announcement, the eldest uncle stood up abruptly. The second uncle and the aunt also looked flustered. Mother, too, couldn’t hide her surprise at hearing this for the first time.

“Father, it’s absurd for Hyunja to participate in business management after showing up out of the blue after so many years. How much could she know about management, having run just a laundromat? I understand your feelings of seeing Hyunja after such a long time, but you need to reconsider this.”

Grandfather stared intently at the eldest uncle. The eldest uncle, who had stood up, swallowed nervously and sat back down.

“Isn’t the Hyunseong Group chaired by a widow? After her husband passed, she became a housewife and now runs a big company. Look at Jeil; in business management, ability comes before gender.”

Despite Grandfather’s words, the eldest uncle still looked dissatisfied. As the eldest, he had seized countless opportunities, but had continuously disappointed Grandfather.

Grandfather’s eyes suddenly turned sharp. This was clearly different from my previous life.

“I wonder if you truly understand business management.”

Grandfather’s demeanor had changed.
