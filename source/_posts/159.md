“CEO, if it’s something Kang Hyun wants, we’ll do anything for him.”

The voice was filled with earnestness. The Chairman of the Arts Center’s face was as earnest as his voice.

The reason he had come to Im Hyera so early in the morning was simple.

“Could we hold Kang Hyun’s solo recital at our Arts Center?”

He wanted to host Kang Hyun’s second solo recital at the Arts Center. On the other hand, Im Hyera couldn’t easily give a definite answer.

“CEO, do you think our Arts Center is lacking?”

“That’s not it, Chairman.”

Of course, the Arts Center had undergone countless improvements and renovations to fix the resonance issues that once earned it the nickname “the bathhouse of arts.”

Moreover, it was equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, including the installation of a pipe organ and climate control sensitive to temperature and humidity for the instruments.

The auditorium was also a large-scale venue with over 2,000 seats, making it one of the best concert halls anywhere.

“All the staff at the Arts Center will do their best for Kang Hyun. Not only have we fixed the issues with residual echoes in the concert hall, but we’ve also reinforced the design so that Kang Hyun’s performance can be heard clearly even on the remote third floor. To exaggerate a bit, we can proudly say it’s comparable to Carnegie Hall.”

Im Hyera was well aware of why the Chairman of the Arts Center was so enthusiastic.

He was a well-known ardent fan of Kang Hyun. The reason he, who had been ignorant of classical music, developed such a deep interest in music was due to Kang Hyun’s past performances.

After the encore performance of the London Symphony, he had been like a lovesick person, constantly contacting the gallery to ask if there were any updates on Kang Hyun’s solo recitals.

“Chairman, we understand your feelings very well. But it’s difficult to give a definitive answer at this moment. The repertoire for the solo recital is still in its early stages, and Hyun hasn’t decided how he will proceed with the performance. And to be honest.”

“Could it be that other places have contacted you?”

Im Hyera nodded silently. As soon as the news of Kang Hyun’s second solo recital leaked, concert halls from around the world had been contacting them incessantly.

From Boston Symphony Hall, London’s Royal Albert Hall, and even Carnegie Hall, almost all of the world’s top concert halls had reached out.

At first, it seemed too good to be true. It was just a solo recital, not an orchestra concert.

But after hearing them out, they all expressed a strong desire to host Kang Hyun’s solo recital.

It was an unprecedented level of interest for an Asian violinist.

“Is it true that so many have contacted you just for his second solo recital, not an orchestra concert?”

“Yes, Chairman.”

“Huh!”

The Chairman of the Arts Center’s eyes showed a hint of bewilderment.

Compared to concert halls that have made their mark in classical music history, the Arts Center, which was built just over ten years ago, was different in historical value and starting point. It was like the battle between David and Goliath.

The Chairman of the Arts Center had often said that his wish before his term ended was to hear Kang Hyun’s solo recital. But now, that wish seemed to be slipping away, leaving him feeling sad.

“Chairman, we don’t necessarily prefer large, historically significant concert halls. The most important things are the performer’s condition and the space that matches the repertoire. And decisively.”

Im Hyera added, reading the concern in the Chairman’s eyes.

“The final choice is Hyun’s.”

“Oppaaa—!”

Son Yooha had been visiting the studio for several days. She always came with hands full of food and eyes curved like crescent moons.

The aloof cat-like demeanor from their first reunion was gone, and now she was like a gentle Labrador Retriever.

“Oppa, try this.”

“Japchae?”

“Yes, I made it!”

Her cooking skills were surprisingly exceptional. Not only japchae but also many other side dishes were handmade, making it seem like she was taking bridal lessons.

In just a few days of meeting Yooha, Hyun had gained 2 kilograms, understanding why people say meeting a queen of domestic affairs makes your waistline expand.

It was a sense of fullness he had never felt in his past life.

“Oppa, I heard from Mihyun unnie that a lot of fan letters have come to the gallery. Is that true?”

“Huh?”

“Not just fan letters, but girls even come looking for you in person?”

Son Yooha’s gaze was so intense that he almost choked on the japchae.

Indeed, after the Royal Performance in England, the number of fan letters had significantly increased. They came from Korea and around the world. Some fans even came to the gallery to see him.

It was no wonder that Mihyun noona’s joke about starting a fan club was becoming a reality, giving him a headache.

“Oppa, graduation is coming up soon. Have you decided which university to go to?”

“University, huh.”

“Actually, I want to go to the same school as you. Michelle said that being a campus couple in college is really great!”

It seemed she enjoyed watching American teen dramas. She was already talking about being a campus couple.

Son Yooha was talented enough to get into any Ivy League school.

The same went for me, but I wasn’t particularly interested in any of them. Spending four years studying at a university instead of a music academy didn’t appeal to me.

“I haven’t really thought about it yet. Grandfather seems to want me to get into a prestigious university, though.”

“Really?”

Son Yooha couldn’t hide her disappointment. Knowing how difficult it is to study alone in a foreign country, I understood her feelings.

“Yooha, should I play a piece for you?”

“A piece?”

“Yes, you used to ask me to play the violin every time we met.”

I suggested it as a way to change her mood. Understanding my intent, Yooha smiled brightly.

I took Yooha’s hand and led her to the gallery’s rooftop.

As dusk fell and moonlight seeped in, the gallery’s rooftop transformed into a picturesque scene.

Moreover, it had been a while since I picked up ‘Fantasy,’ which was clamoring to be played.

Zing.

The glissando slid smoothly, like stars swimming beneath a vast lake. ‘Fantasy’ boasted a serene melody as if it were a mermaid’s song.

I relaxed my right hand, which held the bow, and gently caressed the strings, creating ripples like those on a lake. The tremolo trembled like Yooha’s heartbeat.

Zing.

It was a piece that spoke of endless peace and love, without any special techniques or flashy high notes.

The melody was as comfortable as reading a lyrical poem, and the arpeggios that handled the final note did not give a dizzying sensation but rather offered mystery and dreaminess.

Though it was an unnamed, untitled piece, at that moment, it was enough to make Son Yooha’s heart flutter more than any famous masterpiece.

As the bow slowly, very slowly, descended toward the ground.

Smooch.

Son Yooha stood on her tiptoes and gave a kiss as payment for the performance. At that moment, the stars shined, and the full moon poured down.

“A solo violin recital by Hyun?”

The white-haired violinist Hirose raised her voice. It was unexpected news.

“Yes, Sensei. Although the exact schedule hasn’t been set, it’s true that he is planning his second solo violin recital.”

Manager Goro’s words made Hirose’s eyes widen. It was the solo recital by Hyun that she had been waiting for years.

When he showed his skills as a conductor at the Royal Performance in England, it was not just surprising but astonishing.

His musical talent was not limited to the violin. He had an impressive debut as a young maestro, without feeling embarrassed by the nickname.

“He conducted so brilliantly that I thought he wouldn’t play the violin for a while, but I was wrong.”

Hirose’s lips curved into a smile. She had shown immense interest in Kang Hyun ever since she first met him.

“Goro, I think we should go to Korea right away.”

“To Korea?”

“I want to play the violin with Hyun. Performing a Bach piece in a concert hall would be wonderful. Two violins competing and presenting a splendid musical idea. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. But to make a request, I need to talk to him in person, don’t I?”

Manager Hasegawa Goro’s face showed a hint of confusion.

The reason was simple. Hirose was a revered maestro in Japan.

She had never personally asked anyone to perform with her. Quite the opposite, in fact.

“Sensei, with all due respect, is it necessary for you to ask Hyun personally? How about I contact him instead?”

“Goro, I appreciate your concern, but I don’t have much time left to play the violin. My shoulders and fingers aren’t what they used to be. My doctor also said that the time I have to play the violin is now shorter than the time I can’t. It’s rather fortunate. Meeting him while I can still produce the melodies of old, and.”

Her white hair swayed as if expressing her emotions.

“Being able to spend such golden moments at the end of my life.”

Like the nickname “Queen of the Strings,” she moved to give Hyun a final gift.

* * *

Achoo—!

Kang Hyun rubbed his nose with his long fingers. Even though he had pulled the blanket up to his face, he still felt chills all over his body.

Somehow, he had caught a summer cold, which even dogs don’t catch. It seemed that performing on the rooftop recently had taken a toll.

The school was in an uproar since the morning. From his homeroom teacher to the principal, everyone had been calling to check on Kang Hyun’s health.

Of course, with the College Scholastic Ability Test just a few months away, it was natural that Jeil High School’s top student not attending school would cause concern.

“There are so many things to worry about.”

After the College Scholastic Ability Test, he also had to plan his solo recital.

Kang Hyun had heard many things from Im Hyera. Not only the Arts Center but also concert halls worldwide had requested to host his solo recital.

Although the choice was his, Kang Hyun felt a strange attraction to the Arts Center over any of the world-renowned concert halls.

He was trying to shake off his thoughts and go back to sleep when he heard a knock.

Knock, knock.

A familiar girl appeared beyond the door.

Surprised by Son Yooha’s sudden visit, Kang Hyun sat up from his bed.

“Oppa, are you okay?”

Anyone would think he had an incurable disease. Son Yooha, with teary eyes, approached Kang Hyun and supported his waist.

Meanwhile, Son Yooha’s gaze at Kang Hyun, who was sitting on the bed, was quite serious.

“Here, eat this. When you have a severe cold, you lose your appetite. I made some savory perilla seed porridge for you.”

“You know how to make perilla seed porridge?”

“Of course, I memorized the recipe just in case something like this happened.”

Although porridge isn’t difficult to make, its taste can vary greatly depending on the cook.

Kang Hyun’s eyes widened as he took a bite of the perilla seed porridge Yooha made.

Thinking that if she weren’t the heir of a conglomerate, she might have become a culinary mogul, Kang Hyun couldn’t help but eat spoonful after spoonful.

How could anyone believe that this savory and mature-tasting porridge was made by a young girl?

“Eat slowly.”

“It’s so delicious that I can’t help eating it quickly. Yooha, I think you have a talent for cooking.”

Whether it was because of the compliment or because Kang Hyun patted her head, Son Yooha’s face turned as red as a well-ripened persimmon.

After finishing the porridge, Kang Hyun got up and took a sheet music book from the shelf. It was a collection of special pieces he had created.

“Oppa, what’s this?”

“These are pieces I composed whenever I thought of you.”

Son Yooha’s face showed signs of being deeply moved. The fact that there were so many pieces composed while thinking of her indicated that Kang Hyun always had her in mind.

Though the pieces had no titles, each note on the sheet music felt like a love letter, making Son Yooha’s heart flutter.

How much time had passed?

Knock, knock.

The knocking sound echoed in Kang Hyun’s room again. His mother, Kang Hyunja, carefully opened the door and looked inside.

She had come to check since there was no sign of activity. After taking a quick look around the room, Kang Hyunja smiled softly.

“Oh, how lovely.”

Her son Kang Hyun was lying down, and next to him, Son Yooha was asleep, leaning against him with their faces close together. She was holding onto the sheet music book tightly.
