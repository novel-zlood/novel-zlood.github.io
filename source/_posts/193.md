"Spencer, why do you look so down?"

It was a visit from the eternal crown prince, Samuel.

Spencer, sitting in the command room, looked utterly bored, as if he had transcended all worldly matters.

"It's because I have to leave London soon."

"Even though my shoulder isn't in great shape, I thought I could still go on for a few more years."

"If I step down early, the next conductor will be able to adapt more comfortably. The same goes for the members."

Spencer had someone in mind for the next conductor. But the problem was, that person didn't seem interested in joining the London Symphony.

"Is it because of Hyun that you look so down?"

Indeed, as time went on, more and more maestros were sending love calls to Hyun.

Ultimately, even the eternal maestro and the legendary empress, Karas, sent love calls.

By now, he must be learning conducting from Karas at the grand mansion in Austria.

"To see the mighty Spencer so troubled over one person, it's truly surprising. Hyun is in Austria now, right?"

"Yes, he's probably learning conducting from the empress. I want to bring him to London right away, but the fact that the empress herself is teaching him is unprecedented."

"The queen of conducting, is it such a big deal to learn from Maestro Karas?"

Spencer looked at Samuel as if asking why he was stating the obvious.

But eventually, he understood. For an ordinary person who hasn't lived as a conductor, it would be hard to grasp the empress's immense fame.

"If the empress were to offer me lessons in conducting, I'd leave for Austria tomorrow."

"Really, it's that significant?"

"It's not just me. Even the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic would feel the same. Any conductor's heart would race at the name of the empress. That's why conductors are in such an uproar. Not only did the empress, who had been hidden in Austria, reappear, but she also took on her first student."

Being the first student of a living legend.

Though it wasn't a perfect mentor-student relationship, the fact that the empress Karas taught conducting held great significance.

The music world even said that Hyun, who had just become an adult, was not only the reincarnation of Mozart but also the beloved of the 'god of music.'

"He might surpass me at this rate."

Spencer smiled faintly, thinking of Kang Hyun.

* * *

Just as a baby can't run before learning to walk, he was relearning from the basics. He started from the ground up, like laying the foundation of a building.

He practiced the posture of holding the baton, breathing, and eye movements first.

"Understanding conducting is extremely difficult. I've lived my whole life as a conductor, yet I still can't confidently say I fully understand the mysterious world of conducting. Hyun, your right fingertip is slightly down."

Wasn't this Spartan training? He had been repeating the same movements for hours.

If his posture faltered even a bit, the maestro would notice it like a ghost. It felt as if she could read his breathing.

It was to the point where he felt like his body wasn't his own.

"When I first learned conducting, my teacher told me I wasn't qualified to be a conductor. I couldn't even play the harmonic instrument piano, nor did I understand the interaction between instruments. So, my teacher taught me conducting harshly from the start."

It was the first time hearing that story. Who in the world would dare say that the empress Karas, known as an unparalleled genius, had no talent in conducting?

Saying she had no talent was an insult to other conductors. But when would this training end? He had been repeating basic movements for days. He even practiced in his dreams.

"In that sense, Hyun, you have great potential. Just looking at this basic training shows it."

"Even though I've been focusing on posture for about a week?"

"That's excellent. It took me over three months when I first learned conducting from my teacher."

He was speechless. Who was Karas's teacher to push her so harshly?

"Understanding and learning music is incredibly difficult. Especially conducting, which involves bringing together numerous instruments to perform. You have to understand their diverse characteristics and even the personalities of the members. I remember trembling like an aspen tree during my debut performance."

"Did you, Maestro, get nervous?"

"Really. Musicians dream of a grand debut, just like any other artists. If you don't make a name for yourself early, you might get left behind. But I wasn't like that. I wanted a modest debut."

The maestro's wrinkled eyes seemed to reflect on the past.

"But that wish took a different turn due to my teacher's recommendation. I was to debut as a guest conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. It was possible because the chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic was a close friend of my teacher."

"May I ask how old you were then?"

"I was seventeen."

It was so astonishing that he couldn't help but laugh. At not even twenty, she conducted the world's top Philharmonic.

The past was even more conservative than now, not an era of flexibility.

The Berlin Philharmonic's members were famously proud, known worldwide in the classical music scene.

"Are you that surprised, Hyun? In a way, you had a similar debut at my age, didn't you? In both Berlin and London. And unlike me, you even performed at Buckingham Palace in your teens."

The maestro seemed genuinely surprised at his reaction. She wasn't wrong. Objectively, his achievements were indeed remarkable.

In middle school, he won the Queen Elisabeth Competition, and in high school, he even conducted a performance at the British Royal Palace.

Then,

"Hyun, by now your body must be warmed up?"

It looks like today's training won't be easy either.

* * *

The term "exhausted" would be fitting. In Korean, it's "nokcho," and in European, perhaps "pickle."

After all, except for meal times, he was continually receiving lessons.

This was the first time since his past life that he studied something so intensely.

'Let's call it a day.'

As soon as those words left the maestro's mouth, his whole body relaxed.

It was a tension he hadn't even felt while preparing for the bar exam. But his heart felt much more at ease and enjoyable than back then.

His calluses had become even thicker. Initially formed from practicing the violin, they now far surpassed that level.

Even the relatively softer sides of his fingers and his wrists seemed to have developed more muscle, but who cared?

Now, he moved on to understanding harmony and the characteristics of instruments.

Already know it all?

Not quite, the maestro's profound knowledge made him realize that what he knew was just scratching the surface.

Even a small change in the composition and arrangement of instruments in the same symphony could make a significant difference in sound.

The maestro's mind seemed like a vast concert hall, capable of conjuring numerous instruments at will in an imaginary concert hall.

"The world is vast, and there truly are geniuses among geniuses."

Just then,

"Oppa!"

Son Yooha came to his room. She often visited briefly like this since she couldn't meet him during lessons with the maestro. It seemed she had made a simple sandwich as a late-night snack while waiting.

"I'm learning cooking from Mr. Mikkel these days. Try it!"

Hmm, it's quite a masterpiece. One bite and it tasted so flavorful that it felt more like a dish than a simple sandwich.

Of course, the maestro's chef was said to be a top chef even in Austria, so this was no surprise. But,

"You haven't visited recently."

It had been almost a month. Fortunately, the crying that echoed through the mansion in the early dawn had stopped. It seemed the maestro's condition was gradually improving.

"Maya said she's really grateful to you, Oppa. She said it's been a long time since she saw the maestro smile so brightly."

"Really?"

"Yes, she said it's been ages since the maestro smiled like that. And when you're practicing with him, he seems to have so much energy, as if he were decades younger."

Son Yooha's words weren't wrong. The maestro seemed much brighter and talkative than when they first met.

Especially when teaching conducting, he was so energetic that it was hard to believe he was in his twilight years.

Was it the excitement and thrill of conducting? Whatever it was, his stamina was comparable to that of a young man.

* * *

After sending Son Yooha back, he walked alone.

The end of the summer vacation was approaching. It had been almost a month since he started receiving lessons from the maestro.

Breathing in the night air under the full moon, he headed towards the forest beyond the garden.

"Hoo."

Exhaling the cold air, he picked up a fallen branch from the ground.

In his mind, the image of the maestro appeared.

Though a month had passed, the scene from that day was still vividly etched in his memory as if it had just happened.

He spread his legs shoulder-width apart and extended his arms as if holding a baby.

From the shoulders to the elbows to the fingertips. As the posture flowed naturally, the branch that replaced the baton felt like an extension of his body.

Adagio, the baton moved slowly as if time had stopped.

At the moment it sliced through the air, the full moon pointed to the tip of the branch.

In the tranquil forest, even the animals seemed to watch in wonder.

But this was just the beginning. The real conducting was yet to start.

* * *

Karas woke up early in the morning and got out of bed. Since Kang Hyun came to the mansion, her insomnia had vanished without a trace.

Missing her daughter also seemed to diminish, a positive change.

Breathing in the morning air, Karas walked to the garden.

Step.

The dew-covered garden bushes greeted her.

The pre-dawn air felt like it was sweeping through her lungs.

How long had she walked? Karas wore a puzzled expression and walked towards the forest beyond the garden.

Saa.

The forest sang, and the old trees seemed to dance with their heads together.

In the swaying breeze, the bushes shook off their dew, creating a sound.

The sound of the stream flowing added to it, making it seem like an orchestra of numerous instruments.

Then,

Hyun?

There was a scene that caught the maestro's eye. Under a towering old tree, Hyun was conducting.

It was the conducting she had shown him in passing a month ago. It was so beautiful that the maestro watched Hyun in a daze for a moment.

The maestro's eyes sparkled, and her throat bobbed. On closer look, he wasn't merely imitating her conducting.

Hyun, he was creating his own conducting style.

At that moment,

Flap.

A butterfly landed gently on the tip of the branch, signaling the end of the conducting.
