“Calvin Pharmaceuticals is getting interesting.”

Chairman Wang smiled and took a sip of tea. The information coming from a distant foreign land was as interesting as any drama.

Who would have thought that the fate of a pharmaceutical company developing a new anti-cancer virus drug would be in Kang Hyun's hands?

“Mr. Son, if you were Hyun, whose side would you take?”

“Of course, the side with more profit. Hyun has a keen eye for such matters.”

“Then are you saying he would side with Vice President Gerard?”

Chairman Yoo asked, and Chairman Wang nodded.

In terms of immediate profit, Gerard Calvin was better than John Calvin, the illegitimate son, because Gerard had inherited more assets.

At that moment, Chairman Wang began to speak slowly.

“Old man, do you know what surprised me when talking with Hyun?”

Chairman Yoo leaned forward, and Chairman Wang continued with an intrigued expression.

“It was before the financial crisis. South Korea was in a lull before the storm, but no one predicted that Daehan Steel would collapse so easily. But Hyun firmly said it would be the first to fall. Then he listed other companies that would follow, mostly big corporations. To an outsider, it would have sounded like crazy talk.”

But Hyun’s words became a reality.

“Just look at the IT-based companies Hyun is investing in. Most are still unknown, unbloomed enterprises. But Hyun boldly invests in them. If they fail, VH Company, where he invests, would suffer massive losses.”

High risk, high return.

To others, it might seem reckless. Investing heavily in unknown venture companies. No wonder Director Kim Sang-guk thought it was volunteering.

“But Hyun’s frightening aspect is that he knows the true meaning of value investing. He doesn’t buy the present; he buys the future.”

Chairman Wang laughed heartily, and Chairman Yoo joined. It was an unbelievable story.

A young man in his early twenties fully grasping the essence of value investing, which even they, with a lifetime of managing experience, hadn’t fully realized.

The reason the two elders were amazed was simple. Kang Hyun moved as if he could see the future.

For investors, nothing is as thrilling as a rising stock price. In that sense, Calvin Pharmaceuticals was like a treasure trove.

The stock price kept soaring day by day.

Calvin Pharmaceuticals’ shareholders must have felt like they were walking on clouds daily.

“Sir, we will be arriving at the shareholders' meeting venue soon.”

Director Kim Sang-guk seemed curious about my intentions. No wonder, as the emergency shareholders' meeting was imminent.

It was a meeting to appoint the new CEO of Calvin Pharmaceuticals.

With two vice presidents fiercely opposing each other, VH Company was the third-largest shareholder, holding a significant influence.

“Director, have you attended many shareholders' meetings?”

“Not a lot, but not few either. As you know, when I was at Jeil Group, it was a principle for the strategic planning office staff to stay out of the public eye.”

“Each company's shareholders' meeting has its unique atmosphere. Typically, the more poorly managed the company, the more exaggerated and excessive the hospitality.”

Reflecting on my past experiences, that was true.

While there were cases where shareholders caused a commotion, most would disappear with some hush money, and the real atmosphere of the company was influenced by the executives leading the meeting.

The more hollow the company, the more exaggerated it was.

“Is that so?”

Director Kim Sang-guk still seemed puzzled. It was understandable, as the shareholders' meetings he attended in the 1990s were different from what I remembered.

Inept management and rampant accounting fraud were the norms. Proper inquiries were rare.

“I have no intention of selling Calvin Pharmaceuticals’ stock yet.”

“Don’t you think it’s at its peak?”

“Pharmaceutical companies are different from IT industries. From a growth stock and value investing perspective, there’s nothing like a pharmaceutical company. As long as its performance is proven. In that sense, Calvin Pharmaceuticals is indispensable.”

They developed a new anti-cancer virus drug. With the patent protection, Calvin Pharmaceuticals would likely lead this field for the next thirty years. However,

“Like any company, the CEO’s leadership is crucial. The CEO’s character can determine the company’s fate.”

“The CEO’s character?”

“There are many examples in South Korea of companies that clearly show this.”

Many companies crumbled like sandcastles after the financial crisis. Behind it were the owner's family's poor management and widespread accounting fraud.

Is it different abroad? Now I understand why I didn’t remember the name Calvin Pharmaceuticals in my past life.

Without VH Company, Calvin would have naturally fallen into Gerard’s hands.

At that moment, the car arrived at the emergency shareholders' meeting venue.

“Maestro?”

Maya asked with a puzzled look at Maestro’s face, which was unusually happy.

Her gaze was directed toward the garden. There, Kang Hyun and Son Yooha were holding hands and strolling.

“Maya, it’s a truly beautiful sight.”

Maya felt immense gratitude towards Kang Hyun and Son Yooha. Maestro had struggled so much over the years, but Kang Hyun provided musical healing, and Son Yooha helped overcome loneliness.

While others called Kang Hyun a child chosen by the god of music, Maya thought differently.

“Maestro, he is truly a mysterious young man.”

“Yes. I am still amazed by Hyun. I taught him the same way my teacher taught me. A normal person would have given up, considering the methods were absurdly extreme. But Hyun practiced and practiced, believing my words were the truth.”

At first, she thought he was just a child with immense talent. But as time passed, she discovered Kang Hyun’s true nature.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call it the culmination of perseverance and effort. If he didn’t understand something, he would practice even at the cost of sleep.

Even when the doctor advised against overworking his body, he continued. How much more would he do normally?

“I understand why London and Berlin desire Hyun so much. Even if I had continued conducting, I would have wanted Hyun as my successor. But his talent is too precious to be confined to one place.”

If outsiders heard this, they wouldn’t believe it.

After all, London and Berlin are the ultimate goals for musicians.

Joining the world’s best orchestras like London and Berlin as a regular member was no easy feat.

But Maestro thought Hyun was too talented to stay only in London and Berlin.

“He is a perfect child in many ways. And look at that pure smile.”

“He looks happy.”

“Yes. He always seemed mature for his age, but with Yooha, he looks his age again.”

Maestro said softly while looking at Kang Hyun and Son Yooha.

“He is worthy of being a romanticist of the century.”

Cicada chirping―!

The end of summer approached.

During the summer break in Austria, I learned and felt so much. I discovered a conducting method entirely different from what I knew.

The difference between me before coming to Austria and now was significant.

“Sir, John Calvin, the president of Calvin Pharmaceuticals, wants to express his gratitude. How should we respond?”

The person I supported in the emergency shareholders' meeting was John Calvin.

Of course, I didn’t choose him because I was entirely satisfied. John Calvin, a researcher, was better than the empty shell Gerard. This decision would undoubtedly change the future.

“Tell him to repay the gratitude with stock prices. There’s no better gift for an investor than rising stock prices.”

Director Kim Sang-guk smiled as if he expected it. Then,

“Hyun, do you have a moment?”

Maestro had come to see me. Director Kim Sang-guk tactfully stepped aside. Maestro hesitated before speaking.

“There’s a place I want to show you.”

“A place?”

“Yes, a place I haven’t shown anyone.”

Maestro led, and I followed. As I walked down the corridor, a familiar place unfolded.

We arrived at the door of room 0703. She opened the door with her wrinkled hand.

Gulp.

Room 0703, which I thought might be haunted, was filled with a pink, cute atmosphere.

A typical girly room, with pink bedspreads and dressed-up Barbie dolls.

It even had a small piano and a child’s violin.

“This was my daughter Anna’s room. I couldn’t bear to tidy it up for many years, as I couldn’t forget Anna. I often visited this room at dawn to meet Anna. It was probably a hallucination.”

The room had been maintained for seventeen years. Maestro ran her dry lips and gently touched Anna’s belongings.

“It’s time to let Anna go. Anna in heaven wouldn’t want her mother to keep grieving. I plan to resume music.”

“Is that true, Maestro?”

“It’s all thanks to Hyun. Conducting with you made me realize that music still lives within me.”

What wonderful news.

It would undoubtedly excite classical music fans worldwide.

The legendary Maestro, who had been in seclusion, would return.

“Maestro, please stay healthy.”

How much time had passed? The sun was setting, and it was time to head to the airport.

As soon as I finished speaking, Son Yooha hugged Maestro tightly. With quivering hands, Maestro patted the sobbing Yooha’s back. They looked like a grandmother and granddaughter.

“I’ll come to Austria again next time!”

Son Yooha said, wiping her tears bravely. Maestro, touched, patted her head.

As the car drove away, I looked at the receding mansion. The Austrian mansion basked in the twilight, shining like a golden castle.

Then,

Huh?

Someone was waving from the mansion’s window. It seemed too small to be a maid. Besides, that room was supposed to be empty.

A chill ran down my spine as the face at the window came into focus.

It was a girl’s face, far away but seemingly thanking me.
