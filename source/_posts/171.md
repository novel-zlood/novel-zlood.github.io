“Dear, why are there so many pumpkin pancakes?”

Kang Sunwoo, Hyun's father, expressed his curiosity about the table filled with pumpkin pancakes. Even his father-in-law, who usually occupied the head seat, was nowhere to be seen.

“Father made them since dawn.”

“Father-in-law did?”

“Yes, he went to visit Mother’s grave early this morning. These days, he seems to visit often even when it's not her memorial day. I guess he thinks of her a lot.”

Though usually quiet and stoic, he was quite the romantic.

When visiting his wife’s grave, he always made sure to bring pumpkin pancakes and white milk, which she loved when she was alive.

He was a man who, reminiscing about his late wife who passed away decades ago, never looked at another woman.

Kang Sunwoo suddenly thought that his wife resembled her father very much.

“Dear, do you remember the day we first met?”

How could he forget? It was a time when government-organized demonstrations and rallies were in full swing. Of course, there were also constant protests and demonstrations at universities in opposition to this.

In the blooming spring of March, when tear gas powder spread instead of flower pollen, the two met.

“At that time, you fell among the crowd of demonstrators, and I helped you up. We ended up mingling with the demonstrators.”

The two university students, who had nothing to do with the demonstration, held hands and ran as soon as they got up. By the time they caught their breath and the tear gas smell had faded, they realized their hands were clasped tightly together like they’d been glued.

“If another man had helped you up, would you have followed him?”

“Don’t even say that. I followed you because it was you. From the first moment I saw you, you looked kind.”

“I looked kind?”

The young chemist's eyes were clearer and brighter than anything else. They captured the heart of a girl who had grown up gracefully as the youngest daughter of a wealthy family.

Mrs. Yoo Hyunja’s cheeks turned red, perhaps reminiscing about those days.

“By the way, I wonder when our son will get a girlfriend.”

Sunwoo smiled at his wife’s change of topic.

Contrary to his wife’s worries, there was no need to worry about their son’s romantic life. He received calls from matchmakers several times a day, not to mention fan letters that rivaled those of popular singers. Most importantly,

“Dear, you worry unnecessarily.”

Isn’t there already someone beside Hyun?

“Does it suit your taste?”

Son Yooha nodded with her mouth full of pork rice bowl. She looked so adorable that I almost burst out laughing.

It was a small door Kkachijip that I frequented next to the sundae stir-fry shop in Sillim-dong in my previous life. The shop was shabby, but the taste of the food made by the aunties was as good as any top chef. Even the picky Son Yooha kept exclaiming how delicious it was.

“Oppaa. Can you show me around the school?”

“Chew thoroughly and speak slowly.”

Though her appearance had matured, her personality remained the same as before.

I was quite flustered when I first saw her. A kid who had been in the U.S. suddenly flew to Korea.

Her matured appearance drew everyone's attention, making it uncomfortable to walk around with her.

No wonder, considering her looks were noticeable even behind her ice queen nickname in my previous life.

“I thought celebrities were eating here. You two look so beautiful and handsome, you match well.”

The Kkachijip auntie gave her blessing, making Yooha’s cheeks blush. Fortunately, we had plenty of time before the next class, giving us enough time to look around the school.

“Let’s go to Cheongwoldam first.”

Cheongwoldam referred to the pond in the center of the school.

As I held Yooha’s hand and walked, I felt people’s gazes. But I didn’t mind. Yooha gripped my hand even tighter.

It was a feeling I had never experienced in my past life. The school, which usually seemed dull, felt incredibly beautiful at that moment.

Then it happened.

Pitter-patter.

Was a tiger getting married? Large raindrops suddenly poured from the clear sky.

Without hesitation, I took off my coat and covered Yooha’s head. Then Yooha snuggled into my arms.

“Let’s run.”

Like a three-legged race, our feet moved in sync.

With each step, the pleasant scent mixed with the rain smell entered my nose. I didn’t know what shampoo she used, but I thought it was better than most perfumes.

The sound of raindrops hitting my coat or perhaps my heartbeat echoed in my ears.

“Kang Hyun.”

The professor called my name while looking at the attendance sheet. It was a first-year liberal arts course on conversational German. Yooha, who ended up taking the course with me, was also present.

When I entered the lecture hall holding Yooha’s hand, I could feel everyone’s attention focused on us.

Kim Daewoo widened his eyes as he glanced at Yooha, asking about her identity, but I didn’t answer.

“German is widely used in Europe. According to global statistics, it is the third most learned foreign language in the United States and across Europe. Moreover, its usage in the field of science is significant. Today, we will learn about Central German, which is considered the standard German.”

Yooha seemed more satisfied with sitting next to me than with the class content. She probably never imagined she’d be attending a university lecture with me.

Kim Daewoo and the other students’ faces were filled with curiosity. It was no wonder, considering I always avoided women as if I were in a forbidden zone. Then it happened.

“I will ask a simple conversational question in German.”

The professor scanned the room filled with students and pointed at someone.

It was none other than Son Yooha.

Oh no, I thought I should apologize immediately, but Yooha stood up slowly.

Her face showed no signs of nervousness or embarrassment. Instead, she looked cold and confident.

“Professor, should I answer in German?”

At that moment, Yooha fluently spoke German.

* * *

“Is she Hyun’s girlfriend?”

Kim Daewoo asked again, his eyes wide open. Before I could say anything, Yooha nodded repeatedly.

The male students exclaimed in surprise, while the female students sighed simultaneously.

Yooha’s face showed clear signs of relief.

“Daewoo, sorry but we have to go.”

“Oh, okay. Be careful.”

Leaving the surprised students behind, we left the department building quickly. We didn’t know what questions might come if we stayed.

Then Yooha squeezed my hand tightly. As if she wouldn’t let go.

“Oppa, I want to hear you play again after a long time.”

She’s more of an ice blockhead than an ice queen. She must have come to Korea to declare to everyone that she’s my girlfriend. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be this happy.

“Oppa, you’re really an adult now.”

Yooha murmured as she watched me drive. It felt odd hearing that from the future ice queen who would dominate Jeil Trading.

In my past life, Yooha was younger than me but held a much higher position. It was hard to even look her in the eye. Now, being able to meet her gaze felt unimaginable.

“VH Company?”

Yooha discovered something as she looked around the workshop, which she hadn’t visited in a long time.

The workshop was a place where no one could enter without my permission. Seeing the report that Director Kim Sang-guk had personally brought, Yooha looked puzzled.

“It’s nothing.”

“Hmmm, suspicious. Oppa, my business teacher said investments should always be made cautiously. If you’re thinking of investing in a company called VH Company, why not ask Grandfather?”

No need, I'm the CEO of VH Company.

From Yooha’s perspective, who was learning various subjects including leadership, she might be worried about me. Surely, she had knowledge equivalent to a university student’s at a young age.

“Anyway, sit here. I’ve wanted to play this piece for you for a long time.”

With Yooha seated, I picked up the violin. It was the final piece from my second album.

At the first note from the bow touching the strings, Yooha’s smile bloomed.

She must have recognized the piece immediately. She moved her posture forward, looking happy like a cat enjoying a treat.

Though the piece wasn’t technically complex, its simple melody evoked strong emotions.

Each time our eyes met, my heartbeat felt like it was adding an accompaniment like the sound of waves.

When the performance ended, Yooha had her eyes closed. She must have been tired from the day.

“You’ll catch a cold if you sleep like this.”

As I carefully approached the sofa where Yooha was lying to cover her with a blanket, I noticed she was already sound asleep.

Just as I was about to cover her with the blanket,

Huh?

Yooha suddenly opened her eyes halfway and hugged my neck tightly.

It felt like gravity was pulling me down as I leaned closer, our eyes meeting just a hand’s breadth away, making time feel like it had stopped.

“VH Company?”

A voice filled with confusion and surprise.

“Yes. Our CEO is considering investing in your company.”

“Wait a minute. We are still a newly established company.”

Of course, it was one of the many IT venture companies popping up like mushrooms.

The person sitting across still looked puzzled.

Kim Sang-guk took a sip of tea, moistening his lips, and began to speak to the nervous person.

“Have you heard of VH Company?”

“Of course, who in the IT industry hasn’t heard of VH Company? But I never imagined you would contact us. As you know, we are still in the early stages, without any visible achievements yet.”

The other person’s voice grew quieter and quieter. Understandably, to attract investment, one must have corresponding work, which was still minimal.

Moreover, predicting the future potential of the young CEO before him wasn’t very reassuring.

“As you know, our VH Company loves adventure. Our investment philosophy is aligned with our CEO’s life philosophy, ‘It takes too long to check a stone bridge before crossing.’ This investment is based on the potential we see in your company. Would you like to review the investment proposal?”

The sound of gulping could be heard. Surely, from the other’s perspective, it was like winning the lottery.

Kim Sang-guk had been making consistent investment proposals over the past few months. Once, he even proposed an investment to a venture company that seemed to have no future potential.

Such an approach was unimaginable when he worked in strategic planning.

‘This is unbelievable.’

Initially, Kang Hyun’s investment methods seemed unreliable. But as time passed, the incredible results left him astounded. It was no wonder people started calling Kang Hyun the Midas touch. He was curious to see how the venture company before him would turn out.

“We will do our utmost not to let VH Company down.”

The other person bowed deeply, clutching the investment proposal tightly.

After the financial crisis, investments in small businesses had noticeably decreased. The government focused on saving large corporations, implementing policies accordingly. Hence, for small venture companies, VH Company seemed like a lifeline from heaven.

Then it happened.

“Wait a minute.”

At that moment, Kim Sang-guk’s eyes caught the English newspaper a hotel staff was carrying. More precisely, his eyes were fixed on the headline.

Perhaps due to his persistent gaze, the hotel staff handed him a copy of the newspaper. Without even thanking him, Kim Sang-guk read the headline as if he were possessed.

“Barbara Mine, Largest Copper and Gold Discovery in History.”

Another miraculous moment was unfolding.
