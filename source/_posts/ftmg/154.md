Dudududung―!

At the sound of the heartbeat resonating from the screen, Son Yooha clenched her hands. Seeing Kang Hyun dressed in a tailcoat made her heart pound as if it were malfunctioning.

Michelle was fussing and saying something to Yooha, but she couldn't hear a thing. Yooha's eyes and ears were solely focused on Kang Hyun.

The filming camera alternated between the orchestra and the audience.

The audience was filled with numerous people, many of whom appeared to be distinguished figures. When the camera showed the queen, Michelle exclaimed, "It's Queen Elizabeth!"

Even though she was just watching a video, Yooha felt a tense pressure throughout her body. She wondered how much pressure those on stage must be feeling on their shoulders.

"Oppa―!"

Son Yooha was worried Kang Hyun might make a mistake. But it was just a groundless worry.

The signal from the horn marked the beginning of the majestic melody, captivating the audience with the prelude of strings and powerful percussion.

When Kang Hyun closed his eyes slowly, Yooha's friends squealed in excitement.

"Yooha, is he really your boyfriend?"

"Blair, I'm telling you, it's true. I've seen that oppa come to meet Yooha. He's even more handsome in person."

"Oh my god! Don't get me wrong, I asked because he's so cool. I was really curious about who managed to win the queen bee of Philip's heart, but if it's that guy, I get it. Yooha, you need to be careful. Many girls who watch this broadcast will send him fan letters. Especially the British girls, they love that intellectual charisma!"

Usually, they were mature, learning things like royal studies, but now they were unmistakably teenage girls.

They couldn't help but scream and admire Kang Hyun's every gesture, like they were idolizing the male lead from a teen drama.

When the majestic hymn resounded, no one could open their mouths.

At that moment, Yooha recalled a famous quote by Saint-Exupéry.

"Love is not looking at each other, but looking together in the same direction."

While she was unable to return to Korea, Kang Hyun had already decided on his path and was moving forward.

Yooha vowed to walk her own path so that she wouldn't be lacking compared to Kang Hyun, praying for the day they could walk side by side.

"Yoppa (beautiful)!"

Barbara clapped her hands together. Her face, which rarely showed expression, was brimming with excitement.

She thought he was a mysterious boy. Not only did he propose a deal to her, but he also gave lectures to senior professors at Juilliard.

Moreover, now he was conducting for the British royal family.

"Tanya, isn't he really amazing?"

"Yes, indeed. Even when you met him before, Barbara, he didn't seem intimidated at all. It's the same now. Who would have imagined a boy captivating the attention of the British royal family?"

"The more I know him, the more I like him."

Barbara had known about Kang Hyun from the start because he was the one who did the dubbing for her beloved Jewish film, "Rabin Rose."

But she hadn't expected her fondness to turn into such a strong curiosity.

People who are not skilled in negotiation often freeze like a deer in headlights when meeting someone of higher status.

But Kang Hyun was different. Like his moniker, "the mysterious boy," he handled her skillfully, like a seasoned trainer with years of experience.

"Tanya, how is the situation in Nepal?"

As soon as Barbara finished speaking, Tanya brought a new exploration report.

Barbara's eyes sparkled. Even though she had heard the verbal report from the team leader, the contents of the written report were enough to make her clench her hands.

Repeated radial geological surveys in the exploration area had exceeded predictions in terms of reserves and distribution. The purity of the gold was also beyond words.

If this fact became known, Barbara Mining's stock, which was already hitting the upper limit, would skyrocket, being regarded as a treasure trove of instant wealth.

"Tanya, prepare immediately."

"Barbara, where is our destination?"

"We must head to Windsor to celebrate our friend's successful conduct!"

It was a reference to the British royal family, the House of Windsor. Barbara's brown eyes reflected the hand of the young maestro moving the world.

To reach the sun, to reach the sun, like a rising fantasy―!

It was a continuous majestic hymn like the resonance of timpani.

The sharp baton sliced through the melody like a gust of wind.

With his eyes closed, Kang Hyun was enveloped in the song of the fourth movement.

The members of the London Symphony were also pouring their passion into the resonance they created.

Concertmaster Dmitri gripped his bow tightly, feeling the surge of exhilaration that shook his cold eyes.

At the concertmaster's signal, the strings met the bow together. Breaking through the deep bass created by the contrabass and cello, the choir's cry resounded once more.

Spencer, sitting in the audience, didn't hide his expression. His cheeks twitched continuously, and his wrinkled eyes glistened with tears of joy as he looked at Kang Hyun.

Even his now-weakened shoulders trembled, likely from the overwhelming emotion.

Kwaduk.

When he first met Kang Hyun, he only saw potential and didn't believe in the term "prodigy." He thought all prodigies died after Mozart.

But the boy who had changed his worldview was now presenting a new future.

Dudududung―!

As the music crescendoed, the audience couldn't take their eyes off the orchestra. It was a performance that surpassed a mere celebratory concert, making them feel like they were part of a historic premiere. Everyone was tense, waiting for the grand finale.

At that moment, Kang Hyun's hand slowly slowed down and then pointed to the sky.

At the young maestro's signal, the entire orchestra, including percussion and wind instruments, resounded together.

The hymn of the choir and the orchestra's melody, resounding like a rising fantasy, was nothing short of spectacular.

Even after the baton was lowered, the audience couldn't easily open their mouths. The viewers beyond the camera must have felt the same.

Everyone was left speechless by the overwhelming finale that sent chills down their spines and made their hair stand on end.

Gang Hyun Symphony No. 1

Kang Hyun's tailcoat fluttered as he faced the audience. The members of the orchestra stood up together, and Kang Hyun, representing the London Symphony, thanked the audience. Everyone glimpsed the future of this young boy.

Who started it? Like a raindrop falling into the vast sea, the small sound of applause began and soon turned into a standing ovation as the audience rose from their seats.

As the waves of emotion continued, the Queen of Windsor stood up to bless the London Symphony for welcoming a new maestro.

"What are you looking at, Mr. Son?"

Chairman Wang took out a photo from an album and handed it to Chairman Yoo. It was a picture of Yooha and Kang Hyun standing together.

The grandfathers smiled at the sight of the shy boy and girl looking at the film camera.

Meanwhile, the savory smell of perilla seeds was wafting from the kitchen.

"Hyunja is making chicken stew with lots of perilla seeds, so stay for a meal. Lately, Hyunja has been busy because you're visiting Ichon-dong almost every day."

Although he said that, Chairman Yoo was secretly grateful for the visits from his childhood friend, Chairman Wang. Despite being busy with his own company, Wang was also keeping an eye on Dongju's business as if it were his own.

Chairman Wang carefully put the photo back into the album and looked at Chairman Yoo.

"Old friend, my heart still trembles when I think about the last part of the symphony."

"So does mine. When the audience erupted in cheers, we were there with them."

"Indeed, someone might have thought we won the World Cup. The whole of Ichon-dong seemed to be reverberating. And I heard from my daughter-in-law that the news and newspapers were also in a frenzy."

As soon as Kang Hyun's conduct ended, newspapers rushed to publish articles about him.

The news was the same. It was the same spotlight as when golfer Park Se-ri was conquering the U.S. stage.

"Who would have thought the child, who disliked attention, would receive so much of it? He used to decline interviews from major broadcasters, but now it's impossible to stop them. Reporters are even contacting Mr. Kang directly."

"It can't be helped. The times are shining a light on him."

Chairman Wang smiled contentedly. In the midst of a national economic crisis, a beacon of light had appeared. It was like the saying that heroes are born in turbulent times.

"By the way, when is Hyun coming to Korea?"

"I heard he might come after the festival in England. It seems there are many people he needs to meet there."

Just then, the voice of the housekeeper announced that the chicken stew was ready. Chairman Wang stood up and quietly said to the photo,

"I can't wait to see you, my grandson-in-law."

Elegant and sophisticated ornaments were a feast for the eyes. It was a room with such dignity that it outshone most hotels. It was a royal residence similar to Buckingham Palace.

Even after staying there for several days, waking up to the morning sunlight always made me feel like I was living in an English novel.

"Ah, this is the taste!"

The royal chef didn't disappoint, even with Eastern cuisine. Food was the best remedy for homesickness.

Though I wanted to return to Korea immediately, I couldn't out of courtesy. I had to stay and enjoy the banquet until the royal festival ended.

Now, even people I had never met before were requesting to meet me almost every day.

"Chrissy, we're scheduled to meet Mr. Su today, right?"

"Yes, Hyun. We have lunch scheduled with him. Thanks to the royal family's consideration, Mr. Su will be visiting the residence directly."

I never imagined I would be sleeping in a royal estate owned by the British royal family.

Though it was called a mansion, it was practically a palace. The grounds were so vast that one could get lost without a map, and there were numerous buildings. I heard that members of the royal family were also staying somewhere on the grounds.

"I'll go for a walk in the garden alone. I won't have any alone time after lunch, as I'll be meeting people."

Chrissy hesitated for a moment before nodding.

She decided that no one would dare trespass on the royal estate.

Step.

An unknown fragrance tickled my nose. The lush old trees were soothing to the eyes, and the brilliant sunlight streaming through the leaves refreshed my face as if I had washed it.

As I walked, I saw a greenhouse. Through the slightly open door, numerous flowers came into view. The pleasant scent filling the garden seemed to be coming from there.

It was then.

"The fragrance is nice, isn't it?"

Startled by the sudden voice, I looked up to see someone walking out of the greenhouse.

Soft, silky white hair and blue eyes met my gaze.

Though her voice was reminiscent of a familiar grandmother, her elegant and graceful steps seemed to radiate an aura.

"Your Majesty?"

I unconsciously raised my voice in surprise at the unexpected encounter.
