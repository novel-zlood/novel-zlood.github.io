두두두둥―!

From beyond the screen, the pounding sound resonated, and Son Yooha clenched her hands tightly. Her heart pounded as if it were broken at the sight of Kang Hyun in his tuxedo.

Michelle fussed and said something to Yooha, but there was no way she could hear it. Yooha's eyes and ears were solely fixed on Kang Hyun.

The filming camera alternated between the orchestra and the audience.

The audience was filled with numerous people, all of whom seemed extraordinary at a glance. When the camera showed the queen, Michelle exclaimed, "It's Queen Elizabeth!"

Even though it was just watching a video, the tension that enveloped her was palpable. How much stronger must the pressure be on their shoulders on that stage?

"Oppa―!"

Son Yooha worried that Kang Hyun might make a mistake. But it was just needless anxiety.

The signal of the horn, along with the start of the majestic melody, and the prelude of the strings and intense percussion captured her ears.

Yooha's friends squealed with delight at the sight of Kang Hyun with his eyes gently closed.

"Yooha, is that really your boyfriend?"

"Blair, I'm telling you, it's true. I've seen that oppa come to meet Yooha. He's even more handsome in person."

"Oh my God! Don't get me wrong, I asked because he's so cool. I was really curious who snatched our school's queen, and if it's that guy, I admit it. Yooha should be more nervous. Today, countless female students who watched this broadcast will desperately send him fan letters. Especially the studious ones in the UK, they go wild for that intellectual charisma―!"

Although they usually showed mature aspects by learning statecraft, now they were unmistakably teenage girls.

They couldn't help but exclaim and scream at Kang Hyun's every gesture. It was just like admiring the male protagonist in a teen drama.

No one could open their mouth when the majestic hymn resonated.

At that moment, Son Yooha recalled Saint-Exupéry's famous quote.

"Love is not about looking at each other, but about looking together in the same direction."

While she was unable to visit Korea, Kang Hyun had already set his path and was moving forward.

Yooha resolved to walk her own path as well, so she wouldn't fall short of Kang Hyun. She prayed for the day they could walk side by side.

"Yobba (Beautiful)!"

Barbara clapped her hands. His usually expressionless face was now filled with excitement.

He thought Kang Hyun was a mysterious boy. Not only had he proposed a deal to him, but he also gave lectures to senior professors at Juilliard.

Moreover, now he was even conducting for the British Royal Family.

"Tanya, isn't he amazing?"

"Yes, indeed. When we met Barbara before, he didn't appear intimidated at all. And now, he’s receiving the attention of the British Royal Family. Unimaginable things are happening."

"The more I know him, the more I like him."

Barbara had already known about Kang Hyun. He was the one who was in charge of the simultaneous recording of the Jewish movie "La Vie en Rose," which Barbara loved.

But he didn't expect that his liking would turn into such intense curiosity.

Inexperienced dealers often freeze up like prey in front of a predator when they meet someone of higher status.

But Kang Hyun was different. Like the nickname "mysterious boy," he handled him expertly. Like an experienced trainer with years of experience.

"Tanya, how are things in Nepal?"

As soon as Barbara finished speaking, Tanya brought over a new exploration report.

Barbara's eyes sparkled. He had already heard the verbal report from the exploration team leader, but the contents of the actual written report were gripping enough to make him clench his hands.

Repeated geological surveys in a radial pattern in the exploration area exceeded expectations in terms of reserves and distribution. The purity of the gold was beyond words.

If this fact were to be revealed, Barbara Mining's stock, which was already hitting its upper limit, would skyrocket and be regarded as a treasure of immense wealth.

"Tanya, get ready now."

"Barbara, where would you like to go?"

"We must head to Windsor to congratulate a friend on his successful conducting!"

By Windsor, he meant the British Royal Family. Barbara's brown eyes were filled with the image of a young maestro moving the world with his fingertips.

To reach the sun, to reach the sun, like a rising fantasy―!

It was a series of grand hymns, like the majestic sound of timpani.

The sharp baton cut through the melody like a gust of wind.

The 4th movement's song pierced Kang Hyun's ears, who had his eyes gently closed.

The members of the London Symphony Orchestra were also pouring all their passion into the resonance they created.

Concertmaster Dmitri gripped his bow with enough force to make his cold eyes tremble with rising excitement.

At the signal from the concertmaster, the strings began to move their bows. The deep bass created by the contrabass and cello pierced through, and the choir's cry resonated once again.

Spencer, sitting in the audience, didn't hide his expression. His cheeks twitched continuously, and his wrinkled eyes welled up with tears as he watched Kang Hyun, as if filled with joy.

Even his shoulders, which were no longer healthy, shook. It must have been trembling with overwhelming emotion.

Crack.

When he first met Kang Hyun, he merely saw potential and didn't believe in the term "prodigy." He thought all prodigies died after Mozart.

But the boy who had changed his worldview was now presenting a new future.

두두두둥―!

In the rising dynamics, the audience could not take their eyes off the orchestra. It was a performance beyond the level of a simple celebratory concert. It felt as if they were present at a historical premiere. Everyone held their breath, waiting for the grand finale of the epic.

At that moment, Kang Hyun's fingertips seemed to slow down and then pointed to the sky.

At the young maestro's signal, the entire orchestra, including percussion and wind instruments, resonated together.

The orchestra's melody, resonating with the grand hymn of the choir, was a spectacular sight like a rising fantasy.

Even though the baton pointed to the ground, the audience couldn't easily open their mouths. It would have been the same for the viewers watching beyond the camera.

Everyone was unable to shake off the lingering feelings from the majestic finale that sent shivers down their spines and tingled their scalps.

Gang Hyun Symphony No.1

Kang Hyun's tuxedo fluttered as he faced the audience. The members stood up together, and Kang Hyun, representing the London Symphony, thanked the audience.

Who started it? Like a drop of rain falling into a vast ocean, a small applause turned into a tidal wave of standing ovations.

As the wave of emotions continued, the Queen of Windsor stood up and blessed the London Symphony, welcoming the new maestro.

"Son, what are you looking at?"

Chairman Wang took a photo from the album and handed it to Chairman Yoo. It was a picture of Yooha and Kang Hyun standing together.

The grandfathers smiled at the sight of the boy and girl shyly looking at the film camera.

Just then, the savory smell of perilla seeds wafted from the kitchen.

"Hyunja is making chicken stew with plenty of perilla seed powder, so stay and eat. These days, Son, you come to Ichon-dong so often that Hyunja has a hard time."

Although he said that, Chairman Yoo was secretly grateful for Chairman Wang's visits. Despite being busy with his own company's work, he kept an eye on Dongju Chemical as if it were his own Daeil Group.

Chairman Wang carefully placed the photo back into the album and looked at Chairman Yoo.

"Old friend, my heart still trembles when I think of the last part of the symphony."

"Me too. When the audience in the seats cheered in joy, we were there together, weren't we?"

"Indeed, anyone would have thought we won the World Cup. It felt like the whole of Ichon-dong was echoing. And I heard from my daughter-in-law that even the news and newspapers went wild."

As soon as Kang Hyun's conducting ended, newspapers competed to publish articles about him.

The news was the same. It received the same spotlight as when pro golfer Se-ri Pak was dominating the American stage.

"Son, who would have thought that a kid who dislikes attention would receive so much of it? He turned down several major broadcast interviews, but now we can't stop it. Reporters are even directly contacting Kang Hyun."

"It can't be helped. The times are shining a light on that boy."

Chairman Wang smiled contentedly. In the midst of a national economic crisis like the foreign exchange crisis, a ray of light had appeared. It was like the saying that heroes are born in troubled times, and Kang Hyun fit that image perfectly.

"In-law, when is Hyun coming to Korea?"

"I heard he will come after the festival in England. He seems to have a lot of people to meet in England."

Just then, the housekeeper's voice called out, indicating that the chicken stew was ready. Chairman Wang stood up and spoke softly toward the photo.

"I can't wait to see you, my granddaughter's husband."

The elegant and sophisticated ornaments were a feast for the eyes. It was a room so dignified that most hotels couldn't compare. It was a royal family-owned residence, just like Buckingham Palace.

Although I had been staying for several days, every time I woke up to the morning sunlight, I felt like I was in an English novel.

"Ah, this is the taste―!"

As expected of the royal family's chef, even Eastern food was excellently prepared. Food was the best cure for homesickness.

Although I wanted to return to Korea immediately, I couldn't out of courtesy. I had to enjoy the banquet until the royal festival was over.

Now, every day, even famous people I had never met wanted to meet me.

"Chrissy, we have an appointment with Mr. Soo today, right?"

"Yes, Hyun. We have lunch scheduled today. Thanks to the royal family's consideration, Mr. Soo will visit the residence personally."

I never thought I would end up sleeping in a mansion owned by the British royal family.

It was called a mansion, but it was practically a palace. The estate was so vast that you could get lost without a map, and there were numerous buildings. I heard that members of the royal family were also staying somewhere here.

"I'll take a solo walk in the garden. After lunch, I won't have any time to myself because I'll be meeting people all day."

Chrissy hesitated for a moment but then nodded.

She judged that there wouldn't be anyone bold enough to intrude on the royal family's property.

Thud.

The scent of unknown flowers tickled my nose. The lush old trees were soothing to the eyes, and the brilliant rays of light filtering through the leaves refreshed my face like a morning wash.

As I walked, I saw a greenhouse. Through the slightly open door, I could see numerous flowers. The pleasant scent filling the garden must have come from here.

It was then.

"Doesn't it smell wonderful?"

A voice suddenly came, and as I looked up, someone was walking out of the greenhouse.

I saw silk-like soft white hair and soon met blue eyes.

The voice felt familiar and comforting like an old grandmother's, but her elegant and graceful steps seemed to radiate an aura.

"Your Majesty?"
