"Does anyone have a groundbreaking idea?"

Silence and stillness filled the room.

"I heard the educational program at S Corporation got Park Chan-ho and their ratings skyrocketed. How long are we going to waste time? You guys, who have been in broadcasting long enough, have such poor imagination. At this rate, our flagship program will end up being Animal Kingdom!"

The director's nagging poured down warmly from the morning.

Who wouldn't want to create a golden goose-like program with high ratings? However, the always lacking manpower and minimal production budget fail to meet even the basic conditions.

True professionals don't make excuses?

Bullshit.

Anyone who has worked in broadcasting even a bit knows how crucial labor costs and production budgets are.

To exaggerate, unless you're an alchemist who turns lead into gold, creating a top-notch program is a distant dream.

"Producer Kim, what do you think?"

"Yes?"

"You usually talk a lot, but today you can't even understand plain words. Do you have a way to break through this crisis?"

Oh no, the director's arrow shot towards me. I hastily sent out an SOS signal, but the other producers just looked away, relieved that they weren't the targets.

When I turned my head to look forward, the director's glaring eyes were right in front of me. It was like looking at an angry English bulldog.

"I do!"

"Instead of just making excuses every time, what do you have?"

"Yes, I have one way to break through this crisis."

The director and the fellow producers turned their heads with curious gazes. Well, you can't lose more than you've already lost. If I back down now, I'll be chewed out by the bulldog-like director for weeks.

The director always nagged the producers to foster imagination, and now it was time to fully demonstrate that imagination.

"We need to get violinist Kang Hyun."

"Kang Hyun?"

"Yes, you know that boy who became famous for conducting for the British Royal Family. My sister works as a reporter for a record company, and she heard that Kang Hyun and pianist Baek Junghoon will be conducting together this time. It's a widely known rumor in that industry."

Kang Hyun had already garnered nationwide attention.

He was the one who caused a classical album syndrome in South Korea, known to be barren in classical music. There's no need to say more.

Moreover, pianist Baek Junghoon also had a significant fan base.

"But their appearance fees would be a problem. Their conditions are expected to be quite demanding, especially for someone like Kang Hyun who rarely appears on TV or gives interviews, maintaining a mysterious image like Seo Taiji. However, if we can get them to appear on our program, I believe we can achieve tremendous ratings."

The die was cast. The fellow producers were stunned. They never imagined the name Kang Hyun would come up.

Sure, if S Corporation could bring in a sports star like Park Chan-ho, we should at least bet on someone like Kang Hyun.

But it was an obviously doomed proposal. As mentioned before, we couldn't afford their appearance fees. At that moment,

"Producer Kim, do you think it's possible?"

"Yes?"

"If we can meet their appearance fees and conditions, do you think it's possible? I'll personally go to the president's office and beg on my knees for approval."

The director's eyes burned with determination.

"A documentary?"

It was an unexpected proposal. Didn't you avoid media exposure and refrain from interviews in the first place? Facing the broadcast cameras was a different matter altogether.

"The broadcasting station offered quite favorable conditions. It could be a gift to your waiting fans and might help revive classical music culture in South Korea in the long run."

"Director, but a documentary shoot is a bit much."

Do you think there won't be a script just because it's a documentary?

I realized from the documentary filmed at the Judicial Research and Training Institute in my past life that broadcasters can't be trusted.

They made us reshoot the same scene several times and even gave us scripts for trivial daily conversations.

If you think a documentary is a hundred percent raw, you're mistaken.

"The filming crew promised not to interfere directly. They just want to capture the days you and Junghoon prepare for the concert. They also promised to stop filming anytime if you don't like it. Honestly, I'm worried that you're too mysterious."

Didn't I vow to live a life of simple happiness?

In my past life, I wasted my life chasing material desires and power. This time, I vowed to live according to primal happiness.

But as I engaged in music, I seemed to be attracting more attention and success than in my past life.

"Hyung, what do you think?"

"I think it's okay. You're very famous, but it's true that lesser-known musicians struggle to fill seats at solo recitals. It would be great if this could spark a classical music boom in South Korea."

Baek Junghoon agreed with the broadcasting shoot out of moral duty. After all, lesser-known musicians find it challenging to fill seats even for free solo recitals.

"Okay, but I have conditions."

"Conditions?"

"I want the broadcasting company to produce a program that promotes unknown musicians in the future. And please donate all my appearance fees anonymously. We need to help others in these tough times."

At that moment, Baek Junghoon, standing next to me, also announced that he would donate all his appearance fees.

Im Hyera, the director, smiled faintly. She probably didn't expect me to make such a proposal.

"And this needs to be discussed with Junghoon hyung, but I want to donate all my proceeds from the concert as well."

"Really?"

"I trust you'll find a good place to donate the funds."

The reason Im Hyera was surprised was simple. The revenues from solo and other concerts far surpassed what ordinary people could imagine.

But weren't my desires for money already worn out? To exaggerate, the investment returns from VH Company alone were enough to support three generations without worry.

By the way,

"When does the filming begin?"

At that moment, Director Im Hyera pointed her finger at the ceiling. On the ceiling of the director's office, translucent LCD cameras were installed.

It was the moment a good story about violinist Hyun was being created.

Swoosh—!

The golf ball flew in a graceful arc.

At the picturesque Gapyeong Country Club, only Chairman Wang and Kim Sang-guk were playing a round.

Chairman Wang handed over the driver to the caddy and looked at Kim Sang-guk.

"I feel like my skills improve when I play golf with you."

"Isn't it because you're so good at putting, Chairman? Considering your age, even semi-professionals would hesitate to compete with you."

"Ha! Ever since hanging around with Kang Hyun, you seem to have learned the art of flattery. You used to be so stiff like a robot."

It wasn't just a saying. Kim Sang-guk, who used to boast a chiseled jawline and intense eyes, now had a more gentle appearance.

But the sharpness still existed within his gentleness.

"Are you getting a lot of calls these days?"

"Yes, ever since the meeting at the Seungjeongwon, not only the top five domestic companies but also the Blue House has been contacting us. Even in the Strategic Planning Office, I never experienced something like this, so it's bewildering."

"What did Hyun say to do?"

"He said to let things flow naturally. Honestly, I was surprised. He not only declined the investment delegation proposed by Barbara Group but also rejected various investment offers from the top five companies."

The reason Kim Sang-guk was surprised was simple. Anyone would know that no one is powerless in front of money. But Kang Hyun was an exception.

He declined investment offers from both Barbara Group and the top five domestic companies. At that time, Kang Hyun seemed almost like a monk who had renounced worldly desires.

"Can I ask about the investment performance of VH Company? As you know, besides Chairman Yoo, I also have stakes in VH Company."

"Just as the top executives of the top five companies were surprised at Seungjeongwon, the visible achievements are astonishing. Even I, who spent decades in the Strategic Planning Office, find it hard to believe. Others might have felt like they were seeing a ghost. Especially, President Son Ilsung called me separately to ask if I had coached Representative Kang Hyun on his investment strategies."

It was nonsense. If Kim Sang-guk had indeed coached Kang Hyun on his investment strategies, he wouldn't be in the Strategic Planning Office but running a company himself.

Every time Kim Sang-guk witnessed Kang Hyun's investment strategies, it felt new. It was spine-chilling when everything fit together perfectly like solving a puzzle.

"I'm Producer Kim Dohyun. Nice to meet you!"

When the producer bowed excessively, it was hard not to feel overwhelmed.

Both the cameraman and the producer followed Kang Hyun like bodyguards.

Thankfully, there was no script, but the camera never missed a moment, always keeping an eye on Kang Hyun and Baek Junghoon.

"Let's do it again."

The orchestra performing at the concert was the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra.

Though they were already acquainted with Kang Hyun, the presence of the broadcast cameras seemed to make the members visibly tense. This only made them put more effort into the rehearsal.

At that moment, the hands that were slicing through the air on stage came together.

"Again."

It was the conductor's job to identify off-key notes. Managing the tempo and breathing of the ensemble was also his responsibility. Before long, he seemed to have forgotten about the cameras and was fully immersed in conducting. The members were also getting more engrossed in their performance. However,

"Again."

The errors appeared without fail. There could never be a perfect performance, but giving one's best was an immutable rule.

Baek Junghoon, seated in the audience, also looked at the stage with a tense face.

"Violin—!"

At that moment, Kang Hyun's eyes met with the young member who had been continuously making mistakes.

It was clear that the member was young, probably a recent graduate from music school. No doubt, he must have swept the domestic competitions to be admitted to the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra.

"Do you know where you went wrong?"

"I'm, I'm sorry."

"The second violin, which is supposed to handle the harmony, keeps playing off-key. You're also half a beat late in following the concertmaster's signal."

It was like watching a strict tiger teacher. The members couldn't move their lips in front of Kang Hyun.

After all, even the senior members who had been in the orchestra for decades were amazed by Kang Hyun's precise skills.

A typical conductor wouldn't have noticed the recent violinist's mistakes.

"If it's not too much trouble, may I show you a demonstration?"

"Yes?"

"Isn't it better to see once than to keep hearing theoretical explanations?"

Kang Hyun took the violin from the member.

He placed the baton on the stand and quickly took position.

Like flowing water, the violin settled on his shoulder, and the bow touched the strings.

He flawlessly executed a part of the symphony they had just played, almost like a lie. Moreover, he played it in two versions.

"The first version is the proper rendition of the melody, and the second is the melody with the mistakes the member here kept making. Do you understand the difference?"

The member nodded repeatedly, like a mute who had eaten honey. The eyes of those watching were filled with admiration and surprise. It was because they couldn't believe someone could precisely replicate a passing mistake so perfectly.

At that moment, the broadcast camera captured every scene without missing a single detail.
