"Tsk."

Spencer clicked his tongue in disappointment. Why did Kang Hyun's New York performance have to coincide with the London Symphony's schedule? He wanted to go to New York immediately, but it was impossible.

There was no need to mention how popular Kang Hyun's New York performance was. Major media outlets, including the UK's Daily Telegraph, Independent, and Guardian, had published columns expressing their anticipation for his performance in New York.

"Maestro, you seem quite disappointed."

At that moment, concertmaster Dmitri entered the conductor's room with a rare smile.

"That rascal didn't even send me a ticket."

"If it's Hyun, he probably knows the London Symphony's schedule well. He wouldn't want to cause any unnecessary concerns for the two maestros."

"Or maybe the ticket prices are just too expensive?"

Spencer joked as he opened the newspaper. One part of the column even mentioned that tickets for Kang Hyun's New York performance were being sold on the black market at prices comparable to the Super Bowl.

Could such a thing really happen in the 21st century? He thought the era when classical music was the center of popular music had long passed.

"When is Maestro Karas supposed to arrive?"

"He said in a week. As soon as his schedule in Austria is over, he will join the members and proceed with the rehearsal. Even now, he calls me several times a day to check on the members' practice status."

"I thought I was giving him plenty of time considering his age, but that was my mistake."

Spencer smiled pleasantly.

It was no exaggeration to say that the London Symphony had entered a second golden age after the recruitment of the legendary Karas.

Though Karas couldn't often appear on stage due to his age and physical condition, he supported Spencer like a conductor offstage.

With two of the world's top-notch conductors coaching the members simultaneously, it was natural for the London Symphony's skills to improve.

"Maestro also seemed very interested in Hyun's performance."

"That rascal, wouldn't it be great if he performed in London instead of with the New York Philharmonic? At this rate, the Empress and I will have to keep holding the baton. Maybe he'll come after his shoulders are dislocated."

"Maestro, don't joke like that. In my opinion, both of you are still very healthy."

Dmitri showed a warm smile that contrasted with his cold eyes.

The chemistry between Karas and Spencer was nothing short of heavenly. They also had an immense love for the London Symphony.

There were rumors that the Berlin Philharmonic had also contacted the Empress, but she ultimately chose the London Symphony. Of course, Kang Hyun had played a significant role in that decision.

"There's even talk that Hyun will bring back the glory of classical music. There's already a classical boom among American teenagers."

"Classical booms do occur in the upper classes from time to time."

"It's different from a social craze. Friends who are active as violinists in the U.S. say that teaching instruments to kids has become a cultural norm, regardless of social class. Of course, this successful myth of Hyun entering the Billboard charts plays a significant role."

Indeed, who would've thought classical music, which always had a minor commercial appeal, would aim for the number one spot on the Billboard singles chart?

News of it breaking into the top seven and settling in the top three was already reaching the UK. It was an unstoppable reverse trend.

"Grammophone and Deutsche have already evaluated Hyun's entry into the Billboard charts as a milestone in classical music history."

"A milestone in classical music history..."

It wasn't wrong. Initially, everyone thought a prodigy had appeared. An Asian boy winning the Queen Elisabeth Competition as the youngest ever was nothing short of sensational.

But his journey didn't stop there. He continued to create unbelievable miracles as if he were writing a myth.

Even the legendary Maestro Empress Karas returned to the stage because of Kang Hyun.

Undoubtedly, Kang Hyun had already become a force capable of shaking the classical music world with his name alone.

Saaa...

Dry ice descended onto the stage. It was an unexpected set piece.

Sergei, seated on the piano bench, took a deep breath. Wasn't this an unscheduled performance? It was the OST that ran through the entire ambitious project "Horror" by Director Jim Filmer.

-Hyun, it would be a great honor if you could play the OST of "Horror" at your New York concert.

Director Jim Filmer had come to the New York Philharmonic in person and said this in front of the orchestra members.

Jim Filmer, known as a master of Hollywood, had complete trust in Kang Hyun.

The proof was today's performance. The movie hadn't even been released, yet the OST that ran through its entirety was being performed on stage.

As Kang Hyun stepped onto the stage, the buzzing audience fell silent as if by magic.

His neat hair, large eyes without double eyelids, shone deeply like the sun's sunspots.

Sitting closest to the conductor, Sergei felt he understood why American teenagers were so enthusiastic about Hyun.

His musical talent was a given, but the mystique of his appearance was beyond words.

Especially on stage, Hyun exuded a charisma greater than any male actor and was more beautiful and noble than any actress. As if to say, this stage belonged to him.

At that moment,

Dudududung―!

The conductor's hand swiftly cut through the air. The sound of the large drum resonated like thunder, reaching the ceiling of the concert hall.

The conductor's hand holding the baton moved slowly, very slowly, as if cradling a baby.

Just as the thunderous drum sound began to echo and fade,

The conductor's gaze and the concertmaster's breath started simultaneously. The melody of the string section began to rise gently, starting with the violin part.

Sergei awaited his turn. When the rising melody engulfed the concert hall like a tidal wave, his long fingers began to dance on the keys.

Sergei's shoulders moved up and down like rough waves. His fingers dancing on the keys also sobbed without falling behind.

Sergei considered coming to New York one of the luckiest events of his life. More precisely, it was his praise for meeting the new world conductor named Kang Hyun at the New York Philharmonic.

Dudududung―!

Then, once again, the large drum's sound resonated with the conductor's gesture.

The highlight of the concert was now beginning. As the members grabbed their instruments with tense expressions, the baton descended sharply. It was a perfect metronome.

Sergei's piano and the numerous melodies of the members began to rise as if competing with each other.

It was Kang Hyun's role to conduct through the midst of it all.

Sergei was experiencing the same ecstasy he felt when playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2, known as the pinnacle of the Romantic era.

The score harmoniously expressed the competition and poignancy between the orchestra and the soloist. Even while performing, the score was so perfect that he couldn't help but be amazed once again.

If Rachmaninoff were alive, he would have surely applauded after seeing Hyun's score, saying it was remarkable.

* * *

Director Jim Filmer felt as if the entire plot of the movie was flashing through his mind while listening to the OST of "Horror."

As a film director, he knew how challenging it was to create a theme song that ran through the entire movie.

In that sense, Kang Hyun had undoubtedly created another movie.

"Amazing."

He couldn't help but be impressed. Who would've thought the New York performance would start with the OST of "Horror"?

The symphony, which had been the talk of the town since Kang Hyun became the music director, had also garnered significant interest from the audience.

How great a masterpiece must it have been to stir so much excitement in Hollywood? The audience's expectations had been sky-high.

But Hyun managed to send shivers down the audience's spines.

Even though the first act had ended, the audience's lingering excitement didn't easily fade.

Moreover, the next piece on the scheduled repertoire was "Gang Hyun Symphony No. 1," which was sweeping the Billboard charts.

Compared to commercial music, it was a long epic, but it proudly made it onto the Billboard chart.

"Buying a scalped ticket and being here today feels like a real stroke of luck."

"I agree. If I had missed Hyun's performance today, I would have regretted it for the rest of my life as a journalist."

Even the journalists couldn't hide their excitement. The same went for pop music critics. Even the critics who occasionally threw harsh words at Hyun were visibly overwhelmed by the first act.

Of course, even the legendary classical masters had lavished praise on Hyun's score.

"But is it really true?"

"You're talking about Gang Hyun Symphony No. 3 being included in the repertoire, right?"

"Yeah, I can't believe Symphony No. 3 is programmed instead of the second."

There were certainly surprising parts about the repertoire.

Instead of recycling works by great classical and Romantic era composers like Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, and Rachmaninoff, only Kang Hyun's symphonies were programmed.

The most notable part was "Gang Hyun Symphony No. 3."

-The second symphony is still unfinished.

Among the three symphonies, Hyun planned to present No. 1 and No. 3, excluding the unfinished No. 2. Experts predicted that the new symphony Hyun was unveiling also had a high chance of making it onto the Billboard chart.

At that moment, Kang Hyun, having finished the first act, gave a brief greeting from the stage.

"I would like to thank the audience for attending today's New York Philharmonic performance. The reason I am greeting you now before starting the next act is because the repertoire has been changed."

A change in the repertoire, but the orchestra members' eyes didn't show a hint of wavering, as if it were all planned.

"I will add the previously unfinished Gang Hyun Symphony No. 2 to the repertoire. Of course, we will still perform the originally planned pieces. I apologize for the extended performance time. Now, please enjoy the grand melodies of the New York Philharmonic."

At that moment, Director Jim Filmer realized. Hyun might appear blunt and cynical, but in reality, he was a brilliant conductor.

The sudden addition to the repertoire was clearly planned. Even the concertmaster's faint smile showed it.

There wasn't a single audience member complaining about the extended performance time. Instead, a deep excitement and anticipation filled the concert hall like waves.

At that moment, Maestro Hyun raised his hand again. With the audience's excited breaths, Hyun's time had arrived.
