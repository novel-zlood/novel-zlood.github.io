“South Korea is in chaos.”

The reason why Barbara Tannenbaum, the president of the Barbara Group, was interested in South Korea was simple. It was because it was Kang Hyun's homeland.

“Tanya, did you say there's a succession battle?”

“Yes, Ms. Barbara. After Chairman Son Jangwon, who had reigned as an absolute figure within the Jeil Group, collapsed, his first and second sons clashed over the successor position. Currently, the second son, Son Gangwook, seems to be in a more advantageous position.”

“No matter where you go, blood ties are useless in front of money. Wasn't the side connected to Hyun the eldest son?”

Tanya nodded briefly.

“That’s correct. Kang Hyun has a close relationship with the eldest son, Son Ilseon’s daughter. The woman you saw in the U.S. was Son Yooha, the daughter of President Son Ilseon.”

“Yes, they made a very well-matched couple.”

Barbara had seen the two in the garden of Juilliard School of Music and had even described their beauty as surpassing gold. However, at this rate, even their beautiful love seemed to be in danger of falling apart.

“What are the chances that President Son Ilseon's side will gain the upper hand in the succession structure?”

“Initially, the second son, Son Gangwook, was not well-known compared to the eldest son, Son Ilseon. However, it appears that he has been preparing a lot under the surface, showing that his capabilities are not inferior. Right after Chairman Son Jangwon collapsed, he acted as if he had been waiting for this moment, indicating that he had been sharpening his knife for a long time. I think even President Son Ilseon will not easily overcome this crisis.”

“Oh, is that so?”

How interesting. Barbara had initially not had much interest in Asian companies. However, she had already heard of the Jeil Group, a company looking beyond Asia to the world.

“What about Hyun’s movements?”

“According to the information obtained, he has temporarily halted his activities as a violinist and maestro and is living an ordinary college life. However, Kang Hyun has also been secretly contacting significant figures in the Korean business world. It seems he is trying to help President Son Ilseon.”

“Tanya, do you think Hyun can help President Son Ilseon?”

“As you know, Ms. Barbara, Kang Hyun is a mysterious figure. He has achieved inexplicable results not only in the Barbara Mining case but also in the investment industry. Moreover, President Son Ilseon is someone Kang Hyun has a definite reason to help. However, it is hard to judge how he will face Son Gangwook, who is fully prepared.”

Of course, as they say, the arm bends inward. It was natural for him to help the father of the woman he loved.

Barbara felt a bit disappointed. Even if Hyun had asked her for help, she would have supported him in every way. Yet, he hadn't contacted her at all.

Or maybe, it could be seen differently. It was the same as having the confidence to overcome this crisis on his own.

Considering all that Hyun had shown so far, hadn't he made the impossible possible?

“I’m curious.”

Barbara said, swirling her wine glass.

“About what will happen next.”

* * *

“What?”

I raised my voice unconsciously. To be engaged to his great-granddaughter.

“Why, do you dislike it?”

“Sir, I think it's too high a price to exchange for the residence of Master Deoksu. And your great-granddaughter might not like me.”

“What are you talking about? My great-granddaughter likes you very much. She owns all of Kang Hyun's albums, the violinist and maestro. She even flies to see your performances.”

Kim Namcheon’s face was firm. It was unbelievable. Not only had he refused billions, but he also offered an engagement in return. At that moment,

“Haha, your face is quite a sight.”

“Pardon?”

“I was just joking. But I didn't expect you to be so troubled. There are quite a few wealthy people who offer gold and silver treasures just to become a part of the Kim Namcheon family. Moreover, I was trying to pair you up with my most beloved great-granddaughter. Others would have cried tears of joy.”

Of course, wasn’t Kim Namcheon once called the king of the media in his youth? That nickname still held. Becoming a part of the Kim Namcheon family meant wielding immense power in Korea. However,

“Yes, you have Chairman Son's granddaughter. What a pity. If I had met you before Chairman Son, I would have marked you somehow. Sigh.”

I was about to show an embarrassed smile.

“You said you were curious about the residence of the Gwangyang White Whale?”

“Yes, sir.”

“I'll just tell you this time.”

It was an unexpected statement. But I couldn't help but be nervous. Kim Namcheon never made deals where he would incur a loss.

“The price is to come and chat with me whenever I want.”

“Chatting?”

“Yes, living in seclusion in the countryside at this age, there are many lonely times. Talking with a sharp young man like you is quite enjoyable. I will contact the Gwangyang White Whale and have him sent to Chairman Yoo’s residence in Pyeongchang-dong. That friend owes me, so he will probably comply.”

What an exceptional deal. Just chatting would allow me to meet the Gwangyang White Whale. Moreover, Kim Namcheon said he would personally send the Gwangyang White Whale to the house in Pyeongchang-dong. Just as my tea cup was emptied,

“Sir, may I ask you one more thing?”

“You are a very greedy friend. No one has asked me so many questions until now. Go ahead.”

“What are the odds that Son Gangwook will win the Jeil Group succession battle?”

Kim Namcheon smiled faintly, as if he had expected the question.

“Forty percent.”

[Anonymous reports related to accounting fraud at Jeil Electronics are flooding the prosecution. These reports have been distributed not only to the prosecution but also to various media outlets. In response, current Jeil Electronics President Son Gangwook has declared that he will do everything in his power to severely punish those involved in the accounting fraud.]

The news was filled with stories about the Jeil Group.

There were so many things that didn’t make sense. Why on earth had the future changed?

I couldn’t focus on my music work due to my troubled mind.

‘What changed from the past life?’

They often talk about the butterfly effect. I had achieved musical fame, which was different from my past life. Moreover, I had formed connections with world-renowned figures and even Barbara, the president of an American group.

Crucially,

‘Chairman Wang didn't step down.’

In my past life, Chairman Wang had retired as we entered the millennium.

But this life was different. His will to manage was firm. His health was also remarkably better compared to when he decided to retire in the past life.

‘Why did Chairman Wang decide to retire in the past life?’

Chairman Wang had retired in 2000. He passed away within five years of his retirement, so he had held managerial power for a long time in the business world.

However, this life was different. As I pondered the reason for the difference between the past life and this life,

Could it be?

A hypothesis crossed my mind.

“Grandfather.”

In the past life’s history, my grandfather passed away in 1999. I was a senior in high school at the time and had never met him.

My exam preparations were more important than my grandfather’s passing, so I was a disrespectful grandson who didn’t even sit for thirty minutes at the funeral. Now it seemed the puzzle pieces were falling into place.

“Chairman Wang retired because of my grandfather.”

Chairman Wang’s decision to retire was because of my grandfather’s death. But the current history had changed drastically.

My grandfather had recovered his health and continued to manage as chairman of Dongju.

As a result, Chairman Wang also had no intention of stepping down from his position at the Jeil Group.

This ultimately led to the emergence of the second son, Son Gangwook. As all the puzzle pieces fit together, I felt like a splash of cold water hit my head.

* * *

My mind was filled with thoughts. It was hard to accept that all these events were a result of my own actions.

To clear my head, I sat at my desk and began to write music scores.

As the notes filled the staff, I began to feel a sense of peace.

By the time dawn had passed and morning arrived, I couldn't attend breakfast. I couldn't face my grandfather.

Splash.

I washed my face. The flowing water seemed to wash away my thoughts. How much time had passed?

“Kang Hyun, you have a guest.”

The housekeeper called for me early in the morning.

It wasn’t long after my grandfather and father had left for work. I never imagined a guest would come at this hour.

I took off the towel around my neck and went downstairs.

“Are you Kang Hyun?”

A middle-aged man in ordinary attire stood there. But his eyes were not ordinary. The eyes behind the rimless glasses shone sharply like a gladiator in the Colosseum.

I felt this way when facing hardcore criminals in the Western Prosecutor’s Office in my past life. Despite not having slept a wink, I felt wide awake.

“Were you looking for me?”

“Yes?”

“I got a call from Mr. Kim Namcheon to go to Pyeongchang-dong.”

My Adam’s apple bobbed.

“Are you Master Deoksu?”

“You know my name well. Most people call me the Gwangyang White Whale. Yes, I am Master Deoksu. If I didn’t owe Mr. Kim Namcheon, I wouldn’t have come to see you. What do you want to ask me?”

There were countless things I wanted to ask. How he was related to Chairman Wang, why Chairman Wang wanted me to find him, and more. But seeing Master Deoksu’s appearance, I felt curious.

“Excuse me, but are you really Master Deoksu?”

“Yes, I am.”

“Do you know Chairman Son Jangwon?”

Master Deoksu nodded as if it was obvious.

“Of course, I know him well.”

“Really?”

“Yes, who in Korea doesn’t know Chairman Son Jangwon of the Jeil Group? I heard he’s bedridden? That’s why Korea is so noisy. Even in my secluded mountain, I can hear about it. Probably even the homeless at Seoul Station know.”

I couldn’t understand. According to my grandfather, Master Deoksu was like a mentor to Chairman Wang.

But now, he was speaking as if he was dealing with a stranger. Not only that,

“Excuse me, but how old are you this year?”

“You ask a lot of questions for a first meeting. I am sixty-one this year.”

He was too young.
