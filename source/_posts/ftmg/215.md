Royal Music School Concert.

This concert is a tradition and pride of the Royal Music School, boasting a long history.

Isn't it a school where musical geniuses from all over the world gather, not just from the UK? It was a place where they could freely showcase their skills.

In the past, celebrities would donate to see this concert, and professors from music schools in other countries would come to observe. However...

"This is all the applications we received this year...?"

The wrinkled eyes were full of concern.

It was reasonable since the number of students applying to participate in the Royal Music School concert was noticeably decreasing year by year.

The reason was simple. The level of the concert had risen so much that it was impossible to participate without considerable confidence, and most students were focusing more on competitions than the school's concert.

"In the past, even if they lacked skill, they didn't hesitate to stand on stage..."

The wrinkled eyes were reminiscing about the past. In the past, they enjoyed the concert like a festival, regardless of their skill level.

But at some point, only the top students of the Royal Music School participated.

Moreover, the participating students had developed an excessive sense of competition, feeling the need to defeat each other.

"Mr. Dixon, but it's true that the level of the concert has risen compared to the past. Although the number of participating students has decreased, the reputation of the Royal Music School concert hasn't diminished. So don't be too sad."

It was Bailey sitting opposite. She was also a staff member of the Royal Music School like Dixon.

"Then let's finalize the applications for this year."

It was at that moment.

Knock, knock.

With the sound of a knock, the door to the staff room was slowly opening.

"Tommy?"

Bailey, recognizing a familiar face, asked curiously.

The one who entered was Tommy, an undergraduate majoring in cello, his face full of freckles. Tommy, who was sociable, was well-known among the staff.

"Tommy, what brings you here at this hour?"

"Um, I'm here to submit my application for the concert."

"For the concert?"

It was unexpected. Bailey thought Tommy was far from being a concert participant.

Wasn't it a concert with such a high level that even undergraduates with exceptional musical talent hesitated to participate?

Tommy was a child who always doubted his musical talent. Afraid of embarrassing himself, he kept his distance from the concert.

At that moment, Bailey and Dixon's eyes widened as they saw two people walking in with Tommy.

"Sabrina...?"

The White Witch, known by everyone working at the Royal Music School, and...

"Hyun!"

A person who was currently stirring up the Royal Music School.

* * *

The trigger was pulled.

After submitting his application for the concert, Tommy was continuously regretting.

He couldn't understand why Kang Hyun and Sabrina had chosen him for their trio.

Moreover, a trio with a violin and cello, excluding the piano for a trio.

"Sabrina, Tommy. Could you take a look at this sheet music?"

Kang Hyun handed the sheet music he had composed to Sabrina and Tommy.

Sabrina's turquoise eyes gradually filled with interest as she skimmed through the sheet music.

Tommy's jaw dropped as soon as he received the sheet music. Then he looked at Kang Hyun as if he were looking at a ghost.

'I could never compose a piece like this even if I were reborn.'

The sheet music seemed to be a blend of the most necessary inspirations, imagination, and techniques for composition.

The beauty of the piece, not to mention its difficulty, was beyond words. But Sabrina, after frowning in thought, soon picked up a red pen like Kang Hyun.

"Hyun, I think this part should be changed. If we play it as it is, one of us will definitely cause a problem. It would be better to connect it smoothly like this."

"I was also considering that part. But I'm not sure how our skills will improve before the concert. I'll keep it in mind, Sabrina."

Groan.

Tommy unconsciously licked his dry lips. He knew that Sabrina was referring to him as one of the three.

In the end, Tommy swallowed hard, as if making a decision, and looked at the two.

"Hyun, Sabrina."

"Yes?"

"Can I drop out now? No matter how much I think about it, my understanding of the piece is low compared to you two, and my playing skills can't keep up. If this continues, I'll only be a burden to your ensemble..."

Tommy lowered his gaze as he finished speaking. His eyes were swirling with various emotions, including self-reproach.

It was no wonder, as being with the two often left him amazed at their boundless musical talents.

At first, he had the desire to learn music from them without feeling despair. But as time passed, that desire was fading.

At that moment.

"No."

Sabrina firmly shook her head. Tommy looked up with wide eyes at Sabrina, not expecting her to speak so decisively.

"Why not...?"

"Because you are our only audience. So you must stay with us."

Sabrina was saying something incomprehensible. Kang Hyun added while looking at Tommy.

"Tommy, I believe in you. If you didn't have the ability to handle this sheet music, I wouldn't have chosen you in the first place. But you definitely have the talent to understand and perform this piece on the cello."

"Hyun, even if you say that, I don't have the skills to play this sheet music smoothly right now..."

"If your skills are lacking, it doesn't matter."

At that moment, Kang Hyun smiled and said.

"Because we can practice from now on."

Tommy felt an indescribable chill from Kang Hyun's smile.

* * *

"Sabrina participated?"

There was a strange rumor circulating at the Royal Music School. It was said that Sabrina, known as the White Witch, had applied to participate in the Royal Music School concert.

Most undergraduates didn't believe it. Sabrina was known to avoid appearing in front of others.

Moreover, the rumor said she was participating with Kang Hyun.

"They say they're coming out as a trio with an undergraduate cellist named Tommy?"

"What? A trio?!"

"But does anyone know who this Tommy is?"

"Isn't he the freckled kid who always gets scolded by Professor Albert in the cello practice room?"

The murmur among the undergraduates was growing louder. Their curiosity was all directed at Tommy.

While it was somewhat understandable for Sabrina and Kang Hyun to perform together, as both were considered geniuses in music,

Tommy's presence seemed almost colorless and odorless compared to the two.

"If it's true, I could take the cello part."

"That's right, I'd welcome being in a trio with Hyun and Sabrina with open arms!"

"Why Tommy? He isn't that famous. Hasn't he never won any awards in competitions?"

Tommy lowered his head even more in the cafeteria. Others were belittling and disparaging him, but he didn't have the confidence to retort.

They weren't wrong. In fact, he was afraid others would see his freckles. At that moment.

"Tommy, you're about to dip your nose into the soup."

Kang Hyun sat next to Tommy. Sabrina, who appeared out of nowhere, took a seat across from Tommy.

For a moment, the cafeteria fell silent.

Sabrina stood up and looked at the students who had just belittled Tommy.

"You guys aren't any better than Tommy in playing. I've been listening to students' performances at the Royal Music School for a long time, but there were very few cello melodies that satisfied my ears. One of those few is Tommy."

Although her words were brief, the students' faces turned red in an instant.

Aren't they all students of the Royal Music School, holding supreme pride in their music?

But given the opponent, no one dared to speak first.

"Hyun, what do you think?"

Sabrina nodded towards Kang Hyun. The attention of the crowd quickly shifted to him.

Kang Hyun, munching on a French fry, nonchalantly added briefly.

"I agree."

* * *

'Are they really human...?'

Tommy thought as he watched Kang Hyun and Sabrina. It had been a week since they started staying in the practice room together.

With each passing day, Tommy was left speechless by their performances. Their talent and skills were so immense that Tommy couldn't even imagine.

Growl.

At that moment, a rumbling sound came from Tommy's stomach. Kang Hyun smiled as he looked at the sheet music.

"Sabrina, it seems we need to have dinner."

"I'd like to practice a bit more. I haven't mastered this part yet."

"I-I'll get some sandwichesâ€•!"

Tommy quickly stood up as if he had been waiting for this moment.

Since they were practicing an important part of the violin ensemble, he couldn't disturb them any longer.

Kang Hyun and Sabrina nodded willingly, and Tommy swiftly left the practice room.

'Whew.'

His legs were trembling. Hadn't he been playing the cello for more than half a day? His legs, which were supporting the cello, felt as heavy as a thousand pounds.

Of course, they had been pushing themselves for days now. His stomach was growling like a big drum, a testament to their grueling routine.

At that moment.

"Tommy?"

It was Professor Albert. Having discovered Tommy on his way to the cafeteria from the practice room, Professor Albert approached him with uncharacteristically quick steps.

"Is it true that you're participating in the concert with Hyun and Sabrina?"

"Yes, Professor."

"Really?"

Professor Albert looked at Tommy with a complex expression.

It was as if he couldn't understand how Tommy could join that group. It wasn't to belittle Tommy but out of pure curiosity.

How did he manage to break through the ironclad heart of Sabrina and gain the favor of Kang Hyun, who was recognized by many maestros as a musical genius?

"Tommy, don't miss this opportunity."

"Excuse me?"

"It's an opportunity that may never come again in your life, an opportunity to break through your musical limits. I don't know why those two chose you, but seize and indulge in their talents."

Professor Albert gave a brief piece of advice and then turned away. Tommy knew that Professor Albert cared about him.

After all, hadn't he been his mentor for years since he entered the Royal Music School?

Buzz.

Returning with sandwiches, Tommy found Kang Hyun and Sabrina already engrossed in their performance as if they had forgotten everything.

The two violins played as if they were singing to each other.

Just listening to it sent shivers down his spine.

'Seize and indulge in their talents.'

At that moment, Professor Albert's advice naturally popped into his mind.
