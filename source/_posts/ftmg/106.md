"Father―!"

The mansion in Ichon-dong was noisy from the morning. The reason was simple. It was because the younger uncle, who had been exiled to Jeju Island, had come back.

I heard he came to Seoul Hospital to treat his diabetes, but he doesn't look like a sick person at all; in fact, he looks quite healthy.

"Please forgive me just this once."

His face is so sleek, it’s obvious he’s been eating three meals a day without missing any.

If I had known this would happen, I should have suggested to Grandfather to send him to an uninhabited island instead of Jeju Island.

Grandfather looked down at the younger uncle, who was kneeling, with a chilling gaze.

"Beomkyung, do you realize that it has only been a year since you were sent to Jeju Island?"

"Father, you said it was a year, but to me, it felt like ten years. I can't tell you how much I've reflected during that time. I still can't forget that day's mistake and suffer from nightmares. Please, can you not forgive me just this once?"

I was so taken aback that I couldn't say a word. It was clear that he had lost his nerve as the scar on his forehead healed.

But on the other hand, I could also understand the urgency of the younger uncle.

In a time when large corporations were collapsing like autumn leaves, and small and big companies in Korea were going bankrupt like dominoes, Dongju was stronger than ever. It was like a fortress.

'Tsk.'

He must have thought that if things continued as they were, he might lose everything from Dongju. It was because my father's influence within Dongju was gradually increasing. Especially after recruiting Dr. Tikhonov's team, he had established himself as a practical power. It was then.

"Father, I wasn't just idling away on the island. I made many business proposals, determined to return to the mainland one day."

The younger uncle started taking out something from his briefcase.

"I've identified companies that Dongju could merge with among the currently unstable companies. I believe now is the perfect time to expand our business while Korea is in crisis. Father―!"

"Father, this time Beomkyung is right. Although considering his past mistakes, it wouldn't be enough to beat him to death, this time he seems to have truly changed his mind, so I brought him to Ichon-dong. I also believe that now is the time we can significantly expand Dongju at a low cost."

It felt like watching Dumb and Dumber. The older uncle knelt next to the younger uncle.

Now I slowly began to understand their thoughts.

Currently, Dongju was at a stage where it was solidifying its internal structure. The main pillars of this were Graphene and my father.

Weren't these the two who initially opposed the development of new materials? Now that they can't change their stance, they plan to expand the company. The bigger the pie, the more they can take. However.

'Indeed.'

Many companies were struggling with debt. From a foreign perspective, Korea might seem like it's having a grand bargain sale.

But could the uncles identify companies with future growth potential?

Could they find them faster than foreign corporate raiders? No, the possibility of that was less likely than a neighbor’s dog walking on two legs and speaking human language. Moreover.

"Hyun, go to your room now."

Grandfather's hand, holding the documents, was trembling. His tiger-like eyes turned directly to the nearby furniture.

As I was going upstairs, I heard two loud thuds followed by the sound of two foreheads hitting the floor.

"Those rascals thought they were smart, huh?"

Chairman Wang chuckled and picked up his teacup. The story he heard from his close friend was as entertaining as any drama.

The time for hearty laughter to offend each other's feelings was long gone. Hadn't they known each other for decades, through thick and thin?

"It seems like Beomjin and Beomkyung are not like you, old man. How could they be so transparent?"

In business, it was crucial for a manager not to reveal their intentions. Whether it was a mild spring day or a cold winter day with a north wind blowing, maintaining composure was essential.

In that sense, Chairman Yoo's two sons were failing. Worried about their diminishing influence within the company, they were making rash moves.

"They must have been anxious. Kang is doing so well. How is Kang's position within Dongju now?"

"Don't even get me started. Honestly, I want to kick everyone out and make Kang my son. Except for the executives aligned with Beomjin, everyone supports Kang. But you know, in this field, someone who smells like a human is a double-edged sword. Kang's nature is too kind, so I'm a bit worried."

Chairman Wang nodded understandingly.

In the seat of management, there were times when one had to make decisions that others couldn't. Sometimes, one needed to be cunning and cold-hearted.

"In that sense, Hyun is perfect. By the way, can I see the list of companies Beomkyung made?"

Chairman Yoo handed over the documents, and Chairman Wang slowly read through them. As expected of the joint effort of Beomjin and Beomkyung, there were significant efforts to persuade Chairman Yoo.

But the result was sloppy. If there had been any companies worth noting, others would have already taken them.

"Did Hyun see this document too?"

"I showed it to him."

"What did he say?"

Chairman Wang was curious about Kang Hyun's evaluation. Hadn't he seen the boy’s foresight every weekend during their Go games? He looked forward to Kang Hyun’s comments on the document.

"He said the younger uncle was acting like a child."

"A child?"

"He said it was like a kid picking up anything that looks tasty and then getting a stomachache."

Chairman Wang laughed heartily again at Kang Hyun's analogy. It was indeed an excellent metaphor.

"By the way, Son, isn’t Seonye’s wedding soon?"

"That's actually why I called you. Here, take this."

Chairman Yoo handed over a pure white invitation and brushed his dry lips.

"I don't know why I couldn't do like you."

"Don't blame yourself. In the past, I wouldn't have been different from you. They say no one can win against time or their children. Given the current situation, we plan to have a small family gathering. Join us for a simple meal with Hyun."

Chairman Yoo slowly nodded, his gaze still fixed on the invitation.

"The stage I want to perform on the most."

Baek Junghoon answered without hesitation to the TV show host's question.

"It would be Carnegie Hall, right?"

Carnegie Hall in New York, the ideal place for musicians. Especially, the Isaac Stern Auditorium symbolizes Carnegie Hall, a dream venue for anyone.

Unfortunately, it was a place Baek Junghoon hadn't yet had the chance to perform at.

"Baek Junghoon, if you had to pick an orchestra to collaborate with, which would it be?"

"That's a tough question. The world's leading philharmonic orchestras are beyond my reach. Maybe that's why I keep studying music abroad. I can't just be a frog in a well."

When the camera zoomed in on Baek Junghoon's face, the audience erupted in cheers.

The audience had a noticeably high number of female fans. As he aged, Baek Junghoon's features became more pronounced, and people started calling him the Terius of the pianist world. He had popularity that rivaled many male singers and sports stars.

"I understand that all your performances have just ended. What are your future plans? Are you planning to study abroad in Europe again?"

"No, I plan to stay in Korea for a while."

"Does that mean we can expect additional performances in Korea?"

Baek Junghoon shook his head briefly.

Despite the host and camera's persistent focus on his mouth, no further words came out.

It was still unknown that Baek Junghoon had accompanied Kang Hyun's recital.

It was a marketing strategy by Director Im Hyera to gradually reveal attention-grabbing information.

The host brushed his lips in regret.

"Baek Junghoon, you are so talented as a pianist that you are called the next great master. Have you ever envied someone else's talent? For example, have you ever thought, 'This person might surpass me?' Although I doubt it."

"No, I have."

The host's eyes widened in surprise. He hadn't expected such an answer to what was meant as a light-hearted question.

Baek Junghoon paused theatrically and looked at the camera. To be exact.

"If it were another field, I would have just looked at it with admiration. But when that person played the piano, I realized something. Ah, the god of music really exists. Otherwise, how could one person have so much talent?"

Beyond the camera, to that person.

"So it was around this time."

It was a modest wedding. It was unusually quiet for a chaebol family wedding.

Although the times were chaotic, only close relatives gathered in a small church, making it seem like a wartime wedding.

"Oppa―!"

Son Yooha appeared and linked her arm with mine. Grandfather looked at us with a pleased expression. At that moment, Son Yooha started leading me somewhere.

"Let's go greet my aunt, Oppa."

Son Yooha led me to the bridal room.

There, a woman I knew from a previous life was sitting in a white wedding dress. Although it was from a past life.

"Aunt, you look so beautiful!"

"Oh my, Yooha is here. Yooha, you look more like your mom and prettier every day. And the gentleman next to you is?"

"Hello, I'm Kang Hyun."

I bowed politely.

She was the eldest daughter of the Jeil Group and the first daughter of Chairman Wang. In my past life, I had met Director Im Hyera a few times, but she was a woman etched clearly in my memory.

A woman born into a chaebol family but not like one at all. In some ways, she was similar to my mother. She chose love over her golden spoon.

The difference was.

"Chairman Wang's decision."

Chairman Wang allowed his eldest daughter's love. Unlike the youngest, who inherited a department store, she had nothing, but today she looked happier than ever.

"Ah, so you're the boyfriend Yooha mentioned? You're very handsome. Yooha takes after me in her taste in men."

She seemed to get along well with Son Yooha. However, she kept studying my face with a puzzled expression.

Before long, the wedding began. It was a warm wedding, perhaps because there were few guests.

The reason Chairman Wang did not invite guests was to consider his son-in-law, who was from an ordinary background far from the business world.

During the beautiful wedding song, I held Grandfather's hand. His wrinkled hand held many thoughts.

The wedding atmosphere was warm. It was a joyous occasion since Chairman Wang had already approved the marriage and it was decided that the eldest daughter would step down from management.

"I finally realized, you're the violinist Hyun, right? My husband is a big fan."

It was during the meal after the wedding. The bride, Son Seonye, finally recognized me and clapped her hands.

She then brought her husband, who was wearing a hanbok, to introduce him to me. He had a calm and gentle appearance.

"I'm a big fan, violinist Hyun."

The groom shook my hand and bowed his head, so I also bowed deeply. Grandfather, watching, subtly spoke to me.

"Instead of that, Hyun, how about performing a congratulatory song here? To celebrate the new couple's fresh start."

"A congratulatory song?"

Of course, he meant a violin performance. Although I thought Grandfather's voice was quite low, the groom was already swallowing and looking at me.

However, finding a violin right now would be difficult. At that moment, I noticed a piano on the stage.
