"Who's your favorite musician?"

I expected names like Mozart, Beethoven, or Brahms to be mentioned. After all, there were numerous renowned musicians etched in history.

How many brilliant names of composers from the Classical and Romantic eras are there?

"Kang Hyun oppa―!"

"Huh?"

"I like Hyun oppa the most. I was incredibly moved at his solo concert. I’m waiting every day for Hyun oppa’s album to be released."

It was a TV program searching for musical prodigies. Baek Jeonghun took on the role of a mentor and met students who were new to classical music, and surprisingly, none of them mentioned anyone other than Kang Hyun as their favorite musician.

Especially among the female students, his popularity was comparable to that of Seo Taiji and Boys.

"Hyejeong, would you like to try playing from the second movement again? I'll demonstrate for you. In this part, you have to press the keys deeply as if your fingers are bouncing; that's how you get a good legato. It's because your hands haven't grown fully yet, so it will get better with time."

Initially, he had reluctantly joined the program due to Im Hyera’s influence, but as time went on, he grew quite fond of it.

He hadn't realized how meaningful it was to teach someone as opposed to always practicing alone.

As always, the end of the shoot involved a one-on-one interview with the producer.

"Jeonghun, how was it?"

"Honestly, I never imagined there would be so many talented students in Korea. Some of them play the piano better than I did when I was young. If these kids continue to grow, in ten or twenty years, the classical music scene in Korea will be truly remarkable."

He wasn't just saying this for the sake of it. Thanks to Kang Hyun, hadn’t there been a noticeable increase in students aspiring to pursue classical music? Among them were many children whose talents surprised even Baek Jeonghun.

"Jeonghun, this question is off the record. There's a rumor that Kang Hyun went to the UK. Is it really for a royal performance?"

He didn't know where the rumor had leaked from, but the producer's face was filled with curiosity.

And rightly so, because if the news that Kang Hyun was performing for the British royal family got out, it would be a huge scoop, and the producer couldn’t help but be eager.

Moreover, contrary to everyone's expectations, wasn't he standing on stage not as a violinist but as a conductor? If this fact got out, the classical music world would be buzzing again.

As Baek Jeonghun remained silent, the producer's eyes grew even more excited and curious.

"One last question. Jeonghun, I think you've seen many musicians so far. For instance, you must have seen many young students like today. You were particularly impressed by Kim Hyejeong's piano performance today. Among all the people you've seen, who do you think is the most talented?"

"The most talented…"

Countless children he had met while filming the TV program flashed through Baek Jeonghun's mind. But if he had to name the most talented person, without a doubt, there would only be one.

He still couldn't forget the look in the eyes of the person who watched him make a mistake during a wedding performance. Even with his skills, he couldn't measure that person's talent. It was as deep and vast as the Pacific Ocean.

"Kang Hyun."

* * *

"Young master, Mr. Hyun is here."

The old butler's voice made Soo get up from his seat with a half-smile. The butler was only grateful to Kang Hyun. Wasn’t he the one who had taken care of Soo, replacing the nanny since childhood?

Soo, who was sensitive and prickly, seemed to be returning to his gentle nature after meeting Kang Hyun, which made the butler incredibly happy.

'Hyun.'

Kang Hyun was not an ordinary person either. The butler, who had been with the Geumwang Group family for many years, had seen countless people, but he had never seen such a mysterious boy.

On the outside, he seemed like a delicate and tender boy, but inside, he was stronger than anyone. When conversing with him, one could even feel an inexplicable sense of maturity.

"Soo, why did you call me?"

Kang Hyun asked curiously. It was understandable since he had previously warned that he wouldn't be able to tutor for a while, and now he was contacted so suddenly.

"Isn't today your day off?"

"To be precise, it’s a day to catch my breath. If I cling to the symphony all week, I'll get tense and make mistakes. By the way, you even know my schedule?"

"I asked Chrissy. Since there's not much time left until the royal performance, wouldn't you need to get your clothes fitted? You can't go up on such a grand stage wearing just anything."

Kang Hyun inadvertently questioned. Even though all the auditions weren’t over yet, Soo was convinced that Kang Hyun would stand on the royal stage. Just then, Soo smiled faintly as if he had read Kang Hyun’s mind.

"Who else but you could go up?"

"Pardon?"

"We don’t have much time; let’s move. I’d like to call a tailor to the mansion, but that old man is so stubborn. He can’t be swayed by money. Let’s get ready to go."

With Soo's words, the people in the mansion moved in perfect harmony. Kang Hyun, who had just arrived at the mansion, found himself having to leave again.

Wangchun sat in the driver's seat, and Chrissy sat in the passenger seat. Naturally, the back seat was occupied by Kang Hyun and Soo.

How long had the car been driving since it left the mansion? It arrived in front of an old shop located in a secluded alley in the city. It was an old shop with no signboard.

"It may look like this on the outside, but inside, it’s the best in London."

Soo wasn’t wrong. Upon entering the shop, they saw many mannequins, each dressed in tuxedos and suits that immediately caught Kang Hyun’s eye. Soon, a hunched old man walked out to greet Soo.

"Is this the friend you mentioned, young master?"

"Yes, old man."

"Hoho, they look much younger than I expected. But if the young master has taken them as a friend, they must be extraordinary."

The old man skillfully measured Kang Hyun’s body. He not only measured the length with a tape measure but also matched the fabric to his skin tone seamlessly.

A conductor's attire varies. Sometimes they wear custom suits, and other times they wear just a black shirt. However, in formal settings, they often wear a tailcoat, which is black in the back and white in the front, like a penguin.

"Let's try them on."

Kang Hyun felt like he had become a Barbie doll. At Soo's words, the old man immediately brought several samples.

When playing as a violinist, a custom suit was enough. But as a conductor who represents the orchestra, it was different. Kang Hyun stood in front of the mirror, wearing the clothes, looking somewhat awkward.

"Hyun, look at me."

Soo directly adjusted Kang Hyun’s attire. He skillfully fixed the crooked bow tie. It was a kindness he hadn't even received from his wife in his past life. Feeling awkward with this kindness, he almost coughed.

"In China, there's a tradition where a disciple gifts clothes to their teacher. I hope you wear the clothes I gift you and present a more splendid performance."

At that moment, the faces of Soo and Hyun were reflected in the mirror.

* * *

"Chrissy, today is the 17th, right?"

It was strange. Wasn’t there a line of spectators at the London Symphony Concert Hall, where the audition was scheduled to take place? Chrissy glanced at the rearview mirror and confirmed it was indeed the 17th. Could I have been mistaken? I was sure it was a closed audition.

"Are there spectators?"

Maestro Spencer's statement made Miles and Matthew's eyes widen. They never expected there to be an audience at the audition.

"Why are you so surprised? Even at international competitions, the final round includes an audience. Just think of it as the same arrangement."

"Maestro, how's the order?"

"I was just about to draw lots."

The result of the draw was that Miles went first and I was last. Miles's face was filled with unease. Understandably, going first always comes with nervousness and anxiety. As the audience continued to fill the concert hall seats, Matthew was refining his fundamentals.

"It feels more nerve-wracking than the finals of an international competition."

"I agree. I heard that the audience isn't just ordinary people. It seems Maestro personally invited musicians from London."

No wonder their eyes were so sharp. After all, wasn't this about selecting the conductor for a performance representing the British royal family? It wasn’t just Maestro's gaze they had to win over, but the eyes of all the musicians in London.

At that moment, Matthew's eyes sparkled as he looked at me. More precisely, at the baton in my hand.

"Is that made from an olive tree?"

I had a special baton from the German shop 'Fate of the Deer,' but I decided to save it for later.

It was actually a branch from an olive tree in my garden, sanded down, with a champagne cork as the handle. It wasn’t a particularly unique baton. But if asked why I used it, I would say it was because it was the second gift my disciple made for me, and I wanted to use it.

"Miles, you're up―!"

Just then, the first conductor was called.

* * *

Spencer looked down at the stage. The audience was filled with prominent figures from the classical music scene in England. Alongside musicians, there were also journalists from music magazines, each occupying a seat. It was only natural since they would be selecting the new face of the London Symphony. Spencer's shoulder issue was already widely known.

Unexpectedly, next to Spencer sat Soo from China. It was a surprise. No one expected the famously prideful Soo to personally attend this event. Miles from the U.S. and Matthew from Europe both took the stage in succession.

Both of them delivered flawless performances. As rising stars known as the next-generation maestros, their sharp baton movements created melodies that thrilled the audience. Spencer had a sudden thought.

"Soo, what do you think?"

"If you’re asking about the two preceding them, they handled the stage excellently. Although it was the same piece, they offered completely different interpretations. They seem to have the capabilities to succeed in any orchestra."

"Indeed, especially Matthew was quite surprising. I never imagined he would interpret the transition between movements that way. I can almost hear other orchestra representatives salivating."

He wasn't wrong. Miles and Matthew were both conductors that any orchestra would covet.

Especially because these incredibly talented individuals, with years of experience and depth, could one day become conductors representing an entire nation.

"Soo, isn’t it a pity?"

"If you mean the royal performance, I don’t think it’s a pity at all."

"Then, what do you think of the last participant, Hyun?"

Soo thought of Kang Hyun. His pale eyes grew warm, and his cheek twitched with the memory of Kang Hyun. Among all the musicians he had met, Kang Hyun had etched the most captivating and brilliant musical ideas into his mind.

Like an imaginary ancient tree bearing countless fruits, Kang Hyun's talent was multifaceted. Not only with the violin but also in piano, composition, and conducting.

Even one of these talents would be enough to shake the classical music world. Kang Hyun's talent had blossomed in various fields. Looking at his scores evoked not just surprise, but reverence.

"Miles and Matthew are outstanding conductors. As someone who studied music with them, I know how talented and hardworking they are. They will definitely become maestros leading the world's orchestras in the future. However."

"However?"

Individually, they are conductors worthy of standing on the royal stage with the London Symphony. But Soo evaluated Kang Hyun as “the young maestro who moves the world.”

"They met the wrong opponent."
