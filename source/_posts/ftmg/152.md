"Who is your favorite musician?"

I expected names like Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms to be mentioned. After all, countless renowned musicians are etched in history.

How many brilliant names of composers who illuminated the Classical and Romantic eras are there?

"Kang Hyun oppa―!"

"Huh?"

"I like Hyun oppa the most. I was incredibly moved at his solo concert. Even now, I wait every day for his album to be released."

It was a TV program searching for musical prodigies. Baek Junghoon served as a mentor, meeting students who were new to classical music, and almost unanimously, the name Kang Hyun was mentioned as their favorite musician.

Especially among the female students, his popularity was comparable to Seo Taiji and Boys.

"Hyejeong, can you play from the second movement again? I'll show you as an example. In this part, you need to press the keys deeply as if your fingers are bouncing to achieve good legato. It's because your hands haven't fully grown yet, so it will be resolved as time passes."

Initially, he was reluctant to join the program due to Im Hyera's influence, but over time, he grew quite fond of it.

He hadn't realized back then how meaningful it was to teach someone, rather than always practicing alone.

As always, the end of the filming included a one-on-one interview with the director.

"Junghoon, how was it?"

"Honestly, I never imagined there would be so many talented students in Korea. There were even students who played the piano better than I did when I was young. If these children continue to grow like this, I have high hopes for the Korean classical scene in ten or twenty years."

It wasn't just a lip service. Maybe it was thanks to Kang Hyun, but the number of students aspiring to classical music had noticeably increased. Among them, there were several students whose talents astonished even Baek Junghoon.

"Junghoon, this next question is off the record. There's a rumor that Kang Hyun went to the UK for a royal performance. Is that true?"

The director's face was full of curiosity, as it would be a big scoop if it were true. After all, if it's revealed that Kang Hyun would perform for the British Royal Family, it would be a major exclusive.

Moreover, contrary to everyone's expectations, he wasn't going to perform as a violinist but as a conductor. If this fact were revealed, it would stir the classical music world once again.

When Baek Junghoon consistently refrained from commenting, the director's eyes filled with even more excitement and curiosity.

"Last question. I believe you have seen many musicians so far. For example, you must have seen many young students like today. You were particularly impressed by Kim Hyejeong's piano performance today. Among those you've seen, who do you think is the most talented?"

"The most talented..."

Countless children he met while filming the TV program passed through Baek Junghoon's mind. But if he had to name the most talented person, there would be only one, without a doubt.

He could never forget the eyes that looked at him when he made a mistake during a wedding performance. Even with his abilities, he couldn't measure that child's talent. It was as deep and vast as the Pacific Ocean.

"It's Kang Hyun."

* * *

"Young master, Mr. Hyun is here."

Soo stood up at the voice of the old butler. The butler was nothing but grateful to Kang Hyun. He had taken care of Soo in place of a nanny since childhood.

Soo, who was sensitive and prickly, seemed to gradually return to the gentle nature of his childhood after meeting Kang Hyun, which made the butler immensely happy.

'Hyun.'

Kang Hyun was not an ordinary person either. The butler, having been with the Geumwang Group family for many years, had seen countless people, but never someone as mysterious as Kang Hyun.

On the outside, he appeared to be a delicate and graceful boy, but inside, he was stronger than anyone. One could even feel an inexplicable sense of maturity when conversing with him.

"Soo, why did you call me?"

Kang Hyun asked curiously. It was understandable since he had been warned that he wouldn't be able to tutor for a while, and yet Soo contacted him so soon.

"Wasn't today your day off?"

"To be precise, it's a day to catch my breath. If I cling to the symphony all week, I might make mistakes due to tension. By the way, how do you know my schedule?"

"I asked Chrissy. We don't have much time left until the royal performance, so we need to get your outfits ready. You can't just wear anything on such a grand stage."

Kang Hyun unconsciously asked back. Despite the auditions not being over yet, Soo was certain that Kang Hyun would be performing at the royal event. As if reading Kang Hyun's thoughts, Soo gave a faint smile.

"If not you, then who else can perform?"

"Pardon?"

"We don't have much time, so let's move. I'd like to call the tailor to the mansion, but the old man is quite stubborn. He's not someone who can be swayed by money. Let's get ready to leave."

At Soo's words, everyone in the mansion moved in perfect unison. Kang Hyun found himself having to leave the mansion right after arriving.

Wang Chun was in the driver's seat, and Chrissy in the passenger seat, leaving the back seat for Kang Hyun and Soo.

How long had the car been driving after leaving the mansion? They arrived at an old shop in a secluded alley in the city. It had no signboard.

"It may look like this on the outside, but it's the best in London."

Soo's words were not wrong. As they entered the shop, numerous mannequins wearing tuxedos and suits caught Kang Hyun's eyes. Soon, an old man with a bent back came out to greet Soo.

"Is this the friend you mentioned, young master?"

"Yes, old man."

"Haha, he looks much younger than I thought. But if the young master has taken him as a friend, he must be quite remarkable."

The old man skillfully took Kang Hyun's measurements. He used a tape measure to measure lengths and matched the fabrics to his skin tone with remarkable efficiency.

The conductor's outfit can vary greatly. Sometimes they wear bespoke suits, and other times just a black shirt. But for formal occasions, they might wear a tailcoat, resembling a penguin with a black back and white belly.

"Let's try them on."

Kang Hyun felt like he had become a Barbie doll. At Soo's words, the old man immediately brought several sample outfits.

As a violinist, a bespoke suit was enough. But as a conductor who must represent the orchestra, it was different. Kang Hyun was trying to put on the clothes himself and stood awkwardly in front of the mirror.

"Hyun, look this way."

Soo personally adjusted Kang Hyun's attire. He was quite adept at fixing the position of the crooked bow tie, a courtesy Kang Hyun had never received even from his wife. Feeling unfamiliar with such kindness, he almost coughed.

"In China, there's a tradition where a student gifts clothes to the teacher. I hope you will wear these clothes and showcase a more splendid stage."

At that moment, the faces of Soo and Hyun were reflected in the mirror.

* * *

"Chrissy, today is the 17th, right?"

It was strange. Audiences were lining up at the London Symphony Concert Hall, where the audition was scheduled. Chrissy glanced at the rearview mirror and confirmed that it was indeed the 17th. Was I wrong? I clearly heard it was a private audition.

"Are there audiences?"

Maestro Spencer's statement made Miles and Matthew's eyes widen. They never expected there would be an audience in the audition hall.

"Why are you so surprised? Even at international competitions, there are audiences on the final day. Think of it as the same setup."

"Maestro, what about the order?"

"We were just about to draw lots."

The result of the draw had Miles going first and me last. Miles looked visibly uneasy. It's understandable since the first order always comes with tension and anxiety. As more audiences filled the concert hall, Matthew was refining his basics.

"This feels more nerve-wracking than the finals of an international competition."

"I agree. From what I hear, they aren't ordinary audiences. Maestro personally invited musicians based in London."

No wonder their eyes were so intense. After all, this wasn't just about selecting a conductor for a royal performance but about being observed by musicians all over England.

Matthew looked at me with shining eyes. More precisely, at the baton in my hand.

"It's made from an olive tree branch."

I had a special baton bought from a German shop called "Fate of the Deer," but I decided to save it for later.

Specifically, I broke a branch from an olive tree in the garden, sanded it, and made the handle with a champagne cork. It's not a particularly unique baton, but if asked why I use it, I would say it's because it was a second gift made by a student for a teacher.

"Miles―!"

Just then, the first conductor was called.

* * *

Spencer looked down at the stage. The audience was filled with many figures from the British classical music scene. Not only musicians but also journalists from music magazines were present, which was expected since it was the day to choose the new face of the London Symphony. Spencer's shoulder condition was already public knowledge.

Unexpectedly, Soo from China was seated next to Spencer. It was surprising, as no one expected the famously proud Soo to personally attend this event. Miles from the U.S. and Matthew from Europe had both taken the stage in succession.

Both performed flawless conducting. As celebrated as they were, their talent as up-and-coming conductors was undeniable. The audience was thrilled by the sharp baton movements and the unfolding melodies. Spencer was curious.

"Soo, what do you think?"

"If you mean the previous two, they handled the stage excellently. Even though it was the same piece, they offered completely different interpretations. I believe they have the skills to excel in any orchestra."

"Yes, especially Matthew was quite surprising. I never imagined he would interpret the transition between movements that way. The other orchestra representatives here must be salivating."

It wasn't wrong. Both Miles and Matthew were extraordinary conductors desired by any orchestra.

Especially as these talented raw gems gain experience and maturity over time, they will undoubtedly become prominent conductors representing their countries.

"Soo, isn't it a waste?"

"If you mean the royal performance, it's not a waste at all."

"Then, what do you think of the last candidate, Hyun?"

Soo thought of Kang Hyun. His pale eyes would light up, and his cheeks would twitch as he recalled the intense memories of Hyun. Among all the musicians he had met, none had left such a vivid and awe-inspiring impression.

Like an ancient tree bearing thousands of fruits in a fantasy world, Hyun's talent was multifaceted. From violin to piano, composition, and conducting, his talents flourished in all areas.

Even one of these would be enough to stir the classical music world, but Hyun's talents bloomed in multiple fields. His scores were so astonishing that they evoked a sense of reverence.

"Miles and Matthew are excellent conductors. Having studied music with them, I know how talented and hardworking they are. They will undoubtedly lead the world's orchestras. However."

"However?"

Individually, they were undoubtedly capable of performing at the royal concert with the London Symphony. However, Soo evaluated Hyun as a "young maestro who moves the world."

"They met the wrong opponent."

Just then, Hyun, in his tailcoat, fluttered onto the stage.
