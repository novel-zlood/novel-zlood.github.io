“How many geniuses have I seen, you ask?”

The past flowed over the blue eyes.

“The Empress Karas of Austria, Eden Simeon of Belgium, Bilstein of the United States, Spencer of London, Hikaru Akazawa of Japan...”

Sweat was beading on Tanaka’s forehead. Upon learning that the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic was in the neighboring country of Korea, he had rushed over.

The gaze that enveloped him was similar to that of the queen of the strings, albeit in a different sense. And the names coming from his mouth were significant. Each one was a titan who had borne the glory of the past.

“These are the conductors I have met. The grand orchestras they directed were enough to make me feel inferior as a conductor.”

“Did you say that you, Maestro, felt inferior?”

Tanaka couldn’t believe it. The person in front of him was undeniably the permanent conductor of the world’s greatest orchestra.

“A musician always lives with a sense of inferiority. Some may feel it toward an unreachable Mozart, while others may feel it toward fellow musicians they compete with. I clearly belong to the latter category.”

“Maestro, are there any conductors in Seoul that you are paying attention to?”

A heated intensity could be felt beneath the raised eyebrows. Despite the passage of time, the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic still had tremendous charisma.

Tanaka swallowed and continued with his next question.

“Maestro, if I may be so bold, could you tell me why you are staying in Korea during your sabbatical? From what I hear, you’ve been invited to prestigious conducting competitions like the Antonio Pedrotti Competition and the Karas Competition.”

Tanaka's eyes were full of curiosity.

No matter how he looked at it, it was strange. The fact that the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic was staying in Seoul, a city not known for its music. Wasn’t it a barren land for classical music?

But the answer that came was unexpected.

“If the goal of global conducting competitions is to find the next generation of maestros, I believe I am already doing that work here in Seoul.”

“What?”

What could this mean? Was there such a famous conductor in Seoul? Before Tanaka could continue his questions, Yuri spoke first.

“You asked if there was a conductor I was paying attention to, right?”

“Yes, Maestro.”

There is a saying that the eyes of the Berlin Philharmonic are in the sky.

This is because their admission auditions are so rigorous. Even many accomplished musicians fail to pass that threshold. In the classical music world, entering the Berlin Philharmonic is considered equivalent to entering the realm of the greats.

Could there be someone on the mind of the lion of such a Berlin Philharmonic? And in Korea, which is called the barren land of classical music?

“Of course, there is.”

Without hesitation, the blue eyes had someone in mind.

“Hyun—!”

It was Dongju who had come after a long time. Dr. Tikhonov ran out excitedly, looking like a family reunion if anyone saw him.

As expected from the talkative doctor, he started pouring out stories about the team members as soon as they met, to the point where it was almost deafening.

“Hyun. We’ve decided to continue researching graphene not only in the electronic materials field but also in the field of bioengineering.”

“What?”

“We have discovered that graphene oxide can act as a mechanism to suppress sepsis. Of course, it’s still in its early stages of progress.”

It didn’t make sense. This was research that would only be revealed in the 21st century. Moreover, wasn’t Dr. Tikhonov a chemist?

Sure, all fields of study are related to life sciences, but this was beyond words.

“Oh, did I not mention? I also studied biology and medicine in the past. I could have continued my career as a doctor after completing my residency in Russia, but chemistry excited me too much. If I hadn’t met chemistry, I would have become a surgeon obsessed with operations.”

I knew he was a genius, but I didn’t realize he was this extraordinary.

Occasionally, there are such talents who are not satisfied with just one field and delve into multiple areas. There was even a chief prosecutor in the Western District who held a medical license.

“Where did you get the idea, Dr.?”

“Remember the advice you gave me in Russia? You said that graphene is like a dense old tree with countless branches and that its applications are limitless. I got the hint from that.”

It was a passing remark to a doctor who was trapped in fixed ideas. It was true that the application fields of graphene, which I had seen in my past life, were diverse.

But to grasp it so accurately with just that remark, it was incredibly astonishing.

“He’s a very pleasant person, isn’t he?”

It was what Grandfather said about Dr. Tikhonov.

After taking me to Grandfather’s office, he bowed his head sharply and said, “Boss, I’ll go back to the research lab now—!” It was as if he was addressing a mafia boss.

“He’s very competent despite his appearance. As you said, Hyun, it was a wise choice to select the creative and free-spirited Dr. Tikhonov instead of a stuffy person.”

“No, it was just luck. By the way, Grandfather, you said you had something to tell me today?”

It was an unexpected summons. Normally, this would be the time to help the children with their orchestra practice, but today, due to Grandfather’s call, I came to Dongju.

“Your graduation is in a week, right?”

“Yes, Grandfather.”

“Now that you’ve become a high school student, it’s time to tell you.”

Grandfather unlocked a drawer with a key, as if he had been waiting for this moment. Inside was a brown envelope.

“Hyun, take a look.”

Just like the previous time when he handed me a bundle of documents, he gave it to me in whole. Could there be an issue with Dongju that I don’t know about?

Grandfather gestured towards the sofa with a nod. It seemed like the amount of documents was substantial, so he was telling me to sit down and read.

Click.

I naturally sat on the sofa and picked up a pen. With a click, I started flipping through the pages.

“Grandfather?”

Throughout reading the documents, my face was filled with puzzlement. Most of the content was about real estate and financial assets, but among them were many treasures I knew of.

Especially in the list of overseas stocks, there were names of giant companies that everyone would know in the future.

Of course, there were some misses, but this investment list was impressive enough to rival the touch of Midas.

“These are the recommendations from Yooha’s grandfather. If I transferred Dongju’s shares, your uncles wouldn’t stay quiet. I don’t know how much longer this grandfather will live. The gift has been completed without any issues, so don’t worry.”

“What do you mean?”

I didn’t understand.

“It wouldn’t be bad for you to discern with your excellent eye rather than this grandfather holding onto it. Although this grandfather made the list, it’s up to you to judge what is real and fake within it.”

My throat moved up and down. It felt like someone had shaken my mind. I bit the inside of my cheek to make sure, and the stinging sensation confirmed that this was not a dream.

Summing up Grandfather’s words, it all meant that everything listed here was “Yours, Hyun.”

Crunch, crunch—

The sound of stepping on snow tickled my ears. It was my last winter break, but I was heading to school as usual.

To prepare for the orchestra performance on graduation day, I had been practicing diligently without missing a single day. The children’s skills had improved remarkably, to the extent that it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say they had made significant progress.

But still.

- It’s yours, Hyun.

Grandfather’s voice kept echoing in my head.

Grandfather had clearly said that it was up to me to judge what is real and fake within the list he had handed over.

Though such things were not difficult for me, it was something that needed more time.

Maybe my palm lines had changed due to the calluses from playing the violin. From royalties to everything else, it was clear that my life had taken a different turn, one blessed with fortune.

As I approached the music room, I heard the sound of tuning.

It was time to return to the role of a conductor.

Zing.

The tuning was off. Beads of sweat were forming on Lee Jin-ho's face. As the concertmaster, he had to play a solo part.

Wasn’t it a piece he had never heard before, a score he had never seen before? It was natural to be unfamiliar with it. But.

“Jin-ho, can I talk to you for a moment?”

I called Lee Jin-ho aside, away from the other students’ eyes.

“When you play the solo part, you lose confidence. Your shoulders become unbalanced, and your breathing becomes rough. As a result, the speed of your fingers plucking the strings noticeably slows down. Jin-ho, if you falter, the orchestra will waver.”

The roles of the concertmaster and the members are different. Moreover, a concertmaster who cannot properly perform the solo part cannot earn the respect of the members.

In a small orchestra, if the concertmaster falters, the members are likely to collapse like dominos. Therefore, I had to push him.

“There’s only a week left until graduation. I’m going to push you to your limits until then. It will be tough, but can you keep up?”

“I’ll definitely keep up, Hyun.”

Seeing Lee Jin-ho’s determined expression, I nodded.

Like Baek Jung-hoon, he would need to undergo Spartan training. He would have to practice and practice all night long.

“Is it tomorrow?”

Yuri recalled what Kang Hyun had said earlier. He had mentioned that he would perform a composition of his own at the orchestra performance on graduation day.

He must have arranged it to suit the small orchestra. So, naturally, she was curious. She had already experienced Kang Hyun's composition skills.

It was a late hour with a hint of twilight. However, Kang Hyun's studio was lit up as if it were daytime.

“Did you say the boy who was the concertmaster? He’s working hard until the last day.”

Yuri picked up a blanket and covered the backs of the two boys. They had fallen asleep sitting up, having practiced for so long.

Especially the boy who was the concertmaster, whose hand was full of calluses, indicating that if he continued to pursue music without giving up, he would shine one day.

Yuri moved her steps and looked at Kang Hyun, who was sleeping with his head on the synthesizer.

“What will you show, violinist Hyun?”

She would find out tomorrow, but she was already curious. What kind of piece would he create with his own orchestra?

He was a boy who absorbed knowledge as if he were drawing it in. She wanted to introduce this boy to the members of the Berlin Philharmonic right away, so eager was her heart.

She was curious about what the prideful members would say upon seeing this young boy.

“Jino, that’s not how you do it... Again, again... again...”

Just then, Kang Hyun muttered to himself as if talking in his sleep. He was probably teaching the boy who was the concertmaster even in his dreams.

For that boy, it would be a fortune worth more than gold. Kang Hyun was someone who would soon carve his name into the classical music world. At that moment,

Swish.

As Kang Hyun muttered in his sleep, the sheet music on the synthesizer slipped and fell to the floor.

Yuri bent down and carefully picked up the fallen sheet music. Her blue eyes slowly scanned the notes on the staff, as if savoring them.

Andante Cantabile, the score evoked memories of Tchaikovsky’s piece.

The composition was slow but splendid, like a flower bud blooming and revealing its form. Yuri was captivated by the composition of the notes.

It conveyed a deep beauty that words could not describe.

It felt like a serene performance of youthful laughter by a lakeside, a spotless, pure musical idea. The finale, which struck the heart, was perfect for a day that marked both an end and a beginning like graduation.

“Violinist Hyun, you even make me feel inferior.”

Yuri knew. She could be Mozart to someone, or conversely, she could be Salieri to someone else.

But contrary to her words, a deep smile was on her face more than ever.
