"You're twenty this year?"

Kim Namcheon looked at me with a curious gaze, as if he were admiring a treasure.

"Yes, sir."

"Hoho, no matter how I look at you, your eyes are extraordinary. You look like a young man, but the light in your eyes is just as sharp as that of old men. Are you harboring an old man inside your body?"

"Pardon?"

"It was a joke."

I felt a sharp prickle, as if a needle had pierced my heart. Given the combined lifespan of my previous lives, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say I had an old man inside me.

At that moment, Kim Namcheon took a sip from his teacup and turned his gaze toward my grandfather.

"Dongyul, I've heard so much about your grandson from various sources. If you have the time, may I have a longer conversation with him?"

"Of course, sir."

My grandfather nodded briefly. Kim Namcheon's eyes continued to scan me like a snake.

It was hard to believe that such a piercing gaze belonged to an elderly man nearing a hundred.

I wanted to head to Seoul immediately, but I couldn't.

"Your name is Kang Hyun, right?"

"Yes, sir."

"What do you think about the conversation I had with your grandfather just now? If Daeil Group falls into the hands of Chairman Son Ilsung, the Korean press will fall under Daeil Group in less than ten years."

What should I say? I thought about feigning ignorance, but for some reason, I didn't want to. The more I talked with Kim Namcheon, the more likely I was to gain some unknown insight.

"It is possible."

My grandfather's eyes widened. However, Kim Namcheon smiled broadly as if he had expected this.

"Can you explain why you think so?"

"It is just as you said, sir. Chairman Son Ilsung's management philosophy is different from Chairman Son Jangwon's. Think of it in terms of royal authority. Chairman Son Jangwon, as the founding chairman of Daeil Group, has overwhelming power and legitimacy. On the other hand, Chairman Son Ilsung has numerous concerns, starting with his siblings and including the founding members of the group. While Chairman Son Jangwon absorbed his enemies with inclusivity, Chairman Son Ilsung would cut them off in one stroke."

This was my assessment of Chairman Son Ilsung based on my previous life.

He maintained a vastly different management philosophy from Chairman Son Jangwon. Indeed, without being so cold and sharp, he wouldn't have survived the battlefield of business.

"Sir, may I ask you a question?"

"Hoho, are you curious about something?"

"Yes, sir."

I was quite curious about Kim Namcheon's insight. He was called a collaborator during the Japanese occupation and an opportunist during the military regime.

Some might say he was a parasite, but another view would be that he had an exceptional vision for the future.

"What do you think are the odds of Son Jangwon's second son, Son Gangwook, beating his eldest son, Son Ilsung?"

"Click, click, that's an interesting question."

Kim Namcheon looked intrigued. He hadn't expected me to ask such a question.

My grandfather swallowed nervously, watching our conversation closely. Kim Namcheon answered without hesitation.

"Thirty percent."

"……!"

I couldn't help but be surprised. In my previous life, Chairman Son Ilsung had been a standout among the greatest management experts. Some even said he was a talent surpassing Chairman Son Jangwon.

Indeed, if not for him, he wouldn't have made Korea into a Daeil Republic. For someone to have a thirty percent chance of beating Chairman Son Ilsung was astounding.

"Son Gangwook is a hidden dragon, thoroughly concealing himself below the surface. But after Chairman Son Jangwon suddenly fell ill, he must have had many thoughts. If Son Ilsung takes over Daeil Group, he would immediately target Son Gangwook."

"Are you saying Chairman Son Ilsung is wary of Son Gangwook?"

"Of course. The one Son Ilsung sees as the biggest thorn in Daeil Group is his younger brother, Son Gangwook."

In my previous life, I had no knowledge of Son Gangwook. By the time I became a Daeil Group scholarship student, Son Ilsung had already become the chairman.

Son Gangwook had been erased from Daeil Group's history as if by an eraser.

However, if Kim Namcheon's words about Son Ilsung being intensely wary of Son Gangwook were true, it made sense.

How much time had passed? The outside was already growing dark.

"Dongyul, come visit often. The older I get, the more I miss having someone to talk to."

"Yes, sir."

"And your name is Kang Hyun, right?"

Kim Namcheon added as he personally saw us off.

"Let's meet often as well."

* * *

We were on our way back to Seoul from Daegu. As we drove along the highway under the twilight, my grandfather glanced at me.

"It seems Kim Namcheon liked you quite a bit, Hyun."

"Me?"

"Yes, he isn't usually that talkative. Especially, he never reveals his inner thoughts without getting something in return. But he answered your question without hesitation."

Just thinking about Kim Namcheon's gaze made me feel like a squid writhing on a hot grill.

I suddenly became curious about the relationship between my grandfather and Kim Namcheon. No matter how much I thought about it, I couldn't see any connection between them.

"Grandfather, have you known him for a long time?"

"How could I not? When I came to Seoul as a young man, he was already one of the wealthiest men in Joseon. Many people pointed fingers at him, calling him a traitor to the nation. But there's one thing many people don't know."

"Something they don't know?"

My grandfather nodded briefly.

"Kim Namcheon not only funded the independence movement but also continuously provided political funds for Korea's democracy. It was unique. He managed to increase his wealth while walking such a tightrope. One day, I asked him out of curiosity. Why did he act as a spy between the Japanese and the independence fighters? If the Japanese had found out, he wouldn't have survived. The answer I got was remarkable."

Gulp.

"He said he was buying insurance in case of liberation. He might appear to be a typical opportunist, but in another view, he was someone with an exceptional vision for the future. It's no exaggeration to say that major business tycoons and seasoned politicians feared him."

It was a more astonishing story than I knew about Kim Namcheon. Indeed, such anecdotes hadn't appeared in Kim Namcheon's autobiography.

As my grandfather said, Kim Namcheon had an extraordinary vision for the future. At that moment,

"There's one more reason why Chairman Son needs to recover quickly."

"One more reason?"

"Yes, Kim Namcheon seems very interested in you, Hyun. He asked me again while you were in the restroom."

About what?

"He asked what I thought about you marrying his great-granddaughter."

* * *

Thirty percent.

Kim Namcheon had said that Son Gangwook had a thirty percent chance of beating Son Ilsung.

The reason Kim Namcheon didn't side with Son Ilsung was simple. Son Ilsung, who was even more cunning than Chairman Son Jangwon, was not a trustworthy ally.

'I wonder what kind of person he is.'

I couldn't help but be curious. I had almost no information about Son Gangwook.

Even now, he was only sitting in the position of Executive Director of Jeil Trading without leaving much of an impression. But for Son Ilsung to be so wary of him?

[The stock price of Daeil Group is fluctuating daily. Meanwhile, it has been reported that Jeil Electronics has been accused of accounting fraud. Chairman Son Ilsung of Jeil Electronics voluntarily appeared before the prosecution this afternoon. Experts predict another wave in the stock market. Let's connect with the reporter on the scene at the prosecution.]

The news was full of stories about Daeil Group.

Scenes of Chairman Son Ilsung, dressed in a suit and appearing before the prosecution, were being broadcast continuously. The stock price must be fluctuating like a storm.

"Mr. Kim, buy all the stocks related to Daeil Group."

"Now?"

"Yes, especially Jeil Electronics stocks that are being thrown out at the opening. Buy them without worrying about the price."

Manager Kim briefly pondered and then nodded.

To an outsider, it might seem like madness. If Chairman Son Ilsung were confirmed guilty and the accounting fraud turned out to be true, Jeil Electronics' stock price would plummet.

But I already knew the future wouldn't be like that. Now was the perfect opportunity.

"Then I'll get back to my music work."

Manager Kim nodded and left.

I turned off the noisy TV and sat back at the synthesizer in my studio.

There was no need to overthink. I had done all I could regarding Daeil Group.

How much time had passed? Just as the musical notes were filling up the staff,

I noticed people moving busily beyond the studio.

Who could it be?

It was a day when the gallery wasn't open. Jeil Gallery was supposed to remain quiet for a while.

Given the prosecution's investigation into the accounting fraud at Jeil Electronics, it was obvious they would first investigate Jeil Gallery and the Jeil Foundation. It was an open secret that Jeil Gallery was connected to the Jeil Foundation.

When I opened the door, I saw Jeil Gallery employee Kim Mihyun moving quickly.

Several black sedans had already arrived outside the gallery.

They didn't seem to be from the prosecution. But who would come to visit Director Im Hyera amid the storm surrounding Daeil Group?

At that moment,

"Excuse me."

A voice unexpectedly came from behind. When I turned my head, my eyes widened. But I quickly erased my expression and stepped aside.

A group of people in black suits was entering. However, the most noticeable among them was the man at the front.

He had an imposing figure. The phrase "well-built" suited him well. His broad shoulders and piercing eyes were striking. Even his walk was reminiscent of a general.

He wore a gentle smile, but no one could fathom his true intentions. He had never appeared in Pyeongchang-dong. It was Son Jangwon's second son, Son Gangwook, whom I had only seen in photos.

In that moment,

Step.

Son Gangwook stopped and turned to look at me.
