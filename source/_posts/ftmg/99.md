“You rascal, are you planning to become a Go player?” Chairman Wang furrowed his brow as he glared at the Go board. No way could he play a mere courtesy game of Go.

In the meantime, Chairman Wang’s Go skills had significantly improved since the last time I saw him.

“Grandfather, have you been taking Go lessons while I was away?”

“Why do you think so?”

“Your spirit has changed.”

People often say that Go is a battle of spirits. If in the past, it was about making aggressive moves and constantly engaging in battles, now it was about taking a step back and observing the opponent.

Even though I prompted a speed game to exploit gaps, Chairman Wang’s spirit remained unshaken. His thick, practical Go, like reading moves with the spirit of a towering mountain, had a resemblance to Lee Changho’s style. Could it be?

“Did you get lessons from Lee Changho, the 9-dan player?”

For a moment, Chairman Wang’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.

“Ahem, how long are you going to leave the violin to your grandfather? Not just one, but two of them.”

Seeing him trying hard to change the topic, it seemed I hit the mark.

The safe in Pyeongchang-dong had near-perfect temperature and humidity control, making it an ideal place to store old violins that were difficult to manage.

“Are you paying a storage fee?”

“I’m playing Go with you right now, aren’t I?”

“You always try to beat your grandfather, yet you speak well.”

Despite his words, a faint smile lingered on his lips.

Chairman Wang had spent his life on the front lines of the business world, experiencing all sorts of hardships. Perhaps that’s why he didn’t like playing Go lightly. In that sense, I was a perfect match.

Clack—!

In just one move, the black stones were captured. Chairman Wang furrowed his brow and then let out a sigh as he placed the stone down.

“How is it that your skills improve every day? If you have a secret, please share it with your grandfather. Just when I think I can catch up, you are already far ahead.”

If there was a secret, I didn’t know what to say. Though I was pretty good at Go in my past life, I wasn’t this good.

Thanks to advanced software, wasn’t I better at reading moves compared to before? If I could see ten steps ahead in the past, now I could see a hundred meters ahead.

“Hyun, why don’t you stay for dinner and look at the photos I took?”

“Photos?”

What photos was he talking about? Chairman Wang’s eyes had a mysterious glint, hinting at something I wasn’t aware of. However,

“I’m sorry, but I have a prior engagement today.”

“A prior engagement? At this late hour?”

“I have to go for a lesson.”

Chairman Wang looked puzzled, as if he couldn’t understand.

“Hyun, who are you learning from?”

“What do you think conducting is?” Yury’s gaze was as serious as ever.

He was the lion of the Berlin Phil, considered the best among many orchestras. As the principal conductor, his reputation was unimaginably high.

“I think of it as a single instrument, Maestro.”

It wasn’t a wrong answer, but Yury spoke to the boy sitting across from him.

“Conducting is a grand resonance. When the conductor steps onto the podium, numerous members’ eyes focus on his fingertips. If you can’t captivate the prideful members instantly, your fingertips lose confidence, and eventually, you lose direction. That’s why novice conductors often feel frustrated on stage and sometimes give up on music.”

“Give up on music?”

“The countless melodies of the instruments blend together, creating a cacophony that assaults the ears. This is the violin, that’s the cello, and that booming sound is the timpani. It would feel like being in the middle of a battlefield. Many conductors, even before their debut, were crushed by the pressure and fled the orchestra. This has been happening since the time of Mozart and even before.”

It would be due to the unimaginable pressure that engulfed them.

Moreover, as musicians, it would feel like a denial of their own lives, a sense of loss that couldn’t be described in words.

As Yury said, many conductors fled before even stepping on stage.

What happens if an unskilled person takes the podium? In the past, there were numerous cases where famous orchestras expelled conductors, so there’s no need to elaborate.

“I don’t understand why Hyun suddenly wants to learn conducting. To me, you seem like a perfect violinist. Just because you are proficient with the violin doesn’t mean you’ll be good at conducting. It’s like a child who is good at walking finding it difficult to run. Why choose a difficult path?” 

Kang Hyun answered without hesitation.

“Because I really want to try performing it.”

Yury nodded briefly. Every musician has, at least once, dreamt of playing the grand instrument that is the orchestra.

However, numerous verifications are required to ascend the podium. Without them, if you step onto the podium, the melodies of countless members will die with a single gesture.

“What do you think is the difference between Spencer, Eden Simeon, and me, Yury Dianov, Violinist Hyun?”

“They are conductors with different styles.”

“Different styles?”

Again, Kang Hyun didn’t hesitate. It was as if he had been waiting for Yury’s question, nodding his head.

“The conduct of the three of you has distinctly different characters. Even when performing a piece by the same composer, the markings may indicate andante, but Maestro Spencer’s heart might feel adagio, Eden Simeon’s fingertips might express allegretto, and Yury Dianov’s eyes might show allegro. I’ve watched all the orchestra performance videos without missing any.”

Yury’s eyes showed a clear sign of interest. “Then what do you think is the commonality among the three?”

“I think it's the respect for the composer.”

“Respect for the composer?”

What was he trying to say?

“I’ve seen videos of you three conducting Beethoven’s symphonies. For instance, Maestros who would usually express the flow of music freely with their fingertips followed the score meticulously when it came to Beethoven’s pieces. Maestro Eden Simeon has a tendency to raise his right hand exaggeratedly when asking for legato in the second movement, but he doesn’t do so with Beethoven’s pieces.”

Yury couldn’t understand.

“Can you notice such detailed parts through videos?”

“I watched them repeatedly until the tapes wore out.”

“Ha.”

Keen observation was one of the most essential qualities for a conductor.

Yury couldn’t hide his admiration as the boy in front of him revealed more layers like peeling an onion.

Part of him felt anticipation. How much more did the boy have to show?

Yury was sipping a martini to savor the lingering feeling.

It had already been a month since he started teaching Hyun. Every day was filled with admiration. Was this how the teachers who taught Mozart felt?

“He knows the score inside out.”

A conductor had to know the score as if they memorized it. Which instruments are used, what the markings are, even the emotional state of the composer when composing the symphony.

In that aspect, Hyun showed incredible insight. After all, he had unraveled Eden’s mysteries in the chapel.

The surprises didn’t end there.

-In the second movement, I think this part is a mistake by the composer. It’s probably due to an excess of emotion. The audience may see it as a moment of joy.

It was a piece by an unknown Italian musician. The composer wasn’t famous, so there were few people who had seen the score.

But Yury tried hard to calm his surprise upon hearing Hyun’s words. Someone in the past had said something similar.

-The way conductors express a 4/4 beat is mostly similar. From bottom to right, then left, and up again, accurately conveying the rhythm is important. But the way they express music is different. Some want to push strongly through the soft parts, while others want to play softly in the emphasized parts. Especially with Mozart’s pieces.

Mozart’s pieces, unlike Beethoven’s, have vague markings.

Perhaps that’s why some say Mozart’s scores show his consideration for the performers. It means they constantly evoke imagination.

-I think symphonies should resemble Mozart’s. Rather than thinking of a dead composer, music should be recreated at the fingertips of the living conductor. If Beethoven were to come back to life, he might say, “Why are those people all trying to imitate me?” I apologize if this was a disrespectful remark to the Maestro.

Recalling Hyun hurriedly bowing his head, Yury smiled faintly. A natural genius also possesses abundant imagination.

Indeed, boldness and creativity were the most necessary virtues for a conductor. The audience didn’t come to the concert hall to listen to the same symphony every time.

In that sense, Hyun deserved full marks.

“A vodka martini, shaken, not stirred.”

In a manner reminiscent of James Bond, Yury ordered another martini from the bartender.

Tonight, it seemed he would spend the night with martinis. To shake off this profound lingering feeling, it seemed he wouldn’t be able to endure until dawn arrived.

‘Have I ever felt such joy in teaching someone?’ A faint smile appeared on Yury’s lips.

“Piano—!”

Startled by my shout, the piano, which was responsible for the basic accompaniment including the arpeggios, snapped to attention.

From the cello and violin to the contrabass. It was a small ensemble.

The auditorium was too small, and we couldn’t fill the entire orchestra, so we had no choice but to proceed on a smaller scale.

“Hyunseon, as the accompanist, your breathing is too fast. Right now, I can give you signals loudly, but you can’t do that during the graduation ceremony. Don’t try to follow other players’ melodies. The more impatiently you press the keys, the more mistakes you’ll make.”

It was a small orchestra to be showcased at the graduation ceremony.

Most of them had enough skill to participate in youth competitions, but they were inexperienced in ensemble playing.

It was their first time playing with many instruments, so it was understandable.

“Jinho, you are responsible for the flow of the string section. But what happens if you get nervous from the start of the piece? The violins will look to you if they can’t follow my fingertips.”

In a way, this child had the role of the concertmaster. His tightly closed lips and resolute nod showed his determination.

Initially, the kids were unsure, but when I pointed out every mistake, they couldn’t help but stare with their mouths open.

It was unbelievable to them that I could find each wrong part among so many melodies.

“Let’s take a short break.”

Even though we had been playing for several hours, there was no sign of fatigue on the kids’ faces. During the break, they continued to look over the scores and discuss their opinions.

“Hyun, can I ask you something about this part?”

It was Jinho, who had the role of the concertmaster. From the first day, he had constantly asked me questions, noting my advice meticulously in his notebook.

He was doing the same now, holding a notebook and pen tightly as he approached me.

‘Come to think of it.’

His sharp face and deep-set features reminded me of someone. Dmitri from the London Symphony Orchestra.

I suppressed a smile as I sincerely answered the concertmaster’s questions.

Most of the questions were about the flow of the performance, probably due to their unfamiliarity with orchestra playing. It would naturally resolve over time.

Clap—!

At the sound of my clapping, the kids returned to their positions. As soon as the break ended, their eyes turned serious again. I liked it.

I was using the know-how I learned from the lion of the Berlin Phil without holding back here. Every time I played the grand instrument that is the orchestra, my heart raced. It pounded as if cheering.

“There’s not much time left until the graduation ceremony. Let’s make a splendid finale.”

As my fingertips pointed toward the sky,

Dudududung—!
