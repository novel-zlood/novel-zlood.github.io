“1 million dollars―!”

People started raising their bids as if a fuse had been lit.

The atmosphere was different from previous charity auctions. At first, people had participated in the charity auction leisurely, but now they were as serious as if they were going to war.

Tommy swallowed nervously without realizing it.

“1.6 million dollars.”

“1.8 million dollars.”

“2 million dollars―!”

It happened in an instant. The bidding skyrocketed to astronomical amounts in the blink of an eye.

Tommy looked at Kang Hyun with trembling eyes.

Contrary to the tense atmosphere, Kang Hyun, the main character of the auction, showed no sign of being shaken. If anything, his eyes seemed to say he had expected this to happen.

Tommy was not only amazed by Kang Hyun’s composure but also couldn’t help but admire his piano skills.

Kang Hyun, who had already shown his abilities as a conductor, was known to be good at the piano, but not to this extent.

To exaggerate, he would not be out of place if he were to enter the piano department of the Royal College of Music right now.

How much time had passed?

As the auctioneer called out the third bid, the sound of the gavel hitting the auction block echoed through the hall.

The final bid price was the highest in the history of Gramophone magazine.

Adam smiled faintly as if to prove his words were not wrong. At that moment,

“Hyun, if it’s not too much trouble, could I ask you a favor?”

Dante, who was hosting the charity auction, looked at Kang Hyun and added,

“I find it unfortunate that such a beautiful piece is only numbered. I think it’s even more ridiculous for someone else to name this piece. If it’s okay with you, could you name the piece here and now?”

Others also nodded in agreement with Dante’s words.

Kang Hyun never names his pieces when he writes the scores. He always thought numbering was enough.

But he couldn’t ignore the gazes of so many people.

“Four Seasons.”

A satisfied smile spread across Dante’s face at Kang Hyun’s voice. The title matched the atmosphere of the piece perfectly.

The winning bidder was Austin, the representative of EMA. He smiled a smile no one had seen before, looking truly delighted.

Tommy understood his feelings completely. Even if he had spent millions of dollars, could it compare to the Four Seasons he had just witnessed? It was as if the Four Seasons had unfolded right before their eyes.

Soon after,

The charity auction ended, and the main event began. Awards related to classical music followed.

Musicians who had shone this year came up on stage to greet and receive awards. Everyone already seemed to know who would win the last award, Album of the Year, even before the name was called.

Naturally, no one in the audience could dispute his name.

Dante smiled and called out the musician’s name written on the white paper.

“Violinist Hyun.”

“Oh my God!”

Exclamations of admiration burst out one after another in a mansion in Beverly Hills.

James Cameron, the legendary director, continued to express pure admiration for a young man on the screen.

The program was a documentary called Documentary7 from Asia.

-Did you all see that? Just now, Kang Hyun answered all the questions posed by Spencer, the chief conductor of the London Symphony, without a single mistake. Not only I, the producer, but also the cameraman are dumbfounded. We never imagined there could be mistakes in the symphony.

It was unbelievable. Was he not a musical genius that could only appear in movies? Could this be how the nobles felt when they witnessed the mysterious talents of Mozart firsthand?

James Cameron leaned forward, ignoring the sweat forming in his palms.

-The Maestro has handed the baton to Kang Hyun. He’s suggesting conducting together with the members now. I have a feeling this will be an incredible scene. Let’s watch together, viewers!

Kang Hyun’s conducting was bewitching viewers in a different way than when he played the violin.

While the violin displayed a myriad of musical ideas like various masks, conducting was akin to a monarch, dominating the stage with both hands.

James Cameron watched the three-part documentary without taking a break.

Although it wasn’t an officially imported program and had clumsy subtitles, understanding the language was unnecessary when listening to Kang Hyun’s music.

The more James Cameron thought about Kang Hyun, the more a screenplay was etched into his mind.

Kang Hyun had said he would never act. But even if it was just his music, that would suffice.

Even Cameron, who was notoriously picky when it came to movies, felt his heart waver because of Kang Hyun’s music.

However, Kang Hyun’s face still lingered in his mind. Wasn’t it such a waste to confine him only to music?

His pure yet sexy appearance, along with his decadent gaze, could rival even DiCaprio from Titanic. What’s more,

Vrrr.

How could one describe the enigmatic look when he played the violin? Orientalism alone couldn’t explain it.

Though he looked like a young man, his aura was that of a grandmaster.

James Cameron had a hunch. That young man would undoubtedly become a blue chip that would bring about a significant change in Hollywood.

* * *

“In Hollywood?”

Kang Hyun was stunned by the unexpected news he heard over the phone.

He was aware that Documentary7 had aired in Korea and gained popularity. It had recorded the highest viewership ratings in K Broadcasting’s history. Because of that, he had received countless CF offers in Korea.

But Hollywood, not even Chungmuro?

-I mentioned it before, didn’t I? Hollywood has been sending love calls to you from time to time. This time, a famous director contacted us directly.

Director Im Hyera’s voice was noticeably excited. Anyone listening would think she had received a letter from her first love.

Who could have contacted her to make her this excited? He couldn’t understand.

But his doubts were somewhat resolved by her following words.

-Director James Cameron, you know him, right?

How could he not know!

How much had he liked his Alien and Terminator series? Moreover, Titanic and Into the Storm were masterpieces deeply etched into his memory.

Even in his past life, James Cameron was one of the most renowned directors in Hollywood. But why had such a famous director contacted him?

-He said he wants to make a movie with you as the lead!

“What?”

-He even wrote a script with you in mind as the main character. He’s so eager that he’s ready to fly to England right now.

He had received love calls to play lead roles in movies before. But he had declined all roles so far.

The reason was simple. He wasn’t originally an actor, and reading scripts in front of the camera didn’t suit his temperament.

But he couldn’t recall any of James Cameron’s films from his past life that he could have played a role in. What could this be about?

-Why don’t you at least meet him once?

At Director Im Hyera’s suggestion, Kang Hyun gazed out the window.

The cold sun shone, heralding the beginning of winter. He had a feeling it wouldn’t be so bad to take a trip to the U.S. for some fresh air.

* * *

“Yooha, how was your trip to England?”

At Michelle’s question, Son Yooha made a regretful expression.

“It was too short.”

She had taken a big step and flown to England. While it was great to meet Kang Hyun, the time they spent together was too short.

Michelle, seeing Son Yooha’s regretful expression, exclaimed,

“Yooha, I never imagined you’d be so devoted. I’ve felt it for a while, but it seems you’ll be the first among our friends to get married.”

“What? I’m still too young to talk about marriage…”

“Huh? Camilla is already engaged. Some friends will definitely marry as soon as they become adults. But to think the great Son Yooha would be so flustered by the word marriage!”

Michelle’s playful expression and narrowed eyes were evident.

Wasn’t Son Yooha always exuding a cold aura, comparable to the northern winds of Moscow?

She was the queen among many male students, never giving any of them a single glance. But now, she was blushing and flustered.

“Yooha, by the way, Hyun oppa was in another column again.”

“You mean Gramophone magazine?”

“Yeah, they said he won the Album of the Year award. He looked so cool. Many people have developed an interest in classical music because of Hyun oppa. His popularity is through the roof these days.”

It was no exaggeration to say that Kang Hyun was the idol of the classical music world.

Not only had he won the Album of the Year award from Gramophone magazine, but he was also gaining popularity in Korea due to the documentary. 

It was said that he had a fan club in Korea rivaling that of any boy group.

“But don’t worry, Yooha. Even if Hollywood’s Wendy comes, she won’t be a match for you.”

Michelle spoke as if reading Son Yooha’s thoughts, even mentioning a sexy Hollywood actress.

“It’s okay, I’m confident too!”

Son Yooha clenched her fists and shouted. It was a different side of her that would surprise anyone who knew her. Indeed, the power of love was strong enough to change even one’s personality.

“Yooha, you’re really head over heels for Hyun oppa. I wonder when I’ll find such love. Just listening to your stories about you and Hyun oppa feels like watching a romantic movie.”

“What about Andy, who you met the other day?”

“Don’t even mention it! He’s a total playboy. I caught him kissing another girl at the social club. I doused him with water on the spot.”

As Son Yooha and Michelle were deep in conversation,

“Oh, Yooha, your car is here.”

“Michelle, I have to go now.”

“Alright, see you tomorrow!”

At that moment, the car to pick up Yooha arrived. In the driver’s seat was an employee of Daeil Group, responsible for driving and security.

The next destination was obvious. Even after school, Yooha always received private lessons from Ivy League associate professors. However,

“Where are we going now?”

They were taking a different route than usual. Son Yooha looked at the driver in surprise.

The driver glanced at her through the rearview mirror and asked,

“Miss, where would you like to go?”

Seeing the driver’s reflection in the mirror, Son Yooha couldn’t hide her smile.
