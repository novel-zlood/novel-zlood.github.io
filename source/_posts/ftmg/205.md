“Phew...”

Dmitri, the concertmaster of the London Symphony, was exhaling rough breaths.

It wasn't just the concertmaster. The other members looked as if they had been through a wringer, their eyes darkened underneath.

Even Michael, who was known for his talkativeness, was sweating with his dry lips tightly shut.

“Thank you for keeping up with the journey so far. I am more than moved by your passion. For the upcoming concert, I, as the conductor, will work even harder so that you can fully showcase your skills.”

At Maestro Karas's words, the members sighed.

They had been practicing continuously for over a month. The members, who were known for their high pride, couldn't keep their composure in the face of Karas's rigorous training, feeling like soldiers newly enlisted in the military.

Well, Empress Karas was as great a figure as her reputation suggested. The members described Karas like this:

“She has musical sense surpassing Hyun and the perseverance and focus of Maestro Spencer.”

In a good light, that's what they said, but to exaggerate, she was a ‘practice fanatic.’

Someone even joked that if Maestro Karas hadn't decided to retire, the members of the Berlin Philharmonic would have decided to retire first because of such rigorous training.

But the effect was immense. The members of the renowned London Symphony had worked with numerous maestros, but none had improved their skills in such a short time as Karas.

“For the next week, it will be personal practice and rest. You've been running non-stop, so you need a short time to review.”

“Maestro, review?”

“Yes, if you haven't reviewed properly in a week, we will have to have another lesson.”

The members' throats gulped simultaneously. They couldn't go through this hellish training again.

Except for eating and sleeping, they had been glued to the symphony for a month.

When rehearsing, Karas's eyes exuded charisma incomparable to usual, tolerating no dropouts.

Although Karas was smiling faintly, the members tensed up even more at that smile.

“Are you going to Korea yourself, Maestro?”

“Yes, I plan to go myself.”

“It would be great if you could stay with the members during the remaining period. I haven't seen the members struggling so much in a long time.”

Spencer seemed to like this hellish training.

After all, hadn't there been many times when he couldn't rehearse properly due to his unwell shoulder?

Karas had filled that gap perfectly, so he was truly grateful.

If it had been an ordinary guest conductor, they would never have managed it.

Then Karas spoke with eyes as innocent as a girl's.

“This is a comeback stage after deciding to retire. I want to personally give the ticket to Hyun. If it weren't for that child, I would never have picked up the baton again in my life.”

Spencer nodded briefly with a smile, understanding her feelings.

On the other hand, he had another thought. What blessing from the god of music did Hyun receive to be so loved by the world's maestros?

* * *

“It's like a palace, a palace!”

Teacher Deoksoo looked around the chairman's office and burst into hearty laughter. It was a natural comment since it was the place where the head of Daeil Group resided.

Chairman Wang's taste was the opposite of his grandfather’s, with sophisticated and expensive furniture everywhere.

Moreover, the spacious area seemed to accommodate an entire department. As Teacher Deoksoo said, calling it a palace wouldn't be an exaggeration!

“If I had known my student was living so well, I would have come down from the mountain earlier and stuck by him. This chairman's office is bigger than my house in Jirisan.”

“Elder, pardon me, but what did the executive just say?”

“What?”

“Didn't he call you Chairman?”

Moreover, didn't the executives guide Teacher Deoksoo respectfully to the chairman's office?

Everyone in the Daeil Group headquarters lobby had their mouths wide open, watching the scene, surprised.

The executives who guided Teacher Deoksoo were all people of immense status and power, called the elders of Daeil Group.

Even if President Son Ilseon came, they wouldn't have bowed ninety degrees like that.

“You're Hyun, right? Sometimes you have a habit of asking the obvious. Usually, suspicious people use that kind of rhetoric. Were you a prosecutor or lawyer in a previous life, or did you dream of becoming a legal professional in the future?”

I felt a twinge in my heart. But Teacher Deoksoo shook his head, as if it was a boring joke, and added.

“It's as it sounds; I'm the chairman of Daeil Group now.”

“What?”

“This had been in progress for years. My student came to me while I was farming in Jirisan and asked me to take over his shares. I suddenly became the richest man in Jirisan. My student must have seen that he would die or be bedridden for unavoidable reasons.”

As expected of Chairman Wang!

“I sort of knew. The second son always looked suspicious. I wanted to shave his head and send him to a temple I know, but, as you see, as a father, I couldn't do that. In the end, he was destined to be backstabbed. Tsk tsk.”

“What do you plan to do, Elder?”

“Asking the same thing again?”

Teacher Deoksoo said, stroking an orchid.

“Didn’t I say I was going tiger hunting? Do you know why my student asked an old master farming in Jirisan, not his childhood friend or eldest son, to take over? Because I am a descendant of the best tiger hunters in Joseon.”

“Elder, this is not the time for jokes.”

“Hey, I'm serious. By now, the tiger must be in a trap I laid. He may want to see my face right now, but he can't come recklessly. He wears the mask of a tiger, but inside, he's a small-minded, mean snake.”

At that moment, Teacher Deoksoo’s eyes shone like a master hunter going tiger hunting.

But it wasn't long before his eyes softened again, like a kind grandfather.

“By the way, can we order jjajangmyeon here?”

“...?”

“They don’t deliver jjajangmyeon to Jirisan. I’ll have jjajang, you have jjamppong.”

Teacher Deoksoo was already picking up the intercom.

* * *

Giin (奇人).

A word that could describe Teacher Deoksoo. Even if you scoured the world, you wouldn't find such a unique individual.

In my past and present life, I had met countless people, but I could not fathom Teacher Deoksoo’s mind.

“The ribs are really tasty.”

“Please enjoy, Elder.”

“Then I won't hold back. Ma'am, could I have another bowl of rice?”

Not only had he become familiar with Grandfather, but he also used the house in Ichon-dong as if it were his own.

The housekeeper looked quite surprised, seeing the old man who had already finished three bowls of rice.

If she knew that he was nearing a hundred years old despite his robust appearance, she would be astonished.

“Elder, pardon me, but is it alright to be here like this? By now, Son Gangwook must be fully prepared. Rumors about you are already circulating in the stock market. They say a new chairman has appeared in Daeil Group.”

“Stock traders are always loose-lipped, then and now. And it wouldn’t just be them; the self-proclaimed king of the media, Kim Namcheon, must be on the move. He’s always been curious about me.”

“Kim Namcheon?”

“Yes, the reason why I lived as Teacher Deoksoo for twenty years was all because of him. He was so obsessed with me, even more than the military regime, as if I had run away with his money. In the end, he couldn’t find me and wasted his time. Tsk tsk.”

“Why was Kim Namcheon after you?”

“He wanted to elevate his fame and power, just like Son Gangwook. The rich always want more. But threatening the head of Daeil Group wouldn’t work, so he targeted Baek Gorae, who loved money. But Baek Gorae didn’t know my whereabouts, so he just wasted his money.”

Only then did I understand why Kim Namcheon had a connection with Baek Gorae of Gwangyang.

But I was also curious. Why would the cautious and cold-hearted Kim Namcheon search so desperately for Teacher Deoksoo? Did this old man really hold such immense power?

Then it happened.

“Burp, I ate well. The ribs here are really good. I’d like to eat two more bowls, but overeating at my age would cause problems.”

“Frankly, you’ve already overeaten.”

“Hey, what's overeating? When I was young, I could eat a whole cow in one sitting. By the way, Hyun, get ready to meet a noble person (貴人).”

“A noble person?”

“While living in Jirisan for twenty years, I studied fortune-telling and fate philosophy. You, Hyun, will meet a noble person today.”

What kind of nonsense was this?

Grandfather and I exchanged puzzled glances. Then the housekeeper approached and spoke to me.

“Kang Hyun, you have a visitor.”

Grandfather and I immediately looked at Teacher Deoksoo. However, he was nonchalantly licking the rib sauce off his fingers.

What on earth!

* * *

“So, Hyun is entangled in a major succession battle?”

The suddenly arrived noble person (貴人), Maestro Karas, quickly grasped the situation.

How did she understand the situation so well as a foreigner?

Teacher Deoksoo had explained the situation in fluent German. His German was so impeccable that one could mistake him for a native.

Grandfather looked worriedly at Teacher Deoksoo.

“Elder, with all due respect, is it alright to explain everything to Maestro Karas, whom you’ve just met?”

“You worry too much, just like his old friend. Since she came to see Hyun, it’s polite to explain this much. And, I'm not meeting the Maestro for the first time.”

“What?”

At that moment, Karas's eyes widened as if she had remembered something.

“Are you the Eastern audience who attended my performances? I thought you looked familiar.”

“Hoho. It’s a great honor that Maestro remembers this old man. I am a great fan of yours and, despite living anonymously, I always flew out to see your performances. I’m a fervent fan.”

“I remember you because you attended every performance. It’s been decades since you last attended the 1975 Berlin concert, but you’re still so vigorous. Truly amazing!”

Who would have thought that Teacher Deoksoo was a fervent fan of Maestro Karas?

Was his robust appearance despite his age due to being not youthful but rather having an old face that looked young?

“Maestro, you mentioned you have to leave Korea in a week, right?”

“Yes.”

“Then stay at the Ichon-dong house and rest for a week, and then go with Hyun.”

What was this? Was he suggesting that I leave for London without seeing the outcome of the Daeil Group situation?

I was curious about the Maestro's comeback stage, but the Daeil Group matters couldn't be set aside.

Then it happened.

“Tsk tsk. No matter how you look at it, Hyun, you were destined to succeed in business. But you also have heavenly luck in the arts, making the world's musicians envy you. I know what you’re worried about, but don’t worry about Daeil Group. A week is enough.”

“Elder, what do you mean?”

“If it were Son Ilseon who killed his father to take over Daeil Group, it wouldn’t end easily. Son Ilseon is formidable, even for me. But it’s Son Gangwook, so it’s fortunate. He wears a tiger’s mask but has a sinister nature. Unlike his straightforward and bold brother, he will choose a different path. He’ll end up drinking poison himself. The extraordinary general meeting has already been scheduled to expedite everything.”

“Please explain more simply!”

“Hmm. You seem smart, but sometimes you act clueless. I’ll explain simply. Son Gangwook thinks he’s in an unparalleled position, but he’s sitting in a trap. A very powerful trap that can take him down in one blow. But he thinks it’s great and sat down. Tsk tsk.”

Even the simple explanation was convoluted. Then it happened.

“Want me to make it easier?”

Of course. Teacher Deoksoo looked at me and added.
