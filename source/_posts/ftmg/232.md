"How much is this?" 

Im Hyera's eyes widened. It was because of the contract amount for the movie insert song that Kang Hyun had signed in the United States.

Jim Filmer's side had previously stated that they would determine the contract amount based on the quality of the first draft.

Usually, in the case of composers with no experience in Hollywood, the film company and investors would determine the contract amount based on the first draft.

However, the contract amount offered by Jim Filmer's side was beyond imagination.

"Mi-Hyun, how much was the contract for the composer who won the Best OST award at the Venice Film Festival?"

After hearing Kim Mi-Hyun's answer, Im Hyera looked at the contract again.

Kang Hyun's contract amount was already the highest among the off-the-record contract amounts circulating in Hollywood. This meant that director Jim Filmer was very pleased with Kang Hyun's music.

"CEO, not only director Jim Filmer but also director Michael from Hollywood, director Igor Bobchin, and even Sonyax Player, a leading company in the Japanese record market, have expressed strong interest in having Hyun compose music for them."

"Even Sonyax?"

"Yes, it seems that the first draft received by director Jim Filmer's side was leaked externally. It appears that the film company intentionally leaked it to boost the movie's popularity, but they didn't expect the feedback to come so quickly. Director Jim Filmer has personally called to apologize."

Im Hyera was speechless. Not only had Kang Hyun influenced famous Hollywood directors, but he had also impacted the Japanese record market.

She already knew that Kang Hyun had outstanding talent as a composer. However, she had mistakenly thought it was limited to classical music.

Who would have thought that he would demonstrate such remarkable talent in both popular music and commercial films?

"What kind of music did he create...?"

The quality of the first draft must have been so exceptional that the most prestigious galleries in the U.S. and Asia were contacting them. Kang Hyun had mentioned needing a studio, so they had set up the best studio in New York for him.

"CEO, we received a call from F.H. in New York. They asked if there are any plans for Hyun's concert in New York."

"F.H.?"

"It's the New York branch of Hyun's fan club (Forever Hyun). It's been only three months since it was established, but it has already gathered tens of thousands of members, even excluding Koreans. It seems that there are many female students who are not only classical music enthusiasts but also drawn to Hyun's appearance. They even make their own accessories (goods) with Hyun's photos."

Normally, this would have required legal procedures related to portrait rights. However, Im Hyera was too astonished.

Had there ever been a case where goods were produced for a classical musician? This was usually something reserved for top idol groups in Korea.

"We have announced that selling them legally is not allowed, but we couldn't stop the fan club members from wearing them on their own. We've even received many inquiries asking if we could make and sell the goods ourselves. The domestic F.H. also welcomes the idea of making and selling Hyun's goods with open arms."

Huh.

Im Hyera couldn't help but exclaim. She had never imagined that his popularity would be this high.

Frankly, if Kang Hyun wanted to, he could earn a massive amount of wealth through concerts and various merchandise sales. That's how popular and talented Kang Hyun was among the current classical stars.

* * *

"Hyun, we've arrived."

At the driver's words, Kang Hyun looked up and out the car window. It was the San Remo in Central Park.

One of the most expensive apartments representing New York, it was home to not only famous Hollywood figures but also business tycoons.

At the top of the massive co-op stood two towers modeled after the Lysicrates Monument, considered sacred by Broadway filmmakers and musicians.

Perhaps because of this, getting into San Remo, the most prestigious co-op, wasn't something money alone could achieve.

A famous anecdote was that in the 1980s, even the gold tycoon McCurtain and the Hollywood sex symbol Madonna were rejected despite offering a huge sum of money.

"Hyun, come in!"

Director Jim Filmer came running out as if he had been waiting for Kang Hyun with open arms.

The reason he wanted to meet Kang Hyun was simple. He was extremely pleased with the first draft.

Kang Hyun followed Jim Filmer's guidance and walked inside.

"Coffee? Tea? Whiskey?"

"Just a glass of orange juice, please."

Kang Hyun sipped the orange juice brought out by the housekeeper and looked around. It was indeed an apartment worthy of being called a Central Park landmark.

It was luxurious and elegant beyond comparison to most hotel suites. Now he understood why Madonna had been so desperate to move in.

"Hyun, how long will the second draft take?"

"Hmm."

"There's no need to rush. I can wait as long as it takes."

Kang Hyun hesitated. In fact, he had already completed the second draft but didn't feel the need to mention it here.

"Listening to the first draft you sent, I almost went mad with ecstasy. The fierce tones in the opening felt like someone was gripping and shaking my heart. The melody, reminiscent of a demon's touch, played the highlight of the unfilmed movie in my mind!"

Jim Filmer's lips quivered with excitement. The deep impression still gripped his entire being. If left unchecked, he seemed ready to go on about his impressions all night.

"Director, when do you plan to start filming?"

"Probably next spring, after all the actors' auditions are over and the set is complete. Honestly, I want to cast you as an actor, but I'd get an earful from Cameron if I did."

"Haha..."

Kang Hyun gave an awkward smile. Director James Cameron's proposal was still on hold. He was worried that appearing as a lead actor might negatively impact his future filmography.

After all, acting was not a talent he possessed, unlike music.

"Could you take a look at this script?"

"This?"

"It's the project I was originally considering for my next film. But since you are composing the insert song, the direction has completely changed. I think I'll work on it properly after this project. It's about a natural math genius."

As soon as Kang Hyun saw the script title, "The Heirs of Fermat," he recalled memories from his past life.

It was one of the most interesting works in Jim Filmer's filmography, which piqued his interest.

"You might find a lot to relate to, Hyun."

"Me?"

"I heard you're the first person in Korean history to get a perfect score on the SAT?"

Director Jim Filmer already knew all about Kang Hyun, including the fact that he was the first person to get a perfect score on Korea's college entrance exam.

Suddenly turned into a math genius, Kang Hyun put down the script after receiving excessive attention while reading it.

"I don't think this project is right for me."

"Why? Don't you like the content?"

"No, the script is really interesting. I'm not just giving lip service; its structure is as good as any masterpiece. But I can't come up with any musical ideas after reading this script. I'm sorry, Director."

For the thriller project Jim Filmer had previously commissioned, it was easier for Kang Hyun as he didn't know the work.

However, this project was a well-known masterpiece for Kang Hyun. Taking it on might make him unintentionally recall the original insert songs.

Jim Filmer regretfully licked his dry lips.

"By the way, Hyun, would you like to join us for dinner? My family will be arriving soon."

"Family?"

"We're having a garden party today. Not just my family, but also my in-laws will be coming. My nieces and nephews from Europe are particularly big fans of yours. You know you're incredibly popular in Europe to the point where racial discrimination doesn't even matter, right?"

Kang Hyun tilted his head, wondering if he was really that popular. In his past life, he hadn't been particularly popular with women. Given his nickname "The Stubborn One," it was understandable that he always had a sharp atmosphere.

But now, he had become a completely different person, with a bright demeanor and deep eyes that exuded a mysterious aura.

Still, Kang Hyun was unaware that his nickname was no longer "The Stubborn One" but "The Prince of Classical Music."

"He was a real genius!"

Cotton lit a cigarette and explained. Known for being a man of few words, he was unusually excited. The reason was simple: a few days ago, he had met a company that would provide massive investment support for his business.

Moreover, the CEO of the investment company was a natural genius in the field of nanotechnology, rivaling Cotton himself.

"Cotton, someone as genius as you?"

"The information he provided about nanotechnology is something only a natural genius could know. If he had majored in nanotechnology instead of running an investment company, I might have switched to another field due to his overwhelming genius!"

"What? Is that even possible?"

Cotton's girlfriend, Misha, couldn't believe it.

To Misha, her boyfriend Cotton was a genius among geniuses. He was so outstanding that he was famous even at MIT, where prodigies were known to thrive.

For him to praise someone so highly was something she had only heard when discussing the late Einstein. But anyway.

"Cotton, today is Uncle's garden party. Don't just talk about that CEO. Uncle is really curious about what you do!"

"Got it."

Cotton's face still looked dazed as if he were in a trance. If left unchecked, he would probably talk about the CEO for days.

As their conversation ended, the car arrived in front of San Remo in Central Park.

Getting a residence in this place was not guaranteed even for millionaires.

However, Misha's uncle was a famous director in Hollywood and had moved into this luxury apartment a few years ago.

When they reached the penthouse floor where the garden party was being held, Misha led the way, followed by Cotton. Misha greeted her uncle with a bright smile and a light hug.

"Uncle!"

"Misha!"

After the hug, Misha turned to introduce her boyfriend, Cotton. But Cotton's face was filled with astonishment.

What was going on? At that moment, Cotton looked incredulously at Kang Hyun, who was walking behind Jim Filmer.

"CEO Hyun?"
