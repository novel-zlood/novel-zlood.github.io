"Yooha's boyfriend?"

Son Kangwook looked at me with a curious gaze.

"Wow, you look much more handsome in person than on TV. I can see why our cold niece is so fond of Kang Hyun. You're much more impressive than most idols."

Son Kangwook approached with a firm step and extended his thick palm for a handshake. Contrary to expectations, he turned out to be quite a gentle person.

"Hello, I am Kang Hyun."

"Oh my, look at me. I'm Yooha's uncle, Son Kangwook."

His demeanor was completely different from his first impression. The fierce warrior seemed to have disappeared, replaced by a simple smile that made him look like a robust farmer from the countryside.

"Kang Hyun, it seems my sister-in-law hasn't arrived at the gallery yet. If you have time, could you give me a tour of the gallery?"

"A tour of the gallery?"

"Yes, even though I'm Yooha's uncle, this is my first visit here since it's not a place one can easily come to. Hahaha."

Son Kangwook smiled sheepishly. In retrospect, the number of times the owner family of the Daeil Group visited the gallery was quite low. Only influential figures like Chairman Wang or Son Ilsung dared to visit.

"Alright, I'll show you around."

They say even a dog recites poetry after three years in a schoolyard. I've been working on music in the studio provided by the Daeil Gallery for years now.

By now, I'm so familiar with the inside of the building that I could navigate it with my eyes closed, and I probably know the history of most of the artworks better than Kim Mihyun.

"A shadow in the storm, it's a very profound and magnificent work. I feel like buying it right now. Do you know how much this piece costs, Kang Hyun?"

He indeed had a good eye for art. It's a work by David Hawkins that represents the pinnacle of 20th-century modern art. Its price is among the highest in the gallery.

"I believe it's around three billion won."

Modern art is often priced at whatever one is willing to pay. For example, the value of a piece increases over time. There was no better investment than this. At that moment,

"What!?"

"Yes?"

"Is it really that expensive? I thought it was only a few hundred thousand won. It's not even made of gold, yet it's more expensive than most buildings. If it weren't for you, Kang Hyun, I would've thought it was a joke!"

Son Kangwook's eyes widened in shock. He genuinely didn't know the price.

I couldn't understand it. One would think that a member of a conglomerate family would have studied art as part of social education from a young age.

"Haha, I disliked art since I was a child."

At that moment, Son Kangwook elaborated as if he had read my mind.

He continued to look at "A Shadow in the Storm" with amazement, muttering to himself, "Three billion?" "Is this really three billion?" and laughed in disbelief.

It was understandable. For an ordinary person with no interest in art, it might seem that way. But Son Kangwook was not an ordinary person; he was a second-generation chaebol.

"Executive Director."

At that moment, someone who appeared to be Son Kangwook's secretary hurriedly whispered something in his ear. Son Kangwook nodded and turned to me with a simple smile.

"Kang Hyun, it seems we have to end our meeting here today. My sister-in-law has arrived at the gallery. If I'm late, she might not even let me in. Thank you so much for showing me around despite your busy schedule."

"No problem. I enjoyed it as well."

"Hahaha, then let's meet again next time."

Son Kangwook gave a short nod and turned away. At that moment, his gait changed again.

* * *

"It's been a while."

A heavy atmosphere lingered. Chairwoman Im Hyera knew that the person sitting in front of her was the most dangerous figure in the Daeil Group.

"I didn't expect Executive Director Son Kangwook to visit the gallery suddenly. If you had informed me in advance, I would have come to greet you."

"Sister-in-law, are you still calling me by my title so coldly? It's my first time at the gallery, and I saw many expensive artworks. I bet the 'real' ones are piled up in the basement, not the 'fake' ones on the ground floor."

Chairwoman Im Hyera's brows furrowed. Son Kangwook was one of the people who knew the most secrets within the Daeil Group. In some ways, he was even more cunning than Chairman Son Jangwon, his father.

"Sister-in-law, I'll get straight to the point. Hand over the circumstantial evidence related to the accounting fraud at Daeil Electronics to the prosecution."

"What are you talking about!"

"Do you think I don't know that the Daeil Foundation has been secretly covering up the accounting fraud at Daeil Electronics? The Daeil Gallery and Daeil Foundation are practically connected by the same string, so you, the owner, must know best."

Son Kangwook's eyes resembled those of a tiger. His firmly closed lips and deep eyes beneath thick eyebrows exuded confidence.

Even someone who didn't know how to read faces could describe his presence as that of a tiger.

"Executive Director Son Kangwook, even if such evidence exists, do you think I would hand it over?"

"Why not?"

"Pardon?"

Son Kangwook downed a hot cup of coffee in one gulp and began to speak.

"It's disgustingly hot."

"What are you trying to do?"

"If you don't hand over the circumstantial evidence related to the accounting fraud, I will expose all the corruption of the Daeil Foundation and gallery. It would be like burning down your house to catch a flea, but if you continue to be uncooperative, I have no choice. Let me list some of the corrupt activities of the Daeil Foundation and gallery."

As time passed, Chairwoman Im Hyera's eyes widened. She never imagined that Son Kangwook would know so many secrets of the Daeil Foundation. It was then that she realized why her husband, Son Ilsung, was so wary of him.

"Even if you hand over the circumstantial evidence of the accounting fraud, your capable husband will be in jail for at most a month. I think that's a very cheap price to pay. I'll give you three days. If you don't make a decision or try any tricks, I'll take action first."

Son Kangwook smiled faintly and stood up. He even joked that there was no need for a farewell.

Chairwoman Im Hyera could only sit there like a stone Buddha. As Son Kangwook walked away, he muttered to himself.

"Everything will be over in a month."

"Did Son Kangwook visit the Daeil Gallery?"

Grandfather's face was full of seriousness. It seemed like a big issue had arisen just because Son Kangwook visited the gallery.

"Why are you so worried, Grandfather?"

Grandfather hesitated for a moment, then finally spoke with dry lips.

"Hyun, do you know why Chairman Son chose President Son Ilsung as his successor?"

"Isn't it because he's the most capable among his children?"

"No. The most capable among Chairman Son's children was none other than his second son, Son Kangwook. In fact, when his children were young, Chairman Son secretly considered Son Kangwook as the heir to the Daeil Group."

It was a story I had never heard before. I couldn't believe that Chairman Wang had considered Son Kangwook as his successor instead of Son Ilsung. But since it was my grandfather, Chairman Wang's lifelong friend, telling me, it had to be true.

"But Chairman Son distanced himself once he realized Son Kangwook's hidden nature."

"Hidden nature?"

"Unlike President Son Ilsung, Son Kangwook is a man of great ambition. He would use any means necessary to get what he wants. While President Son Ilsung aims to expand the Daeil Group globally, Son Kangwook would sell the Daeil Group to realize his ambition."

Now I understood Chairman Wang's choice. The Daeil Group was his lifelong achievement. The Daeil Group was Chairman Wang, and Chairman Wang was the Daeil Group.

President Son Ilsung inherited and expanded the Daeil Group globally, while Son Kangwook would sell it for his ambition. Making Son Kangwook the successor would be like entrusting a cat with a fish.

"Son Kangwook must be the one who reported Daeil Electronics to the prosecution. I'm worried. If Chairman Son were healthy, he could have prevented this."

Grandfather had spent half his life with Chairman Wang. His face was full of concern for Chairman Wang.

"As soon as Chairman Son collapsed, Son Kangwook began to reveal his ambition as if it were planned. What are we to do?"

* * *

There were many suspicious aspects. As Grandfather said, as soon as Chairman Wang collapsed, President Son Ilsung was arrested.

Even the prosecution couldn't have arrested a powerful figure from the Daeil Group so quickly. It looked like a well-prepared script.

"Kang Hyun, we've arrived."

With the help of driver Kim, I arrived at the Pyeongchang-dong mansion. The reason I didn't drive myself was that I had a lot on my mind.

"For various reasons, I am deeply entangled with the Daeil Group in this life as well."

In my past life, I struggled to become a Daeil Group scholar. Back then, I chased wealth and power, becoming a dog of the Daeil Group.

But now things were different. This life was intertwined in complex relationships. Not only was I close with Chairman Wang, but I also couldn't just stand by because of my relationship with Son Yooha.

"The future can change."

For instance, my grandfather's extended lifespan.

In my past life, there was no such turmoil in the Daeil Group. If there had been, I, who was very interested in the Daeil Group scholarship during my university days, would have remembered.

"Kang Hyun?"

The housekeeper at the Pyeongchang-dong mansion looked at me with surprised eyes. But she didn't block my way. The bodyguards didn't either. In fact, I had visited the Pyeongchang-dong mansion more times than Chairman Wang's children.

"I came to see Chairman Wang."

"What should we do? The Chairman is still unconscious."

"It's fine. May I see him for a moment?"

I had already contacted Chairwoman Im Hyera before coming. The housekeeper also contacted Chairwoman Im Hyera and, after getting permission, guided me to Chairman Wang's bedroom.

Beep beep beep beep.

The sound of machines checking vital signs echoed in the bedroom.

Chairman Wang looked like he was in a deep sleep, with his eyes gently closed. It seemed like he might wake up and scold us at any moment.

"Grandfather."

I called out, but there was no response. Yooha, who was abroad, must also be very worried. I had come to the Pyeongchang-dong mansion looking for clues, but I couldn't find any by Chairman Wang's side. However, my suspicion turned into certainty.

"It was Son Kangwook."

The meticulousness of the plan made it clear who the culprit was. Veteran Kim Namcheon wouldn't have allied with Son Kangwook for no reason.

At that moment,

Huh?

Chairman Wang's finger moved. It was as if he had been waiting for my arrival.
