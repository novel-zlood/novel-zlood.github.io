The sound of galloping hooves echoed like a series of triplets.

Long fingers moved across the keys, as if watching a spider at dusk.

The sinister, piercing melody continued like the whisper of a devil, and the pianist's mouth began to burn with thirst.

Every time his shoulders shook, it seemed as if the voice of the demon king unfolded from his fingertips.

A strong high note, like a spring being released, reached the ceiling.

“Hoo—!”

Baek Jeonghun exhaled the breath he had been holding back. It felt like he was continuously thirsty, as if he were walking on a dry desert.

The reason for the hoarse sound escaping his dry lips was different. It was because the unknown cantata kept echoing in his mind like a reverberation.

“Jeonghun-ssi, do you have a moment?”

At that moment, Director Im Hyera found Baek Jeonghun.

“A broadcasting program?”

“Yes, Jeonghun-ssi, you appeared on a talk show before, right? It seems that your appearance was quite well-received by the TV producers.”

After the financial crisis, the number of students aspiring to be sports stars and learning baseball and golf increased. Moreover, the number of students aiming for classical music also increased quite a bit. It was clear who was the cause.

“But will Hyun do well in England? Some journalists have already figured out why Hyun went to England. Although no articles have been published yet, there’s already a buzz among music journalists about the possibility of Hyun conducting for the royal family.”

It was no exaggeration to say that the journalists were in a frenzy. Rather, it was quiet to this extent because Director Im Hyera was backing them. The significance of the British royal performance in the classical music world was that immense.

Furthermore, the chosen conductor would be handling the London Symphony, wouldn’t they?

“America's Miles, Europe's Matthew, and decisively, even China's Shu. They must be formidable conductors.”

Director Im Hyera's face was full of concern. It was because the conductors Maestro Spencer had selected as candidates were all formidable talents.

Ordinary people might not know, but all three had won international competitions and were next-generation maestros. Moreover, China's Shu had already conducted major orchestras multiple times.

“I have already collaborated with Mr. Shu.”

“Really?”

“He was an extraordinary conductor, recognized as a next-generation maestro in China. He excelled not only in commanding numerous musicians but also in interpreting the music. I believe the other conductors are just as remarkable as Mr. Shu. Whether someone is chosen or not is not the important issue. But.”

How would he compare to Kang Hyun? Baek Jeonghun thought of Kang Hyun's symphony, sweeping his dry lips.

He had never felt this way about any other score before. But as soon as he received Kang Hyun's symphony, he felt a chill run through his body.

It was a thirst that even Schubert's "Erlkönig" couldn't quench. Just as he had felt the burning thirst.

“London will definitely choose Hyun.”

* * *

Suddenly, he thought of a triumphant general. He saw the musicians swaying like reeds in the spring breeze.

Kang Hyun walked confidently onto the concert hall stage. The young conductors' faces were full of puzzlement.

But Spencer's blue eyes were brimming with deep curiosity.

“Emanuel, please make the beginning of the second movement lower and eerier. For example, express the melody as if it were a scream. More earnest than the dynamic markings on the staff. The mezzo-soprano playing the role of the wood pigeon and the bass-baritone playing the role of the farmer will be filled in by Chloe and Michael.”

Someone once said that Schoenberg's "Gurrelieder" surpassed Mahler and Strauss in complexity and difficulty of instrumentation and scale and exceeded Wagner in the intensity of romantic expression.

It was a symphony rarely performed. Not just because of its large scale but because the score seemed to push the conductor's abilities to the limit, earning it a reputation as an unplayable piece.

“Michael, you said you struck the ground with a hammer instead of a snare drum in Mahler's Symphony No. 6. It's the same now. We'll use that method.”

Even renowned conductors had been at a loss for words at the difficulty of the score. But Kang Hyun gave directions to the musicians without hesitation, as if the full score was imprinted in his mind.

He even went a step further and improvised an arrangement on the spot. As Kang Hyun's voice continued, the pupils of the young conductors shook as if an earthquake had occurred.

“Dmitri, when I signal, you and the associate concertmaster will play the solo parts. Both of you will play the same piece, but with different bow directions. The lack of harps will be compensated by the flute. When I point out sections to you, don't think of Schoenberg's score but of Mozart's concertos and rearrange the score. The flute will add rich and varied melodies while the harp leads the melody.”

It was as if he had thoroughly prepared for this day from the beginning. Kang Hyun's directions were that confident.

China's Shu wondered if he could do the same. Just because he had worked with the musicians before didn't mean he could give such precise directions.

Furthermore, the highbrow musicians of the London Symphony, known for their lofty musical values, were listening to Kang Hyun's directions as if they were from a maestro.

“I'm sorry, but I'll also change the placement of the instruments.”

Spencer had already seated himself in the audience.

On stage, the musicians were moving their stands and instruments in perfect synchronization with Kang Hyun's directions.

Kang Hyun also didn't forget to offer detailed advice to the moving musicians.

Schoenberg's "Gurrelieder" was a grand epic. Its large scale and seemingly endless length made it a piece that musicians dreaded.

Yet, Kang Hyun seemed to know every single measure without missing a beat.

Impossible.

For a moment, a hypothesis crossed Shu's mind, but he shook his head. He thought Maestro Spencer had informed Kang Hyun of the audition piece in advance, but that was just a baseless worry. The excitement and curiosity in Maestro's eyes were genuine and couldn't be faked.

At that moment.

“Maestro, we are ready.”

Kang Hyun looked at the audience. His gaze was so calm that it seemed as if he had accomplished something trivial.

However, the musicians' eyes were filled with tension. They hadn't expected such detailed and numerous instructions.

Given the circumstances, it felt as if the roles in the audition had been reversed.

When Spencer gave a brief nod, Kang Hyun smiled faintly and stepped onto the podium.

As his shoulders moved, holding the baton, the young conductors' throats bobbed prominently. It was the moment when Schoenberg's song was reborn at Kang Hyun's fingertips.

* * *

A serene silence permeated the audience. In the empty seats of the concert hall sat three conductors.

Though they looked entirely different, they shared one thing in common: unfocused eyes. They seemed like people who had witnessed something unbelievable.

Even though Kang Hyun's conducting had ended, the three couldn't rise from their seats as if by an unspoken agreement.

“How could that be?”

America's Miles muttered incredulously. Europe’s Matthew and China’s Shu couldn't help but agree.

Kang Hyun's conducting was flawless. Not only did he rearrange the grand epic, but he also placed the necessary instruments in the right spots.

His ability to interpret the piece was outstanding, and even more surprising was.

“His command was truly remarkable.”

Just as Matthew said, his ability to command the stage was unparalleled. It made one question whether he had truly learned conducting for such a short time.

Shu thought of master players on a Go board when he looked at Kang Hyun. It was impossible to gauge how many moves he had planned.

Like the Go proverb, ‘Question every move,’ Kang Hyun had already seen through the orchestra as if looking down at a Go board.

“It seems like he has a giant orchestra in his mind. Otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense for him to rearrange the score and reposition the instruments so perfectly in such a short time. Miles, have you ever seen a conductor like that in America?”

“Not at all. I've never met or heard of such a conductor in any American orchestra. Besides, American orchestras, which prioritize direct interpretation over nuance, wouldn’t accept such an arrangement. I never imagined he would use the timpani that way. He revived Schoenberg in the most extraordinary manner.”

Miles and Matthew expressed pure admiration. Though they did nothing in the first audition, they didn’t feel bad at all. Instead, their eyes were filled with excitement.

The boy they thought was just a violinist stood tall as a conductor. It could be described as a competitive spirit towards a talented opponent.

“Shu, what do you think?”

China's Shu didn’t respond and stood up. Known for his sensitive and proud nature, it wasn't surprising that he didn't engage in conversation.

However, as he turned away, Shu left one final comment.

“Zhi shì wán měi de zhǐ huī (It was a perfect conduct).”

* * *

In a way, it could be said that he was lucky. One of the pieces he studied while composing his first symphony was Schoenberg's "Gurrelieder." It was a piece for soloists, chorus, and orchestra.

Studying Schoenberg's score in the studio and running countless simulations in his mind also helped.

It was like a math problem he had practiced for the SAT appearing as a subjective question.

“Kris, did you find out who owns the mansion I asked about?”

“If you mean the mansion in the suburbs, it belongs to the Chinese company, Jinwang Group.”

“Jinwang Group?”

It was unexpected. He had heard of Jinwang Group before. It was one of those places that couldn’t be left out when discussing Guanxi in China. Though not at the very top of China, it was like the horn of a dragon.

Moreover, it was memorable because its owner was unusually a woman.

The reason the eldest daughter became the owner was simple. Recalling past memories, the eldest son had died young.

“This place?”

“It’s Good River, which Kris recommended. I came here with Yooha before, and it was quite delicious. Today, it's my treat.”

Technically, he had first come here with his wife in his previous life, but he kept that to himself. The dinner at Good River with Yooha was so delicious that it made him forget even past memories.

Moreover, he owed Kris a debt. When he rode in Wang Chun’s car to Jinwang Group's mansion from the airport, Kris had thought he was kidnapped.

Had he called a bit later, he might have encountered Kris roaming London's streets with a handgun.

“Hyun, it was a very delicious dinner.”

“Let’s have dinner together occasionally. It’s a bit lonely eating alone at the hotel. If it’s okay, it might be nice to eat with the musicians too. Do you remember the harpist, Ellis? He was glancing at you. I noticed it last time, but I was sure this time.”

Kris, who seemed like she could chew through iron, blushed shyly. It was as if the Terminator was embarrassed.

They were walking through Canary Wharf to aid digestion.

“Kris.”

“Hyun, I feel it too. There’s only one person, so follow me closely without making it obvious.”

A strong gaze was felt from somewhere. I wasn’t the only one who sensed something strange.

Like a Sherpa on Everest, Kris expertly guided us through the alleys of Canary Wharf. Her face, which looked ready for any mishap, was like a Terminator again.

“Now.”

Kris shoved me into an alley and took a stance.

A mysterious figure following closely was grabbed by Kris’s strong hand and lifted defenselessly against the wall.

It looked like a scene from a superhero movie as the figure floated in the air. At that moment.

Huh?

“Kris, wait—!”

I urgently shouted as Kris was about to throw a punch. The eyes of the man pinned against the wall were filled with surprise.

He was someone I had met before. It was China’s Shu, wasn’t it?

Shu, caught in Kris’s grip, dropped his head and spoke briefly in response to our questioning gazes.

“I want to learn.”

“What?”

I didn’t understand. If he wanted to learn, he should find Maestro Spencer, not follow me.

Moreover, from his perspective, I was a competitor. Just then, Shu bit his lip and added.

“Hyun, I want to learn conducting from you.”
