"Again."

His uplifted eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and hooked nose still gave off a harsh impression. Far from dulling with the passage of time, they had sharpened even more, truly earning him the nickname "Demon of Moscow."

Such a moniker likely stemmed from his relentless obsession with melody. It's no wonder that Alexei, the director of the Moscow Music Conservatory, was often called the reincarnation of Tchaikovsky. Though, unlike the reportedly introverted Tchaikovsky, Alexei was the complete opposite.

"Again."

A short but firm voice.

"Again."

The violinist's arm trembled like a leaf, but Alexei nonchalantly lifted his teacup. Historically, it was rare for the conservatory director to personally instruct undergraduates, making this the second time since the founding director Tchaikovsky had taught harmony over a hundred years ago.

"Stop."

The teacup was placed down with a sound.

"The cheeky kid already made music with his name on it. I wondered what he was doing holed up after rejecting offers from Berlin and London. It's a damn shame he doesn't perform on stage, but his talent is unmistakable after listening to his recordings. This is why I dislike geniuses."

Anyone else would have been astounded by such words. Alexei was a maestro of Russia, combining outstanding talent with years of experience. Indeed, which living musician from Moscow wouldn't pay him respect?

At that moment.

"But Anna, what have you been doing for the past two years?"

Thin lips were bitten tightly.

"I thought you would surpass Andrei."

Violinist Andrei was known as the next great master of Russia. Interest in him within the Russian classical music scene was immense. He was the youngest winner of the Queen Elisabeth Competition until Kang Hyun appeared, so there's no need to further discuss his illustrious career.

"Artistic talent isn't something you learn from someone. Music is the same. If music could be mastered just by learning, then everyone taught by Joseph Joachim and Leopold Auer would have become a maestro. Anna, you probably think you've hit your limit. But that's just fools mistaking their inability to break their own walls as a limit."

Alexei spoke passionately, rising from his seat. At that moment,

Bzzz—!

The bow was lifted again. The sharp melody stopped his steps, and Alexei, who seemed incapable of smiling, twitched his cheek.

The frail, sickly-looking girl from two years ago was no more. Her platinum blonde hair fluttered, and her green eyes followed the strings like looking at a beautiful white rose.

At that moment, the great maestro of Russia, Alexei, knew instinctively.

That this nineteen-year-old girl would eventually surpass Andrei.

Spiro Spiro buzz buzz—!

The morning was so chaotic it was almost disorienting. Just as I was about to sit in my workshop to compose, Mi-hyun noona kept knocking on the door.

The reason was obvious. After my solo performance revealed that I was Baek Jung-hoon's 'teacher' and the composer of 'Iron Blood,' things had been hectic.

Requests for interviews came in daily, and reporters even visited the gallery, so it's understandable that Mi-hyun noona's face looked distressed.

Moreover, the fact that I sat between the two founders was widely talked about. All this stemmed from that event planned by Baek Jung-hoon.

How did the two grandfathers react?

Of course, my grandfather was very proud of me. On the other hand, the crafty old man insisted that 'Iron Blood' was exactly his style and even asked me to compose the anthem for Daeil Group.

Who would have thought the legendary chairman would make such a request? But did he think I'd go back to proclaiming the anthem for Daeil Group?

"Hyun, are you working?"

Just then, Im Hyera, the director, came to visit me. It seemed to be around lunchtime. I discreetly pushed aside the sheet music I had been composing.

"Why hasn't Jung-hoon been coming to the workshop lately?"

Since the solo performance, Baek Jung-hoon had stopped his daily visits to the workshop as if it were a lie. He must be busy preparing for regional solo performances.

But if Baek Jung-hoon were to show up at the workshop, I would tie him to the piano chair and coach him all day. He would have to pay the price for organizing such an outrageous event.

"There’s a huge fuss in Japan. It seems Japanese reporters also attended Jung-hoon's solo performance. They've been pestering me day and night, asking if you plan to release a classical album under your name. And EMA also contacted us, strongly requesting to release an album you wrote."

Im Hyera director clicked her tongue. No wonder, as EMA was one of the most prestigious classical labels in Europe.

While Japan did hold a significant share of the classical music market, it was said that they couldn't compare to the European powerhouses.

Rumors spread fast, and it seemed Baek Jung-hoon's 'Iron Blood' had created an immense sensation in the classical music world.

"Jean-Pierre seems to be getting anxious too. He thought you’d contact him soon, but you haven’t responded. I'm worried he might come to Korea again, like last time. It looks like he's planning to improve the contract terms."

"Is it that serious?"

It would be a simultaneous recording like before, but why is he so eager to work with me?

Though Paganini's techniques are challenging, Europe is full of excellent violinists. How could the offer include running royalties and improved contract terms? Even though I don't know much about the film industry, these conditions seem unprecedented.

"Oh, did I not tell you?"

Tell me what?

"Jean-Pierre, once he gets attached, he digs in until the end. His nickname is 'stubborn as a bull.' He’ll wait until you say okay."

I was receiving love calls from everywhere.

In my past life, I chased after power and greed, but now, opportunities came to me even while I stayed still. Moreover, everyone claimed they were accommodating me.

At that moment, the sheet music on the desk slid to the floor. "Crafty old man? The title of the sheet music is interesting, Hyun?"

Director Im Hyera picked up the sheet music with a puzzled expression.

Ahem,

Who would have known that crafty old man would offer a massive composition fee?

Moreover, he was determined to tempt me by promising legendary instruments like Guarneri and Amati, which are hard to obtain even in auctions.

It was a win-win situation. Business should be handled separately from personal matters.

"You rascal, do you just play Go every day after eating?"

The chairman stared intently at the Go board. His furrowed brows made him look like a veteran about to enter a war. But it's not like new moves would suddenly appear out of nowhere.

"You’re composing as well, right?"

"Who would dare refuse you? Please don’t worry."

Of course, I had been dedicated to the Daeil Group anthem for several days. The only memories related to Daeil Group were from my past life, so it took a lot of effort to squeeze out some inspiration.

But it's all good. Just prepare those legendary instruments, crafty old man.

"By the way, as you said, the domino effect has started. But it seems the government is trying to stop it somehow. At this rate, it might not turn out as you predicted. They're signing bailout agreements and even trying to save dying financial companies."

Even so, it was like performing CPR. Despite providing massive financial aid to near-bankrupt financial companies, the capital market was already drying up.

The government's response was not just one step but several steps too late.

"Pouring water into a bottomless pit won't fill it."

Despite announcing stock market support measures, stock prices continued to fall. Financial debt was increasing day by day with the bankruptcy of large companies. They were trying to hold on with bailout agreements, special loans, and settlements, but it was clear they would eventually collapse.

The truth was gradually being revealed like peeling an onion.

The chairman raised his white eyebrows at my calm demeanor. It was a habit of his when he was pleased with something.

Clack—

"Do you feel good about going all out against an elderly person? Didn’t your grandfather always tell you to respect your elders?"

"Grandfather, you've already taken three of my stones?"

"What if your grandfather collapses from high blood pressure due to your fierce moves?"

Who could call the crafty old man elderly? He was exceptionally fit for his age, and lately, he was eating anything considered good for health.

A few weeks ago, there was a rumor that the Daeil Group bought a 300-year-old wild ginseng found by a herb gatherer in Jirisan.

"Your grandfather must live long enough to see your wedding, Hyun."

The crafty old man's eyes were somehow sharp, but I pretended not to notice and fiddled with the white stones.

"Hyun, next time you go to Pyeongchang-dong, take some soy sauce marinated crabs. Chairman Son likes the ones your mother makes."

Dinner was a table showcasing my mother's culinary skills to the fullest.

Especially the soy sauce marinated crabs were so delicious that even my grandfather, who usually struggled to finish one bowl of rice, ate two bowls in a row.

Even the crafty old man, who had tasted all kinds of delicacies, couldn't resist my mother's soy sauce marinated crabs, so there's no need to say more.

Should I suggest to my mother to start a soy sauce marinated crab business?

"After dinner, I’d like Kang Hyun to come to the study for a talk about the Russian matter."

Russia?

"And Hyun, you come too."

I looked at my grandfather with a questioning gaze, but he gave no answer. My father seemed to know something but remained silent.

Anyway, once dinner was over, we would naturally find out. Now was the time to focus on the soy sauce marinated crabs. Otherwise, they would soon be gone.

"Mr. Kang, did you receive a proposal from the Moscow Chemical Research Institute?"

After finishing dinner, I headed to my grandfather's study with my father.

"Yes, sir. They proposed collaborating on the commercialization of Graphene. It seems they want us to scout them. They have a good research team but poor conditions."

I could see it without looking. Various research institutes were sending love calls for the commercialization of Graphene.

However, most of them were just testing the waters.

"The head of the research institute contacts us almost daily, so it's a bit troublesome on our side. We’ve never received such urgent contact before."

The prevailing opinion in the chemical field was that the commercialization of Graphene was nearly impossible.

"What's the name of the lead researcher?"

"Dr. Vladimir Tikhonov, known as an eccentric in the Russian chemical field."

I almost jumped out of my seat. Was the software much better now? Memories from my past life flashed back as if I were pulling out books from a vast library.

If my memory served me right, Dr. Vladimir Tikhonov was the same name as the key figure who had played a significant role in the commercialization of Graphene after Dongju was absorbed by foreign capital in my past life.

Of course, it could just be a coincidence, but it was worth a shot.

"How about meeting the doctor?"

My sudden suggestion made my grandfather and father turn their heads.

"I heard geniuses in that field tend to be more capable the more eccentric they are. If they want us that badly, it means they have confidence."

When I gave a roundabout answer, my father looked puzzled. However, my grandfather seemed satisfied and nodded.

"Yes, as Hyun said, if they are that desperate to find us, we should at least meet them. We also need to understand the actual state of the research institute in Moscow. We’ll know if it's empty or not once we see for ourselves. Mr. Kang, will you go to Moscow for this business trip?"

My father looked surprised by the sudden decision.

"And Hyun, you go too. Think of it as a father-son trip after a long time."

Me too?

I was suddenly included in the trip to Moscow. It seemed my grandfather had already made up his mind.

If I suddenly left, Jean-Pierre would pester Im Hyera director for a long time. Anyway, the basic principle of a deal is pushing and pulling, so it wouldn't be bad.

But Moscow, somehow, one side of my cheek felt warm.

-Please visit Moscow someday!
