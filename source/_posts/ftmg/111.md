"Got it―!"

The cello's melody bounced like a spring, reflecting the throbbing heart of the performer.

"Emmanuel, what's making you so happy?"

Dmitri, the concertmaster of the London Symphony, looked at Emmanuel with a puzzled expression.

It wasn't just Emmanuel. The faces of the other members were also flushed with an inexplicable hue.

At that moment, Emmanuel made a significant expression, stopped playing, and held up three fingers.

"Dmitri, there have been exactly three times in my life when I've fought the hardest. First, when I was born from my mother's womb. Second, when I auditioned to join the London Symphony. And the third was just yesterday at dawn, trying to get tickets for Hyun's solo concert."

"What! Hyun's solo concert?"

His voice was so surprised that even his cold eyes seemed to ripple.

"Dmitri, you didn't know?"

After all, it was a solo concert being held far away. Dmitri, who lived as if he had built a wall with the media, couldn't have known. He practiced violin all day, so it was understandable.

"It's a solo concert in Asia, so Hyun probably didn't think of us. And it's his first solo concert, so he must be out of his mind. The members who have free time decided to go to Korea together to see Hyun's solo concert."

"Then I should book a ticket too."

"They said it's already sold out. All the seats were gone in an hour."

Dmitri showed a bewildered expression. He couldn't believe all the seats were sold out in an hour.

He thought it might be a solo concert held in a small concert hall, but when he heard it was at the Seoul Arts Center concert hall, where the London Symphony had performed, he couldn't help but exclaim.

Even the London Symphony didn't take half a day to fill the 2,500 seats.

At that moment.

"The maestro has arrived."

The door of the practice room opened, and Spencer, the conductor of the London Symphony, entered. Even Spencer, who always maintained a poker face, had a slight smile on his lips. Dmitri stood up in astonishment.

"Dmitri, are you free next week?"

"Pardon? Maestro?"

"We have to go to Korea together. There's going to be an amazing performance there. Ah, I've already booked the tickets, so don't worry."

At that moment, an unmistakable smile spread across Dmitri's face.

* * *

"Welcome."

As the door of the photo studio opened, an elderly photographer bowed politely.

When the photographer lifted his bowed head, his face showed clear signs of surprise.

No wonder, as unexpected foreigners had entered the old photo studio at the corner of the alley.

"Hyun, what is this place? Weren't we going to a restaurant?"

Eric from Northern Europe rubbed his sleepy eyes and looked around the photo studio. It must have been because of jet lag that he felt drowsy.

"I thought it would be nice to capture some memories. When I thought about it, we didn't have a single photo taken together at the chapel."

Taking pictures with a film camera would have been nice, but the old photo studio had its own charm.

After all, these were friends who had come all the way to Korea for my solo concert. They might not realize it now, but years later, the fact that our old memories were captured in photos would be an irreplaceable happiness.

"Grandfather, please speak comfortably. I'll translate for you."

"Then, please move that big young man a little to the side. And the pretty young lady, please come a little more to the center."

The photographer nodded and adjusted the positions. Especially because of the big Eric, he had to change the composition several times.

At first, the photographer was very tense, but as time passed, he returned to his professional self.

"Everyone, please smile."

Anyone would think we were filming a slapstick comedy. Everyone had an awkward smile plastered on their faces.

I was no different. I had never taken a photo with friends gathered like this in my past life.

"Aren't we supposed to shout something when taking a picture? Like 'For Hyun's solo concert!'"

"Eric, we are not at a pub drinking beer. We are at a photo studio."

Finally, a natural smile formed. With a click, the photo was taken. The photographer's face was full of a satisfied smile.

Although we could only get the photo two days later, the moment was already etched as a memory in the hearts of the friends.

"As expected, I was right."

With the help of Mr. Kim, the chauffeur, we entered Ichon-dong.

Seeing the complex of country houses with walls rising like a fortress, William nodded.

Seeing my puzzled look, Zhang Yan explained next to me.

"There was a rumor when Hyun was in Brussels. They said Hyun was a disciple taught by famous maestros from Asia gathered together. Another rumor was that Hyun was the heir of the royal family. Looking at this neighborhood that resembles Beverly Hills, the latter seems more credible."

Of course, the house in Ichon-dong was a rare mansion in the 90s.

"Well, I know another rumor."

At that moment, Anna made a playful expression and looked back and forth between me and William. William coughed awkwardly and looked out the car window.

"We've arrived."

At Mr. Kim's words, everyone turned their attention to the mansion in Ichon-dong.

As we walked across the garden, grandfather and my parents came out to greet us. They must have been grateful to the friends who had come all the way from overseas for me.

Grandfather warmly greeted each friend, holding their hands, looking like a general of a military division.

"Hyun looks a lot like your grandfather."

Anna whispered to me in a small voice.

I look like grandfather? I had never thought about it.

"You have deep eyes just like him. When you get older, you'll probably have a dignified look like your grandfather."

"Anna, I'm still a high school student. Are you already imagining me as an old man?"

"Hyun always feels like an oppa to me."

Even though her appearance had become more ladylike, her personality was no different from three years ago.

It was understandable that Anna saw me as an oppa. I even made funny faces to ease her tension before performances.

At that moment.

"Oppa―!"

Son Yooha was waiting for me at the entrance. But as she looked at Anna, who followed me, her expression hardened.

Noticing this, William made a quick remark.

"It's going to be a fiery dinner."

"What? Is it a barbecue dinner tonight?"

Eric added belatedly, flaring his nostrils.

* * *

"A ghost?"

The dining table quickly heated up.

"The nickname for Hyun in Moscow was 'Little Ghost.'"

Anna started telling stories as if she had learned the art of storytelling without my knowledge.

She was talking about episodes that happened at the Moscow Conservatory. Although she was speaking in English, everyone understood. Of course, I translated for my mother separately.

"One of the professors was convinced that Tchaikovsky's ghost was moving. When they realized at the inauguration that Hyun was not a ghost but a living person, the undergraduates were so surprised. And on the days Hyun gave lectures in the main auditorium, there wasn't a single ant in the hallways of the Moscow Conservatory."

"This kid gave lectures?"

"Yes, grandfather. Hyun gave lectures in the main auditorium, attended not only by undergraduates but also by professors. Since that day, another legend was established at the Moscow Conservatory."

I felt incredibly embarrassed. I never thought I would hear my story through a third party.

Grandfather, my parents, and even Yooha were all looking at me with sparkling eyes.

My friends, who had already experienced me in the chapel, were calm, but their faces showed a hint of surprise, especially at the fact that I had lectured to the proud undergraduates of the Moscow Conservatory.

"Hyun always amazes us. It was quite a struggle to get the tickets this time. To exaggerate, getting tickets for Hyun's solo concert was harder than getting tickets for an Elton John concert. I screamed when I heard the tickets were sold out at dawn."

William from England said as if he was complaining. I felt unreasonably sorry.

"Hyun, why did you hold your solo concert so late?"

It was only natural for them to be curious. Usually, the winner of the Queen Elisabeth Competition would hold a celebratory solo concert that year.

But for the past three years, I had been silent, so they wouldn't understand.

"I didn't feel like I was completely ready yet."

Although it was a short answer, my friends, being musicians, seemed to understand my sensitive nature.

At that moment, Eric, who was gnawing on ribs with both hands, looked at my hand and put down his ribs.

"Hyun, what's that ring? I haven't seen it before."

How could this usually oblivious guy have such sharp eyes at times like these? Anna was also looking at the ring with curiosity.

At that moment, Yooha, who had been waiting for this, shouted out.

"It's a couple ring―!"

* * *

'Amazing.'

The long fingers rested on the piano keys as if they had done their job.

Baek Junghoon's face showed deep excitement.

When Kang Hyun had revised the sheet music a hundred times, he couldn't understand why he pursued perfection so much, but now that he had performed the completed piece together, he was speechless.

"Hyung, let's stop here for today."

"Yes, good idea. We're well warmed up now."

The solo concert was only two days away. They had stayed up all night practicing.

Baek Junghoon's hair was drenched as if he had been caught in a heavy rain, and his shoulders to his waist were soaked with sweat.

Kang Hyun was no different. His arms were filled with surging excitement.

He wanted to keep playing, but his arms were trembling, so he had to stop.

"By the way, how are your friends doing?"

"They said they all went to Gyeongbokgung Palace together today. They probably don't come to the studio to avoid disturbing my solo concert practice."

"If they come to the studio, they'll probably be as surprised as I was when I first came."

Baek Junghoon's eyes turned to the piled-up sheet music. The numerous melodies were all there.

For musicians, this place would seem like a utopia. At that moment.

"Shall I give you one more piece?"

"What?"

Although it was said jokingly, Baek Junghoon was already swallowing his saliva.

But he shook his head. Even with their close relationship, he couldn't accept it lightly. He knew all too well the value of Kang Hyun's sheet music.

"Hyung, shall we play one more piece?"

"Are you sure?"

Although his arms were slightly trembling, Kang Hyun nodded without hesitation.

Seeing this, Baek Junghoon smiled widely. It was just what he had hoped for.

Meanwhile,

At that time, numerous celebrities were arriving at Gimpo International Airport.

General people who were unfamiliar with classical music wouldn't know, but the reporters covering classical music were stunned.

Trusting the information that Im Hyera, the director, had subtly leaked, the waiting reporters repeatedly swallowed their saliva.

"What on earth."

What was going on?

Famous personalities kept arriving at regular intervals all day.

Starting with Queen Hirose of Hyun from neighboring Japan, then Yuri, the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic, and when the members of the London Symphony walked out of the arrival gate in a group, it felt like a dream.

Maestros and virtuosos from around the world were flocking to Korea, a barren land for classical music.

Late at night, when the last flight from Austria arrived, one reporter couldn't help but exclaim.
