The excitement on PD Kim Dahyun's face was unmistakable.

This year marked her tenth year since joining the company. She had hoped to be assigned to a weekend primetime entertainment show, but she ended up in the current affairs and cultural department.

When she first took charge of "Documentary 7," her disappointment was immense. No matter how well she produced the program, it would be meaningless if no one watched it.

"Damn it!"

"Documentary 7" recorded devastatingly low ratings. Just as a new pilot program was about to replace it, a lifeline came down from the heavens for PD Kim Dahyun.

- "Kang Hyun has accepted the offer to appear on the program?"

It was unbelievable news. She had tirelessly sent love calls with a "nothing to lose" attitude.

However, she never dared to think it would become a reality. After all, many people were using their connections to get Kang Hyun on various weekend primetime entertainment shows.

"I heard Kang Hyun frequently watches 'Documentary 7.'"

A miracle happened. The ratings for "Documentary 7," featuring Kang Hyun, soared rapidly.

Was it thanks to that? The episodes assigned after Kang Hyun's three-part series also received great acclaim from viewers.

"Director, if it's okay with you, could we produce a special episode?"

"A special episode?"

"Yes, despite Kang Hyun's three-part series ending, we've been receiving dozens of inquiry calls from viewers every day. I understand he's currently in the U.S., but how about producing one more special episode? Of course, we'll fully accommodate Kang Hyun's appearance fee and convenience!"

The broadcasting station had already entrusted PD Kim Dahyun with full authority. They were willing to pay any amount if they could get Kang Hyun to appear again.

Initially, they had planned to send the head of the department, but considering her past relationship, they sent PD Kim Dahyun. However,

"I'm afraid it's not possible."

Chairwoman Im Hyera firmly shook her head.

"Director, we'll meet any conditions."

"It's not about the appearance fee."

"Pardon?"

Chairwoman Im Hyera paused for a moment before explaining further.

"As you know, many people want to work with Hyun. From the music industry to advertising and broadcasting. You know he's in the U.S. right now?"

"Yes, but..."

"The reason Hyun went to the U.S. is simple. It wasn't for a vacation; it was for business meetings. By now, Hyun is probably surrounded by people."

PD Kim Dahyun was puzzled. Who could she be talking about? Even K Broadcasting Station had promised full support. She thought they could get Kang Hyun again with that level of backing.

"Hollywood."

"Pardon!?"

"Hollywood directors contacted us wanting to meet Hyun. If it were just a few, we would've declined as before, but this time there were too many. So, Hyun decided to go to the U.S. himself. Among those who want to meet Hyun, there are many names you would recognize."

At the mention of Hollywood, PD Kim Dahyun had no choice but to give up.

* * *

"Wait a momentâ€•!"

Kang Hyun waved his hand at the directors clamoring to talk to him. He had expected a social gathering of famous Hollywood directors, but not to this extent.

At Kang Hyun's urgent shout, the directors finally took a step back.

"Can we take turns and discuss one by one?"

The directors nodded briefly at Kang Hyun's mediation. The first to step forward was Director Jim Filmer, who had won the Golden Palm at the Oscars.

Kang Hyun was well aware of his illustrious career and body of work. Even in his past life, he had been a renowned master.

"I have been writing a screenplay for an SF movie. The investment phase is already complete, and only the supporting actor auditions remain. We've confirmed Tom, whom you know, as the lead. However, we haven't found the right insert song for the movie. We've asked numerous music directors, but none of the pieces felt right."

"That means..."

"Yes, I'd like you to compose the insert song for the movie."

Kang Hyun shook his head. He wondered what a distinguished director like Jim Filmer saw in him to make such a proposal.

At that moment, Jim Filmer seemed to read his thoughts and added,

"I was deeply moved by 'La Vie en Rose,' which you participated in. I have a close relationship with Director Jean-Pierre, so I heard a lot about you. After listening to your albums, I realized you could compose the music I want."

From Jim Filmer onward, the highly esteemed Hollywood directors, one by one, requested Kang Hyun to work on their projects.

Most of them wanted him to compose insert songs for their films.

"What on earth..."

Kang Hyun couldn't hide his bewilderment. Why did all these famous Hollywood directors seem to think he was some extraordinary genius?

Finally, James Cameron approached Kang Hyun.

"It's finally my turn."

James Cameron took out a thick script from his coat and handed it to Kang Hyun. The cover had no title, and it was filled with Post-its from numerous revisions.

"I wrote this script with you in mind as the protagonist."

"Director, I'm sorry, but I've never acted in a movie before. I've never learned voice acting or acting."

"I wrote this script after studying the persona of 'Hyun.' You embody an aura of mystery. You possess a natural talent that makes you a perfect fit for a movie actor. Though I want to ask you to star in the film right here, I know other directors won't stand still. If you accept my offer, you won't have time for other projects."

Filming a movie wasn't easy. Kang Hyun had already experienced this during the "La Vie en Rose" and "Paganini" projects. Although he had only done simultaneous recording, he knew how long movie actors had to be on standby on set.

"I can't give you a definite answer right now. I need some time to think about it."

It was a decision that required careful consideration. While it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for most people, Kang Hyun was different. The directors also seemed to understand, nodding in agreement.

At that moment, a bald director handed Kang Hyun a wine glass.

"Let's enjoy the night. Why are you hesitating? Take it. My old arm is about to break."

"Ah, thank you."

"Everyone here is enchanted by the violinist Hyun. While it might be our first meeting, most of us have been to your concerts as audience members. How can we not be happy?"

As the bald director raised his wine glass, the other directors followed suit.

With a kindly smile, the bald director proposed a toast.

"Let's get drunk with our muse tonight!"

* * *

"Hmm."

What should I do?

Kang Hyun was overwhelmed by the numerous scripts decorating his view, along with a hangover.

Didn't he receive scripts from each of the directors? If they leaked, it would be a huge issue, but the directors trusted Kang Hyun enough to hand them over.

"Bill Gray?"

Kang Hyun exclaimed. Some of the scripts contained works he was already familiar with.

Most were working titles, but some had the original titles indicated. He couldn't help but recognize them, having deeply admired these masterpieces in his past life. Just then,

Knock, knock.

There was a knock on the hotel room door.

"I didn't order room service..."

Curiously, he got up and opened the door to find a familiar figure. It was Son Yooha, with her long hair down to her waist and cat-like features.

She looked up at Kang Hyun with a pouty face.

"Oppa!"

Only then did Kang Hyun realize he had made a mistake. Today was the day they had planned a date.

They were supposed to watch a movie together at a theater in New York's bustling district. Ironically, he had been so preoccupied with the directors that he had completely forgotten.

"Yooha, I'm sorry."

Son Yooha's cheeks puffed up, resembling a furious pufferfish. Fortunately, her anger didn't last long.

"I couldn't wait for you, so I canceled our movie tickets and came straight to the hotel. What were you doing at that meeting that made you forget our date? And what's with the smell of alcohol?"

Son Yooha squinted her eyes and interrogated Kang Hyun.

Seeing her reminded Kang Hyun of Son Yooha, the CEO of Jeil Trading, from his past life. She was known as the Ice Queen, commanding many executives.

Kang Hyun gulped and explained what had happened at the meeting.

"What? James Cameron? Jim Filmer?"

Son Yooha couldn't hide her astonishment. Even those with no interest in movies would recognize the names of these famous directors.

Then she asked seriously,

"Oppa, are you going to act in the movie?"

"Huh?"

"I mean James Cameron's movie."

It would be a lie to say he wasn't tempted. After all, Kang Hyun loved movies as much as classical music.

"Phew. If you act in it, people will talk a lot again..."

"What do you mean?"

"After you won the Gramophone Record Award, do you know how much my school friends talk about you? Some even have bookmarks with your photo printed on them."

To think that a photo bookmark, something allowed only for nostalgic teen stars, would apply to him as well.

Kang Hyun found it both amusing and endearing to see Yooha so serious. He knew what she was worried about.

"Don't worry."

After reassuring Yooha, Kang Hyun looked at the scripts piled on the table. Just reading them evoked musical inspiration.

"Just do what you want to do, Oppa."

At that moment, Yooha looked at Kang Hyun with a determined gaze. Only then did Kang Hyun realize what he truly wanted.

Composing music had become his life's purpose at some point. It was a feeling he had never experienced in his past life as a lawyer.

Then, Son Yooha looked around the spacious hotel room and said,

"Can I stay here tonight?"
