Producer Kim Dahyun's face was unmistakably filled with excitement.

This year marked her tenth year since joining the company. She wanted to schedule a weekend prime-time entertainment show, but she ended up in the current affairs and culture department.

When she first took charge of "Documentary 7," her disappointment was beyond words. No matter how well you produce a program, it's pointless if no one watches it.

"Damn it!"

The viewership ratings for "Documentary 7" were abysmal. Just as a new pilot program was about to replace "Documentary 7," a lifeline came down from the heavens for Producer Kim Dahyun.

- "Kang Hyun has accepted the offer to appear on the program?"

It was an unbelievable story. She had tirelessly sent love calls, thinking it was better to try and fail than not to try at all.

But she never dared to think it would come true. After all, many people were using every connection they had to recruit Kang Hyun for various weekend prime-time entertainment programs on different networks.

"Kang Hyun regularly watches 'Documentary 7.'"

A miracle happened. The viewership ratings for "Documentary 7" skyrocketed after Kang Hyun appeared on the show.

Was it because of that? The episodes that followed Kang Hyun’s three-part series also received great acclaim from the viewers.

"Director, if it's okay with you, could we produce a special episode?"

"A special episode?"

"Yes, despite Kang Hyun's three-part series ending, we receive dozens of inquiry calls from viewers every day. I understand he's currently in the U.S., but how about producing and airing one more special episode? Of course, we'll accommodate all of Kang Hyun's appearance fees and conveniences!"

Even the broadcasting station had entrusted all authority to Producer Kim Dahyun. They were willing to pay any amount if they could recruit Kang Hyun again.

They initially intended to send the head of the department, but considering her long-standing relationship, they sent Producer Kim Dahyun instead. However,

"Unfortunately, it won't be possible."

Vice President Im Hyera shook her head firmly.

"Director, we will meet any conditions you require."

"It's not about the appearance fee."

"Excuse me?"

Vice President Im Hyera paused briefly before continuing.

"As you know, many people want to work with Hyun. From the music industry to the advertising industry and even the broadcasting industry. You know he's currently in the U.S.?"

"Yes, but..."

"The reason he went to the U.S. is simple. It wasn't for a vacation but for business meetings. By now, Hyun is probably surrounded by people."

Producer Kim Dahyun was puzzled. Who could possibly be surrounding him? Even K Broadcasting had promised full support. She thought this would be enough to recruit Kang Hyun again.

"Hollywood."

"What!?"

"Directors from Hollywood contacted us wanting to meet Hyun. If it were just one or two, we would have refused as before, but this time there were too many. So Hyun decided to go to the U.S. himself. Among those wanting to meet Hyun, there are many whose names you would know well."

At the mention of Hollywood, Producer Kim Dahyun had no choice but to give up.

* * *

"Hold on a second—!"

Kang Hyun waved his hand at the directors rushing towards him. He had expected a social gathering of famous Hollywood directors, but not to this extent.

At Kang Hyun's urgent shout, the directors finally took a step back.

"Can we take turns talking one by one?"

The directors nodded briefly at Kang Hyun's mediation. The first to step forward was Director Jim Filmer, who had won the Palme d'Or at the Oscars.

Kang Hyun was already familiar with his illustrious career and body of work. He had made a name for himself as a master even in his previous life.

"I have a script for an SF movie I'm writing. The investment stage is already complete. We only have the supporting cast auditions left. We've confirmed Tom, whom you know, as the lead. But we haven't found a suitable soundtrack for the movie yet. We've asked numerous music directors, but none have created a track that fits."

"So, what you're saying is..."

"Yes, I'd like to ask you to compose a soundtrack for the movie."

Kang Hyun shook his head. He wondered what Director Jim Filmer saw in him to make such a proposal.

At that moment, Jim Filmer added, as if reading Kang Hyun's thoughts,

"I was deeply impressed by 'La Vie en Rose' that you participated in. I also have a close relationship with Director Jean-Pierre and got detailed information about you from him. After listening to your album, I realized that you could certainly compose the music I am looking for."

Starting with Jim Filmer, famous Hollywood directors, known for their high standards, began to request Kang Hyun’s participation.

Most of them wanted him to compose soundtracks for their films.

"Why on earth..."

Kang Hyun couldn’t hide his bewilderment. It seemed that all these famous Hollywood directors thought of him as an extraordinary genius.

Finally, James Cameron approached Kang Hyun.

"Finally, it's my turn."

James Cameron took out a thick script from his pocket and handed it to Kang Hyun. The cover had no title, and post-it notes were stuck between the pages, indicating multiple revisions.

"This script was written with you in mind as the protagonist."

"Director, I'm sorry, but I've never acted in a movie before. I've never learned vocalization or acting."

"I wrote this script after thoroughly researching the character of Hyun. Just being yourself, you exude a sense of mystery. You have a talent that makes you more than suitable for a film actor. I'd love to ask you to star in my film right here, but if I did that, other directors wouldn't stay quiet. If you accept my offer, you won't have time for their projects."

Filming a movie was not an easy task. Kang Hyun had previously experienced it with "La Vie en Rose" and "Paganini." Although he only did simultaneous recording, he knew how long actors had to stay on set.

"I can't give you any definitive answers right now. I need some time to think about it."

It was a matter that required deep contemplation. For most people, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but Kang Hyun was different. The directors nodded in agreement, as if they expected this response.

At that moment, a bald director handed Kang Hyun a glass of wine.

"Well, let's enjoy today together. Why are you hesitating? Take it before my old arm breaks."

"Oh, thank you."

"We are all enchanted by the violinist Hyun. Although it might be our first time meeting, many of us have attended your concerts as audience members. How could we not be delighted?"

When the bald director raised his glass, the other directors followed suit.

With a kind smile, the bald director offered a toast.

"Let's get drunk with our muse today!"

* * *

"Hmm."

What should I do?

Kang Hyun was overwhelmed by the countless scripts in front of him, coupled with a hangover.

He had received scripts from each of the directors. If any of them were leaked, it would be a big deal, but the directors trusted Kang Hyun that much.

"Bill Grey?"

Kang Hyun gasped. Among the scripts were titles he was already familiar with.

Most had working titles, but some still bore their original titles. They were masterpieces that had deeply moved him in his previous life, so he couldn't help but recognize them. Just then,

Knock knock.

There was a knock on the hotel room door.

"I didn't order room service…?"

Curious, he got up and opened the door to reveal a familiar figure. With long hair down to her waist and a cat-like face, it was Son Yooha.

She looked up at Kang Hyun with an extremely pouty expression.

"Oppa!"

Only then did Kang Hyun realize his mistake. Today was the day he promised to go on a date. 

They were supposed to watch a movie together at a theater in downtown New York. Ironically, he had forgotten about it while dealing with the onslaught of movie directors.

"Yooha, I'm sorry."

Son Yooha's cheeks puffed up, resembling an angry pufferfish. Fortunately, her anger didn't last long.

"When Oppa didn't show up, I canceled the ticket and came straight to the hotel. What exactly did you do at the gathering that made you forget our date? And what's with the smell of alcohol?"

Son Yooha narrowed her eyes and questioned Kang Hyun as if interrogating him.

Seeing her, Kang Hyun was reminded of Son Yooha, the president of Jeil Trading, from his past life. She was a formidable woman who moved countless executives and was nicknamed the "Ice Queen."

Kang Hyun gulped and began to explain what had happened at the gathering.

"What? James Cameron? Jim Filmer?"

Son Yooha couldn't hide her surprise. Even people who weren't interested in movies would have heard of these famous directors.

Then, with a serious expression, she asked,

"Oppa, are you going to act in a movie?"

"Huh?"

"I mean James Cameron’s project."

It would be a lie to say it wasn't tempting. Kang Hyun loved movies as much as he loved classical music.

"Sigh. If Oppa acts in a movie, people will start talking a lot again…"

"What do you mean, talk a lot?"

"Ever since Oppa won the Gramophone Award, do you know how much my school friends talk about you? One even printed your photo to keep in her bookmark."

Who would have thought that his photo would be used in bookmarks, something that was once reserved for nostalgic teen stars?

Kang Hyun found Son Yooha's serious expression incredibly cute. He understood what she was worried about.

"Don't worry."

After reassuring Yooha, Kang Hyun looked at the pile of scripts on the table. The scripts were so captivating that they inspired musical ideas just by reading them.

"Just do what you want to do, Oppa."

At that moment, Yooha looked at Kang Hyun, almost as if she were giving him advice. Only then did Kang Hyun begin to understand what he truly wanted.

Composing music had started to feel like his life's work. It was an emotion he never felt when he was living his past life as a lawyer.

At that moment, Son Yooha glanced around the spacious hotel room and said,
