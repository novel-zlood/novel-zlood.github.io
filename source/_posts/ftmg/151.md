"Already one person has withdrawn."

Spencer's cheek twitched. It was an unexpected result. He never imagined that someone would declare their withdrawal right after the first audition.

Did they withdraw because they lacked skill? Nonsense. The new conductors selected by Spencer were all next-generation maestros representing their respective countries.

"Maestro, the members were also shocked, but the conductors must have been even more shocked."

Dmitri added, as if he couldn't help it. Spencer nodded briefly. It was not wrong. He himself couldn't hide his surprise after watching Kang Hyun's conducting.

The way he directed the members in perfect order and rearranged the ensemble was like watching a movie. Even renowned maestros couldn't act so decisively at once. It was so impressive it sent chills down his spine.

"Still, I didn't expect Mr. Su to withdraw. Isn't he known to have quite a strong pride as a conductor?"

"Is it just strong pride? I've heard that even the principal members of major Philharmonics don't want to engage in a battle of nerves with Su. His pride is as lofty as his tenacity is strong. Even as a guest, his pride as a conductor is too strong to be put into words. Maybe that's why he gave up."

Dmitri understood the hidden meaning in the maestro's words. Even though it was just the first audition, Kang Hyun's capabilities as a conductor were clearly evident.

Even the members who have played in the London Symphony, considered the world's best orchestra for many years, couldn't hide their surprise. How much more so would a fellow conductor be shocked?

"Hyun has grown much more than before."

"That's right. Honestly, I couldn't believe how proficiently he reshuffled the ensemble. I never imagined he would change so quickly."

When he learned conducting at the London Symphony before, he wasn't at this level. He was definitely outstanding then, but he hadn't yet acquired such experience.

However, the Kang Hyun he showed in the first audition looked like a maestro with years of conducting experience.

Kang Hyun, who had blossomed as a violinist, was now also blooming as a conductor. It made one curious about how far his talent would fully bloom.

"Dmitri, how would you feel if you missed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?"

"Wouldn't I feel complicated and sad? For example, it would be similar to the feelings of the conductors who will be eliminated from this audition. The royal performance is of great significance to conductors. If they miss this opportunity, they may never get it again."

"Right, I thought so too. But Su was different."

Spencer showed a peculiar smile. Su from China withdrew from the audition, leaving one message with the maestro, and his voice still echoed in maestro Spencer's ears.

"I found the path I need to take."

* * *

"Are you kidding?"

I didn't understand. Wasn't he in a competitive relationship with me before the competition? Especially musicians, who are proud and sensitive. Moreover, my conducting experience was short compared to Su.

But the man in front of me didn't seem to be joking. Rather, his voice was extremely serious.

"Let me down first, will you?"

Chrissy awkwardly released the grip on his collar.

Only then did Su, who had been floating in the air, comfortably set his feet on the ground, and his eyes were far from frightened. Instead, he was tidying his clothes, paying attention to his appearance.

As if he didn't like the wrinkled tie, he immediately loosened it, and the way he did it was quite natural.

"I withdrew from the audition."

"Withdrew?"

"I'm no longer interested in the royal performance."

As he finished speaking, he looked at me with dangerously intense eyes. It was a gaze I had experienced before, similar to the look of Chairman Wang and Baek Jeong-hoon.

"Teaching knows no age."

The nine tones of clear Cantonese. Upon understanding without an interpreter, Su nodded.

He then smiled contentedly, adding, "The rumor that you're proficient in languages isn't false." I wondered where he heard such a rumor.

"What do you want in return?"

It sounded like a famous line from a drama I had watched in my previous life. Just like the actor who said, "How much do you want?" Su's gaze was also extremely intense, making him look like a second-generation conglomerate.

I slowly shook my head. I wasn't lacking in money either.

It was then.

"I heard your father runs a company. If you want to expand your business to China, I can help. I didn't investigate you on purpose. I just saw the family details in your profile in the record."

"Business expansion?"

"If you teach me, I'll give you a suitable reward."

I recalled my previous life. Although I was interested in classical music, I had never heard the name "Su."

The issue wasn't about fame. It was simply that I didn't know everyone in the classical music world. But still...

"Is he really a second-generation conglomerate?"

He might be from a high-ranking official family in the Chinese Communist Party. If he offers to help with business expansion into China, there's no reason to refuse, but as always, there's no favor without a reason.

"I'm sorry, but it's problematic to receive such a big reward just for teaching conducting."

"Is it not enough?"

"No, the problem is that it's too extensive. Business expansion involves numerous issues. Besides, you might not even know what kind of business my father runs."

"If you're rejecting for that reason, you don't need to worry. My family runs many businesses too. I can open any path you want in China."

It seemed he misunderstood my words.

Seizing the opportunity, Su invited me to his mansion. After much contemplation, I nodded. Chrissy ended up driving us to the mansion.

How long did we drive?

Huh?

A familiar scene unfolded.

Following Su's guidance, we arrived in the suburbs, away from the city. The large iron gate, which I had seen before, opened automatically.

Wasn't this the mansion owned by Geumwang Group? With a puzzled look, Su gazed at the mansion and said.

"This is my family's mansion."

It felt like cold water was poured over my head. If Su was the only son of Geumwang Group, it made sense.

Su, standing upright, came into my view. Now, I understood why I didn't remember the name "Su." In my previous life, he was an unfortunate conglomerate who passed away young.

After the shock, the huge iron gate closed firmly behind us.

* * *

"I'll give you a week."

Spencer looked at the three conductors. Su's withdrawal from the first audition was unexpected, but Miles from the U.S. and Matthew from Europe quickly accepted it. Kang Hyun's performance was that impactful.

"Each of you will conduct the same symphony one by one. The order will be decided by drawing lots on the day."

It was a simple and concise problem. However, the burden of having to conduct the same symphony lay beneath. This would reveal each conductor's abilities clearly.

Moreover, the members of the London Symphony would undoubtedly feel the differences among the three.

Miles and Matthew's faces showed signs of tension. They never expected to be judged with the same piece.

But they had no intention of losing. As they held their scores, Kang Hyun's face reflected in their eyes.

"Hyun, you stay a bit longer."

Spencer called Hyun. He had heard from Dmitri that Hyun had completed a symphony. When Spencer asked if he could see it, Hyun had said there was no problem.

With Matthew and Miles gone, only Hyun and Spencer remained.

"The format is unique?"

"I didn't follow the traditional format. I think you'll be more surprised when you actually hear it."

Kang Hyun looked confident. Spencer felt he could understand the reason just by holding the score. The array of musical ideas spread across the staves was mesmerizing.

From the orchestration to the additional parts used in the second and fourth movements, and even the mixed four-part choir.

Could it really be that such a young boy wrote this score?

Like Baek Jeong-hoon, Spencer's eyes trembled.

"When's the premiere?"

"I haven't thought of a specific place yet. After the royal performance, if it's okay, I was thinking of asking the members of the London Symphony."

Spencer cheered inwardly. If the other members heard Kang Hyun's words now, they would feel the same. The score was that captivating and enchanting.

Spencer wanted to gather the members immediately to premiere this symphony.

However, it wasn't easy to proceed with such a large-scale orchestral composition without sufficient personnel.

"What's the title of the symphony? No, let's go to the conducting room and have a detailed discussion. Do you have time?"

"Maestro, I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement today."

"A prior engagement?"

Spencer's eyes were full of regret.

A symphony, as a concept of narrative, holds countless thoughts and ideologies. But all the creators of such masterpieces had passed away. Thus, it was exciting to be able to hear the interpretation directly from a living composer.

However, Kang Hyun, leaving the regretful Spencer behind, added a curious statement.

"I have a tutoring session scheduled."

* * *

Su was amazed by the boy named Kang Hyun. Regardless of nationality or age, he thought Kang Hyun was worthy of respect.

When exchanging musical knowledge, it felt like talking to an older professor rather than a peer. His musical talent was so deep that it was astonishing.

"Young master, Mr. Hyun has arrived."

Su couldn't hide his surprise when he realized that the mysterious boy the butler had met before was Kang Hyun.

Just then, Kang Hyun entered the mansion. His piercing eyes and confident strides made it seem as if he was glowing from behind.

At that moment, Su understood his father's words. When managing a company, there would come a time when you find someone you want to make your own.

"Mr. Su, have you completed the assignment I gave you?"

Su suppressed a dry laugh. Wasn't it a bit odd for an adult to be tutored by a high school student?

However, when Kang Hyun took on the role of a teacher, Su couldn't even breathe properly. His ability to point out mistakes one by one was almost supernatural.

"It seems you misinterpreted this part. You said the beginning of the second movement signifies an intense and resistant melody? That's not what I meant in the score I gave you. Think again and submit it before our next session."

Interpreting a score precisely is impossible unless it's the composer. The reason Kang Hyun spoke with such certainty was because he himself was the composer.

At first, it was hard to believe. How could such a young boy create such a score?

After that, Su felt the immense wall of talent.

"Again."

Kang Hyun played the piano instead of an orchestra.

Su looked at the piano and conducted as if he were on the podium.

Wasn't this a common method used in international competitions? However, Su thought that Kang Hyun's gaze was more intense than that of the judges at international competitions.

"Again!"

Whenever there was a lacking part, they went back to the beginning. Kang Hyun's piano performance was top-notch. It was believable enough to think of him as a pianist rather than a violinist.

His long fingers danced gracefully over the keys. Meanwhile, Su's arm trembled like an aspen tree. It was the natural result of conducting non-stop for hours.

"Let's take a short break."

"Hyun, let's continue."

"Mr. Su, continuing to conduct doesn't improve your skills. You know, muscles grow better with intervals. Besides, I won't be able to come for a while. The final audition task has been assigned. So."

The elderly butler watched the two men with a pleased smile. It was the first time he had seen the young master smile so happily.

To others, it might look expressionless, but the elderly butler, who had served the young master for a long time, knew even the slightest change in his expression.

At that moment, when Kang Hyun, seated on the piano bench, spoke, the young master's cheek twitched with delight.
