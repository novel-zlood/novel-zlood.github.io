"Oppa, are you really just going to sit there?"

Isn't that a voice resembling a fierce cat?

"No, Hyunja, you too. If your husband is such a jerk, you should at least pretend to stop him. His eyes were no joke. If left alone, he might really hit our little oppa."

"Bokja is right. Hyung, how dare a mere small-town laundry owner come in and disrupt our family—!"

"Oh, it's so hot. Ma'am, please bring some ice water quickly!"

The younger uncle, who had been grabbed by the collar by Kang Hyun's father, was panting with a red face. The housemaid hurriedly brought a glass filled with ice water.

The house was filled with extravagant decorations, starkly contrasting the old-fashioned mansion in Ichon-dong with its lavishness.

This was none other than the house of the eldest, Yoo Beomjin.

"Father isn't going to get up from his bed anytime soon, right?"

"The doctor says he might have to stay bedridden for quite a while."

"Well, I hope Father gets up soon, but I'm worried he might side with Hyunja's family as soon as he recovers. Just imagine if he lets Kang take over Dongju."

Eldest Yoo Beomjin's eyebrows shot up. It was no different for second Yoo Beomkyung. They had never thought that the management rights of Dongju would go to anyone other than themselves.

The three siblings had little interest in their father's illness. Instead, they thought now was the perfect time.

"I've already said that all we need to do is expand our hospital, but you, oppas, aren't the same. Especially you, big oppa, weren't you planning to lead Dongju in the future? If things continue like this, it'll be completely taken over by that fox."

"That's harsh. But do you really think Father would easily give Dongju to Kang? It's something he's built his whole life; of course, he'd entrust it to his own blood. Everyone in the company knows how well Hyung has led Dongju so far."

"Ma'am, I'd like whiskey instead of ice water."

First Yoo Beomjin soothed his burning throat with whiskey. Although the three siblings shared the same goal of not losing Dongju, their visions for the future were different. It could be said they had different dreams in the same bed.

"Hyung, Father wouldn't really give Dongju to Kang, would he?"

"Do you think he would give Dongju to a dimwit like him? Business isn't something you can do on the spur of the moment. If you entrust it to someone without guts, it's easy to lose everything overnight."

"Then what about Kang Hyun? I can't imagine Father would go that far, but…”

What?

The face of his nephew Kang Hyun flashed in Yoo Beomjin's mind. He was undoubtedly the most cherished among the grandchildren. Actually, if you think about it, Father seemed to like Kang Hyun more than the three siblings.

But Yoo Beomjin soon shook his head nervously.

"What can that little brat possibly do—!"

* * *

In my past life, it was challenging to even visit the grand mansion in Pyeongchang-dong. At the end of the long garden path, surrounded by red walls reminiscent of a fortress, stood the mansion that would later be known as the holy ground of the Jeil Group.

Chairman Wang, who was trimming the garden trees with pruning shears, greeted me as if he had been expecting my arrival.

"Did your uncles visit Ichon-dong this morning?"

"Yes, Grandfather."

"I was worried about Chairman Yoo and thought of stopping by early, but I didn't want to interfere in family matters. So, what brings you here, Hyun?"

This sly old man. He knew everything that happened in Ichon-dong as if he had it in the palm of his hand. He probably also knew why I came to Pyeongchang-dong. His eyes had a peculiar glint of mischief.

"I came to ask for your help, Chairman."

"Help? Hmm, let's discuss it in the parlor. I just received some good tea leaves yesterday."

Chairman Wang seemed more pleased with the word "Chairman" than "help" coming from my mouth.

The parlor was filled with a lingering scent.

"Tell me, Hyun, what is it you want to ask?"

"I want to protect Dongju."

"Protect Dongju? Is someone trying to take it away?"

Of course, if Dongju fell into the hands of my eldest and second uncles, it would be as good as lost.

It was clear as day that it would be divided and absorbed by foreign capital, just like in my past life.

Can't I do it myself, you ask? No, I'm still legally a minor.

"I need a pawn."

"A pawn?"

"Someone to act on my behalf."

Just like Liu Bei had the great generals Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, I needed a capable general to act as my hands and feet until I became an adult.

Chairman Wang leaned forward with interest at the mention of "pawn."

"You haven't forgotten our promise, have you?"

"You're referring to the promise that if I recover all of Dongju's shares within two years, you'd give me a gift?"

"Yes, but if you achieve it with my help, that would be cheating."

Such a stingy old man.

"I will pay for borrowing the pawn. So, it's not cheating."

"Do you have someone in mind for the pawn?"

"Yes, I do."

Chairman Wang looked surprised when I answered without hesitation.

From the moment I decided to protect Dongju, I knew I needed a pawn to act for me since I was a minor.

Of course, if Grandfather were in good health, I wouldn't need a pawn, but that's not the case now.

I sipped my tea and spoke directly.

"I want to use Director Kim Sang-guk from the Strategy Planning Office."

"Director Kim?"

"Yes, Chairman."

Chairman Wang's face showed clear signs of contemplation. It was understandable since Kim Sang-guk was the head of the Strategy Planning Office.

The Strategy Planning Office, the brain of the Jeil Group.

In other words, I had chosen a big shot right from the start. Chairman Wang probably never imagined I would want to use Kim Sang-guk as my pawn.

"Do you know what kind of person Director Kim is?"

"Yes, I do."

"Do you really know? Even if I approve, Director Kim might refuse. He wouldn't want to waste his time on something unproductive."

Chairman Wang knew I had interned at the Strategy Planning Office. In fact, he had actively supported it. But he probably thought it was impossible to thoroughly understand Kim Sang-guk in such a short time.

"Do you still want to use Director Kim as your pawn?"

But Chairman Wang overlooked something. In my past life, I had meticulously studied Kim Sang-guk.

Preparing to become a member of the National Assembly involved understanding the personalities of the Blue House officials.

Naturally, I had to have a thorough understanding of Prime Minister Kim Sang-guk. Why did I want to use Kim Sang-guk?

"Yes, Chairman."

Because his nickname was "Bulldozer." No wonder he was more popular than the president.

* * *

"Pawn?"

Kim Sang-guk's face was full of bewilderment. Even as he tied his necktie, he still couldn't understand.

Early in the morning, Chairman Wang had personally contacted him, saying someone wanted to hire him.

At first, he thought he was being discarded. How many years had he lived as a Jeil Group scholar? He had finally become the head of the Strategy Planning Office through hard work, only to be told he was being transferred elsewhere.

-Director Kim, it's not a demotion, so don't worry. You know I like you more than anyone else, right? If you don't like the offer, you can refuse. It will be an interesting position.

He couldn't read Chairman Wang's intentions. If it wasn't a demotion, why was he being sent elsewhere? Knowing Chairman Wang, he wouldn't give up his assets easily.

Kim Sang-guk shook off his thoughts and finished tying his necktie. Whatever it was, he would find out once he went to the meeting place.

"I have a reservation under the name Kim Sang-guk."

The manager of the high-end establishment skillfully guided Kim Sang-guk. He had visited this place a few times with Chairman Wang. Who could be waiting for him?

"Kang Hyun?"

The person he met at the high-end establishment in Cheongdam-dong seemed out of place.

At first, he thought he had entered the wrong room. But Kang Hyun stood up and greeted him as if he had been waiting.

"Welcome, Director Kim. The red sea bream here is excellent."

"What?"

"The food just came out, so let's talk while we eat."

Kim Sang-guk sat down, feeling almost mesmerized, facing Kang Hyun. Kang Hyun seemed very comfortable, as if he had been here many times before.

After some time, Kim Sang-guk, who had been eating red sea bream dipped in soy sauce, finally put down his chopsticks. The reason was simple. No one else had shown up.

"Are you the one who wants to hire me, Hyun?"

"Yes, Director."

"Huh."

He was beyond astonished. But as soon as he met Kang Hyun's eyes, he erased his sigh.

Because his eyes were so serious. He knew firsthand that Hyun was a very capable child. He had seen Hyun's skills with his own eyes.

"Alright, let's hear it. Why do you want to hire me?"

"Because I'm a minor."

"Is that the only reason?"

Hyun didn't elaborate further. He wore a mysterious smile as if he wouldn't reveal more until the contract was signed.

Kim Sang-guk felt his heart race, just as it did when he had a one-on-one with Chairman Wang.

"The contract period is two years. The detailed job description will be provided upon signing the contract. Please review this contract first."

"Contract?"

Kim Sang-guk took the document Hyun handed him. It was a professionally prepared contract, as if it had been meticulously reviewed by a legal team.

But Hyun showed no reaction and continued eating the red sea bream. He was as relaxed as a seasoned veteran who had been through this countless times. It felt as if their roles were reversed in terms of experience and age.

"Hyun, do you think I'll leave my current position to join you?"

"You won't be able to resist."

"What?"

Hyun put down his chopsticks with a clink and spoke.

"Director Kim, you have ambition."

"Ambition?"

"Yes, if I'm not mistaken, you could easily discard the title of Jeil Group scholar when the time comes. Most people don't even know you are a scholar. You wouldn't be satisfied with just being a subsidiary president, would you?"

Kim Sang-guk couldn't hide his surprise. How did Hyun know such things?

On the other hand, he was intrigued. What gave Hyun the confidence to make such bold claims?

He knew Chairman Wang had shown a special interest in Hyun. He was undoubtedly destined to become a great figure in the future.

"Are you saying you can fulfill my ambitions better than Chairman Son?"

Hyun simply smiled. Kim Sang-guk suppressed a hollow laugh.

Was the smile on this young boy's face born from immense confidence? Or was it just childish thinking?

However, no matter how much he thought about it, the young boy's eyes were anything but childish.

"Then let me ask you one thing. What's the first thing you will do?"

They say you can tell a lot from one thing. He was curious about Hyun's plans for using him as a pawn.

"The war has already begun."

"War?"

"Yes, a war without the smell of gunpowder. To survive."

At that moment, Hyun's eyes gleamed sharply.

"First, we need to gather money."
