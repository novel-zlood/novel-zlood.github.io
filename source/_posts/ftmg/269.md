Time flows like a river.

[The second half has just started in the match between Korea and Portugal, with the score tied at 0:0. Ahn Jung-hwan, known as the "Terius of the Ground," continues his dazzling dribbles. Lee Young-pyo receives the pass and quickly advances with the ball. Park Ji-sung receives Lee Young-pyo's centering, Park Ji-sung! Traps it with his chest and shoots with his left foot―!]

The cheers from households across South Korea were loud enough to shake the nation.

The mansion in Ichon-dong was no different. The grandfather, who was watching the World Cup while eating chicken, jumped up from his seat in surprise.

The parents, who were taking care of the two-month-old Haengbok, also embraced each other in joy.

It was the decisive goal by the national team battling Portugal.

Park Ji-sung's powerful left-footed shot at the tender age of 21 secured South Korea's place in the round of 16.

"Kang, wasn't I right? I told you South Korea would make it to the round of 16!"

The excitement was evident on the grandfather’s face. Kang Hyun felt the same. Although he had already seen this scene in his previous life, watching it with his family in the Ichon-dong mansion felt refreshingly different.

Especially Park Ji-sung's chest trap followed by the left-footed shot—it was a scene straight out of a movie, even on a second viewing.

"Father-in-law, I lost the bet, but I couldn't be happier. Look at Haengbok, too. He's so happy that he keeps smiling. Woo-woo choo-choo."

Hyun's father was smiling, holding his younger brother Haengbok in his arms.

Haengbok was the same. The baby, who didn't know any better, was beaming with joy. His giggles sounded more beautiful than any melody.

At that moment, the grandfather glanced at Hyun and asked,

"Hyun, do you still think they’ll make it to the semifinals? I thought making it to the round of 16 was already a blessing, but now I find myself hoping for the quarterfinals."

Realistically, even experts had deemed South Korea's advancement to the round of 16 difficult. The draw wasn't favorable, but the team had united and made it happen.

Hyun gave a faint smile and nodded briefly.

"It's definitely the semifinals."

The grandfather looked puzzled by Hyun's confident assertion but soon nodded vigorously.

"Yes, a man should dream big. Let's aim for winning the World Cup," he shouted, cheering for the national team.

[The South Korean national soccer team is making history. Not only have they reached the round of 16 and the quarterfinals, but they have also taken Spain, a European powerhouse, to a penalty shootout. Hwang Sun-hong is the first kicker. We believe in him. The South Korean people believe in and support the national team. The referee blows the whistle―!]

The commentator's voice was trembling. Yooha, who was tightly gripping Hyun's hand, was also breathing shakily. Any South Korean would be trembling at this moment.

When the national team players' shots made the net ripple, cheers burst out from tightly pressed lips. But the outcome was still uncertain.

[The final kicker for the South Korean national team is captain Hong Myung-bo. If he scores, South Korea advances to the semifinals. Hong Myung-bo shoots!]

At that tense moment,

[It's a goal, a goal―! The South Korean national team advances to the World Cup semifinals! The national team has made history in South Korean soccer. Truly, hurrah for South Korea. It's a moment of joy―!]

South Korea started to tremble. The streets of Seoul filled with citizens in red clothes, cheering.

The waves of cheers echoed across the nation.

They were all gathered in the Ichon-dong mansion, watching the World Cup together. Yooha, elated, hugged Hyun tightly and even showered him with secret kisses.

Mwah, mwah, mwah.

Their parents also hugged each other, overjoyed. Even Haengbok, lying in the cradle, watched the scene and burst into laughter.

Usually a man of few words, Chairman Son Il-seon also showed signs of excitement. Seeing this, Representative Im Hyera linked arms with her husband and leaned on him playfully. Chairman Wang looked on with satisfaction.

Meanwhile, the grandfather, with a curious gaze, said to Hyun,

"They really made it to the semifinals."

The dreamlike miracle of making it to the semifinals had come true. Only then did the grandfather remember. Even before the World Cup started, Hyun had confidently predicted this outcome.

The reason the eternal maestro Gustav had come to Korea was none other than Hyun.

Gustav, in a wheelchair, visited Hyun's studio with the help of his assistant. Hyun welcomed him with tea adorned with flower petals.

"Maestro, I was surprised by your sudden visit. I apologize for not keeping in touch more often."

"Don't say such things. The letters you occasionally send give this old man vitality. I came to Korea because I wanted to see your face after a long time. I should be the one apologizing for the sudden visit. This old man is just curious about what progress your music has made."

"Is there a musician in the world who would refuse a visit from the maestro? I'm honored you remember me and came to see me. Maestro, please wait a moment."

Hyun got up and handed over the scores he had composed to Gustav. Sitting in his wheelchair, Gustav looked at the scores Hyun had meticulously drawn and smiled with satisfaction.

He knew that Hyun was already very popular in the United States and Europe. Despite his immense popularity, Hyun had not neglected his music. The scores before him were more beautiful than ever.

The notes on the scores, like flowers blooming on fertile soil, made Gustav's heart race.

"Hyun, your boundless talent shows no signs of stopping. You make this old man's heart race. I've met many musicians, but none have put me at ease and excited me as much as you, except perhaps Yascha."

Gustav clasped Hyun's hand with his aged one. There were not many musicians with whom he felt this comfortable conversing.

Hyun thought that the eternal maestro's gaze resembled that of his grandfather.

"Choi, bring the item."

At Gustav's command, his assistant brought over an old violin case.

Hyun knew what it was. Gustav had shown it to him before.

"This is the last will left to me by Yascha and his essence captured in this violin. I wanted to give it to you before, but you said it wasn't time yet."

It was the legendary violin used by Yascha Heifetz, who had opened the 20th century.

The violin, glowing with a red hue like the sunset on the horizon, was so well-maintained that anyone could tell it was in pristine condition.

The silver strings, gleaming as if they might start playing a melody at any moment, made anyone's heart race.

"La felicità, that's its name."

La felicità.

"It means happiness in Italian."

Hyun carefully accepted La felicità. The legendary violin used by Yascha Heifetz seemed to resonate as if meeting its new owner.

Gustav, as if expecting this, smiled and looked at Hyun. His wrinkled eyes reflected emotions reminiscent of past memories.

"Would you play for me?"

How could he refuse the eternal maestro's request? As soon as Hyun carefully picked up La felicità, he felt a profound emotional surge as a violinist.

Hyun took his stance in front of the eternal maestro. As his posture flowed seamlessly, La felicità began to shine, just as it did when it was with Yascha Heifetz, who dominated the 20th century.

The first snow of winter had fallen. Hyun and Yooha were leaving footprints together on the freshly fallen snow.

As promised, Yooha had come to Korea as soon as she got into an Ivy League school.

As Hyun imprinted footprints on the snow, he glanced at Yooha and asked,

"Do you still want to be with me?"

At that moment, Yooha squinted her eyes and asked back,

"Oppa, don't you?"

Hyun had thought Yooha's choice might have been a fleeting emotion. The contrast between the ice queen he had met in his previous life and her current self was so stark.

But now, Yooha was smiling more happily than ever. Just by looking at the emotions in her eyes, Hyun could now read all her thoughts.

It was possible because they had each other.

"This is the first time we're hiking together, isn't it?"

As they climbed the mountain, Hyun held Yooha's hand to ensure she didn't struggle.

The winter scenery of Hallasan Mountain was breathtaking, making anyone marvel.

The rocky cliffs, as if sprinkled with sugar, sweetly dazzled the eyes.

Seeing deer frolicking on the snow-covered ground, Yooha laughed gleefully like a child.

The surroundings of snow-covered Hallasan were full of life. This winter kingdom was undoubtedly also awaiting the new sprouts of spring.

"Ah!"

At that moment, Yooha lost her balance while climbing the stone steps. Instinctively, she closed her eyes and screamed.

But instead of falling into the snow, Yooha found herself in Hyun's arms. He had quickly caught her hand and embraced her.

"Clumsy as always."

Hyun patted Yooha's head and helped her stand up again. But Yooha was touched by Hyun's unchanging demeanor since childhood.

"Oppa!"

Yooha hugged Hyun tightly and looked up at him. His chiseled nose, deep eyes, and full lips were perfect for a kiss. Moreover, there were no other hikers around, making it the perfect timing.

Mwah.

Yooha kissed Hyun and, feeling shy, ran ahead quickly. Worried she might fall again, Hyun hurriedly followed her.

The winter mountain was serene. As the wind blew across the snow-covered ridges, it brushed past the cheeks of the two. It felt as if they were the only two people left in this white world.

Hyun held Yooha's hand tightly, determined not to let go, as they walked on. Toward their future together.

"The pine trees are blooming with snow flowers."

Snow flowers had settled on the twisted pine trees.

Pine trees, growing differently based on their environment, were like human lives. Surely, the pine tree in Hyun's heart was also sprouting new branches, having met Yooha.

At that moment, Yooha picked up some snow and sprinkled it over Hyun's head with a smile. Not wanting to be outdone, Hyun did the same. Under the sky, white snowflakes bloomed, blessing the two.

In his previous life, Hyun hadn't known. That spending time with someone could be this happy.
