Following the conductor's fingertips, a sharp tension descended.

The orchestra members played a heavy yet calm melody, as if they were soldiers heading into battle.

The movement, which began with a Largo prelude, was vast and expansive, like looking at a broad landscape.

The clarinet solo stimulated both the eyes and ears, followed by the lyrical scherzo of the orchestra.

The sharp and splendid tone of the orchestra rose like waves under the conductor's direction.

At the end of the sweet melody, a grand march resounded.

"Maestro, you have a visitor."

Spencer, who had finished the rehearsal, looked up. It was because an unexpected guest had come to see him.

The gleaming eyes under the raised eyebrows resembled Spencer's gaze. The deeply etched cheeks and tightly closed lips even made him look cold.

At that moment, Spencer stood up abruptly to greet the guest.

"Maxim Ivanov―!"

Spencer raised his voice with a broad smile. It was simple why someone usually so reserved welcomed him so warmly. They were old friends who had learned conducting together and shared many hardships.

Russia’s Maestro Maxim Ivanov twitched his cheeks and hugged Spencer.

"Spencer, I came to see you while visiting the UK. Actually, I lost track of time enjoying Rachmaninoff's symphony. The London Symphony's reputation is still strong. Conductor Dmitri seems sharper than ever. On the other hand, you seem to have softened over the years, Spencer."

"I've softened?"

"Yes, don't you remember? Back in our Royal School days, what your nickname was. You were so meticulous and harsh about music that even the professors found you difficult."

Maxim and Spencer chatted for a long time, catching up on old times. Among those who had studied conducting together, only the two of them had reached the pinnacle of the world.

It was only natural. Not just anyone could become a world-renowned maestro.

"I want to know about the violinist Hyun. I hear you have a connection with him."

"Violinist Hyun?"

"Yes, I have a student I'm teaching these days who seems to have hit an invisible wall. You know how, in music, one eventually faces limits. But it seems the obstacle isn't himself but violinist Hyun."

Spencer listened intently. He had heard rumors that Maxim Ivanov was training students.

But he never imagined he'd care so much about a student. Considering his personality, it was hard to believe he would train students, let alone care for the next generation.

"Hyun is indeed a remarkable musician. He will be the future conductor inheriting the heart of the London Symphony. That's the only way I can put it. His musical talent is so vast and deep that I can't even measure it."

When Spencer answered without hesitation, Maxim's eyes widened.

Spencer, known for his cold and meticulous nature, had given such a definitive answer.

Moreover, he had hinted that Hyun was being groomed as the successor of the London Symphony.

Achoo―!

Whether it was because I wore a suit for the first time in a while or because someone was talking about me, a sneeze burst out, making me feel awkward.

The suit fit well due to my long limbs. By the way, Barbara Tannenbaum is hosting a gathering of major corporate leaders.

"Manager Kim, which companies have been invited to today's meeting?"

Manager Kim Sang-kook glanced at the rearview mirror and listed the names of the companies. All the top conglomerates in Korea were included, so it was no exaggeration to say that the Korean business world was mobilized.

It was then.

"Dongju?"

Even Dongju, a chemical company, was included. It was quite unexpected.

Just then, the car arrived at the Seungjeongwon of the Jeil Group. This place was where key decisions and major management meetings took place and sometimes served as a guesthouse for meeting domestic and foreign dignitaries.

"What brings you here?"

The security was tight. Given the assets of the people gathered today, it was no exaggeration to say that Korea was mobilized. Manager Kim Sang-kook's face also showed signs of tension.

"Manager, are you okay?"

"It's been a long time since I've been to Seungjeongwon, so I'm nervous. But, representative, you maintain a poker face even looking at this place. I need to learn from you."

The grand and splendid interior of Seungjeongwon was intimidating for first-time visitors. But not for me.

Of course, I had visited this place several times in my past life. Not as a guest, but as a subordinate of the Jeil Group. I had visited Seungjeongwon so many times that I could navigate its layout with my eyes closed.

Just then, the steps of the security guard who was guiding us stopped.

"We've arrived."

Entering the VIP room of the traditional hanok main building, there were guests already seated.

Not only the heads of the top five conglomerates in Korea but also my father, who was the representative of Dongju, were present.

The heads looked at me curiously, and my father stood up with wide eyes.

"Hyun, what brings you here?"

It had happened this way, but I couldn't explain it all here.

Only President Son Il-sun of the Jeil Group seemed to know that I was the representative of VH Company.

"Ahem, Barbara isn't very respectful, is she? I heard she knows this violinist, but to invite him to such an event. It's like a child's play."

At that moment, President Kim Seong-rak of the Dongshin Group glared at me. I wanted to respond, but what could I do? Even Kim Seong-rak, despite his words, didn't leave his seat.

After all, for companies like Dongshin Group and Korean businesses, the Barbara Group would seem like a lifeline capable of distributing significant foreign currency.

Just then.

"Chairwoman Barbara Tannenbaum has arrived."

With the security guard's voice, the lattice door of the VIP room slid open wide.

As Chairwoman Barbara, with her dark brown eyes, walked in, everyone stood up without needing to be prompted.

Especially Kim Seong-rak of the Dongshin Group, who stepped forward, ready to make a first impression.

His thick lips quivered, as if he had prepared a speech.

Huh?

Could it be that Chairwoman Barbara hadn't heard because of Kim Seong-rak's awkward English accent? At that moment, Chairwoman Barbara walked directly toward me.

"The hottest album in the classical world right now?"

Adam Wishaw thought of just one album without hesitation. Hadn't it stirred classical enthusiasts worldwide since its release?

His compositions were enough to stir the emotions of the listeners.

The modulated and splendid tones of the pieces had such rich melodies and sharp compositions that each piece felt like it was composed by a different person.

It was the same feeling one would get from listening to pieces by Beethoven, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, and Paganini.

"Adam, isn't it amazing? The sales are increasing day by day."

Adam nodded at the sales figures of Hyun's album. It was precisely what Austin, the CEO of EMA, had predicted.

Many had been skeptical about EMA's initial shipment volume, even thinking it wouldn't sell out. But what was the result?

"EMA's strategy worked perfectly."

The initial shipment sold out in just a few days, and there was a continuous demand for additional reprints.

Not only in Europe but even in Korea, considered a barren land for classical music, Hyun's album sold like hotcakes, almost like a syndrome.

And what about the U.S., the center of billboard and popular music?

"At this rate, won't we break the RIAA record thanks to Hyun?"

Sharon's excitement wasn't entirely impossible.

According to the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), 5% of the albums sold in the U.S. in a year were classical albums.

But Hyun's album had been breaking records since the beginning of the year. To exaggerate, it was reminiscent of when the legendary Austrian Empress Karas's masterpiece was released.

"Hyun is nineteen this year, right? I'm really curious to see how much he'll grow. Adam, what do you think is the album of the year?"

"The album of the year?"

It might be premature, but why bother thinking about it, when the answer was already evident? It was unfortunate for other classical musicians.

The demons of Gramophone were already naming Hyun's album.

"I deeply thank the representatives of each company for arranging this event for me. I have long considered Korea a prime location for investment in Asia. Though it went through a financial crisis a few years ago, I believe it has the resilience to bounce back soon."

Barbara's fluent English brought faint smiles to the faces of the corporate heads.

They hadn't expected Barbara to speak so positively in this off-the-record setting.

Objectively, Korea had not yet fully escaped the shadow of the financial crisis.

Just then.

"But Korea hasn't completely shaken off that shadow yet. One problem is that there are still many companies unfit to be the country's growth engines."

Kim Seong-rak of Dongshin Group furrowed his brows.

Meanwhile, Son Il-sun of Jeil Group nodded briefly, as if he had anticipated this. I wanted to shout to Kim Seong-rak, "She's talking about you!"

"Ahem. It seems Chairwoman Barbara hasn't fully understood Korea yet. The companies that were detrimental to Korea disappeared like sand in the last financial crisis. You don't need to worry about that."

How could he lie so blatantly without batting an eye? Kim Seong-rak continued to fawn over Barbara. At that moment, Barbara looked at me intently.

"Hyun, what do you think?"

All the heads turned their gaze to me. Especially Kim Seong-rak, who still looked displeased. I cleared my throat a few times and began.

"I partially agree with Chairwoman Barbara. Banks have a fractional reserve system. It means the proportion of customer deposits that banks must keep on hand. Korea might have miscalculated this ratio. Especially if it was abused to benefit certain companies."

I was referring to Dongshin Group. Kim Seong-rak showed clear discomfort.

But what could I do? In my past life, Dongshin Group went bankrupt within a few years after the millennium.

Rumors had it that Kim Seong-rak's embezzlement was involved, but others said the government used him as a scapegoat.

After all, Kim Seong-rak, unusually for a conglomerate head, had ended his life in prison.

"Chairwoman Barbara, please don't take that student's words too seriously. He's a famous violinist but still lacks knowledge in economics and management."

Oh, look at him. Kim Seong-rak was deliberately belittling me. It must be his guilty conscience.

"Mr. Kim, I'm sorry, but I think you should apologize."

"Excuse me?"

"I didn't just ask a student."

Then Barbara looked at me and firmly added.

"I asked the representative of VH Company for his opinion."
