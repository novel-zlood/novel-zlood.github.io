“Grandfather―!”

Son Yooha runs as if she might fall at any moment and snuggles into Chairman Wang's arms. Although it was a short time, it wouldn't have been easy for a young child. Her hands clutching his collar tightly looked like a scene from a reunion of separated families.

“You rascal, that's why I said to wait and go with your grandfather.”

Chairman Wang patted his granddaughter's head. At moments like this, she was unmistakably a child. She was so endearing that it seemed like he could do anything for her.

“Yooha, shouldn't you also greet Hyun's grandfather?”

Son Yooha was startled and lifted her head. Confirming Chairman Yoo, she wiped her moist eyes with her sleeve and quickly greeted him.

Her chubby cheeks turned red with embarrassment. Seeing that, Chairman Yoo and Chairman Wang smiled at each other. That aside.

“Secretary Kim, why are there so many people at the airport?”

He wasn't referring to the general travelers. He meant the security personnel. Looking around, apart from the airport police, there were also military units patrolling.

“For this competition, many national VIPs, including you, Chairman, are arriving. It seems the Belgian side is very concerned about security.”

Chairman Wang was curious. Just how many VIPs were arriving to warrant such intense security?

Looking closely, even the Chairman's entourage was noticeable. Bodyguards in black suits were moving in perfect unison. Anyone observing might think they were mafia bosses.

War of the Stars.

“Truly amazing.”

It was a competition that had garnered attention even before it began, with participants from various countries. But Adam was more astonished by the dignitaries visiting Brussels.

“Newbie, you're very lucky.”

The newcomer standing next to him gulped. Normally, a senior editor should have come, but Adam brought him along. Though cocky, he was undoubtedly enthusiastic. After all, they say to give a rice cake to the disliked child.

“It’s a parade of maestros rarely seen in a lifetime in the classical world.”

It wasn't just one or two. Maestros of the classical world were gathering in Brussels as if they had an appointment.

If one thought this was usual, they were mistaken. Maestros rarely boarded planes to see the performances of rookies. The opposite, maybe. Rumor had it that a massive tycoon from Asia had also arrived.

“E-editor.”

At that moment, the newcomer's eyes were trembling as if an earthquake had hit. Seeing the legendary maestros he had only read about in books up close, he seemed quite shocked.

From the Queen of Strings to the pride of the London Symphony. Each one was a national VIP. There was even an unexpected figure.

“It's like a living museum.”

Even Gustav, the legendary violinist who opened the 20th century with Jascha Heifetz, was there.

Though he no longer played the violin due to old age, he had already left a massive footprint in the classical world as a grand master.

Every maestro showed him respect without hesitation.

Adam thought to himself. It was indeed a wise decision to dismiss the other editors and attend himself. If Sharon knew about this, she might chain-smoke and curse.

As the Bozar Hall was at its hottest moment, the host stepped out. “Dear Your Majesty.”

The Queen Elisabeth competition is a national event.

Not only did the king attend, but there were also about 2,000 audience members. “And ladies and gentlemen.”

There was a slight tremble in the host's voice. Understandable, as the audience was filled with famous personalities.

He had hosted the Queen Elisabeth for decades, but never had there been such attention. Indeed, everyone would be thinking the same.

Maybe Brussels had a peculiar magic.

“Anna, are you okay?”

Anna's face had turned pale. Her already white face looked ashen. She was the second youngest here, including me, so it was understandable she felt immense pressure.

“Hyun, I’m sorry. I’m really okay.”

Anna forced a smile and nodded. She seemed to think she was causing trouble. It seemed she had grown quite attached. Everyone in the waiting room looked at Anna with pity.

Hadn't everyone practiced until their fingers split? No one wanted to see the frail Anna collapse on stage.

“Anna, look at me!”

I stood up and made a funny face. Only then did Anna smile slightly. I felt much relieved. Her pale complexion gradually returned.

“Relax your nerves and focus on the violin till the end.”

At my firm voice, Anna nodded resolutely.

“Anna, look at me too!”

At that moment, Erik from Northern Europe jumped up and made a funny face.

If a bear were to perform tricks, it would look like that. Everyone, including Anna, burst into laughter simultaneously.

Mark, the headmaster of Chappell, who was seated in one corner of the waiting room, felt overwhelmed with emotion.

He had never imagined such warmth would pervade the backstage, which was always cold as ice.

His eyes took in the 12 violinists who were smiling brightly.

“The last performer is the Korean violinist, Kang Hyun.”

At the host's voice, all eyes focused. Soon, a boy walked up the dimly lit stage.

Dressed in a suit that fit perfectly, his gaze was unwavering. As if he had swallowed all the tension in the hall.

Moreover, in his hands was the Stradivarius “Fantasia,” the finest of the fine.

When the rumor turned out to be true, the audience buzzed.

“It’s been a while since Eden smiled so brightly.”

It was the legendary violinist Gustav. Though the special seat was relatively comfortable, he had been sitting for quite a while. Could his aged body endure?

But as if to dispel everyone's worries, Gustav's eyes were shining. His pounding heart was likely no different from Eden's at the conductor's podium.

As the violinist took his position, Eden’s baton cut powerfully through the air.

Bruch Violin Concerto No. 1.

At the first note, Gustav leaned forward. The grand resonance of the orchestra was enveloping the violinist.

Inexperienced violinists often lost their way in such a massive wave. But look at that boy, embracing the orchestra’s melody as if making it his own.

Eden's conducting was freer than ever. It meant he trusted the soloist.

Crunch.

Gustav clenched his wrinkled hand. Eden’s words weren't lies. Hadn't he said there was a violinist who resembled that person?

At first, he hadn't believed it. Such a talent being born again seemed like a miracle. But listening to that melody, it really felt like Jascha Heifetz had returned.

Was it fate’s trick?

Jascha had also performed Bruch’s G minor concerto with an orchestra as a child.

It wasn’t just Gustav who was enchanted. The judges, too, were no longer judges but captivated audience members.

If Bruch were watching this performance, he might have risen from his grave to applaud. With a pleased smile.

After the concerto.

Only the free piece remained.

The audience fixed their gazes on the boy as if time had stopped. The lingering resonance and the chills running through their bodies were still vivid.

They wanted to shout bravo, but seeing the violinist with his eyes closed, everyone held their breath.

“Unaccompanied?”

It was an unaccompanied performance. The orchestra members put down their bows and became audience members, as did Eden.

Under the gentle lighting, the boy holding “Fantasia” looked like a beautiful painting.

Moreover, he was faintly smiling, as if enjoying the moment. Such a decision couldn’t be made without great confidence in front of thousands.

As the boy slowly half-opened his eyes, the silver strings gleamed sharply. At the moment when the fierce bow began to lift.

Zing―!

The scarlet curtain, bathed in moonlight, fluttered.

“Hiccup―!”

Son Yooha, in high spirits, ran to me and hugged me. I had been so nervous performing and receiving an award in front of thousands that my legs were shaking, and I almost fell backward.

Comforting the tearful Son Yooha, I greeted Chairman Wang and Grandfather. My parents also looked deeply moved.

“You were truly amazing, my son.”

Mother said, wiping her tears. Suddenly, thinking about my past life, I felt a lump in my throat.

I put Yooha down and hugged my mother. While Grandfather and Father watched with satisfaction, Chairman Wang looked at me with a complicated expression.

Seeing Chairman Wang like that reminded me of my forgotten task.

‘I must get my hands on Fantasia somehow.’

It wasn’t called a masterpiece for nothing. It resonated as if reading my heart. I’d have to take back my words about borrowing it only for the competition. No matter the cost.

The problem was convincing Chairman Wang. Oh well, I'll think about it in Korea. Right now, there were other urgent matters.

“Mother, may I go greet some other people for a moment?”

The judges, as well as the violinists who made it to the final list with me. And those who took a flight just to see me.

Even among the thousands of audience members, two people stood out distinctly. An elderly man in the special seats had also caught my eye. His sharp gaze was memorable.

At that moment.

“Hyun!”

Anna appeared, her platinum blonde hair fluttering. Her pure white dress suited her so well that she instantly captivated those around her.

Anna took a breath, her green eyes shining. But why did she run? I had planned to greet her later anyway.

“C-congratulations on winning the grand prize!”

“Thanks, Anna.”

Not just thanks. My days at Chappell had brought many turning points in my life. I felt many emotions towards Anna, who was part of that.

Moreover, they were friends who helped me achieve the goal of military exemption. This gratitude would stay with me forever.

“Be sure to visit Moscow later!”

Was she officially inviting me? I readily nodded. After all, there’s no better travel experience than having a local guide.

At that moment, Anna hesitated, unable to continue speaking. Her face was flushed. Was she feeling unwell again?

“Hyun, and….”

Huh?

“Thank you for your help.” Smooch.

Anna suddenly gave me a light kiss on the cheek. People around us looked on in surprise.
