Would people with obsessive-compulsive disorder be like this? Their fingertips are as sharp as the tip of a gladiator's sword standing at a crossroads, not allowing a single mistake, and their pupils move incessantly.

The charisma of the young conductor was extraordinary. His conducting, as if measured with a ruler, and his innate talent made the members tense.

With a shallow breath, dozens of members created a melody in perfect unison.

Crosis Elba (Iron-Blooded).

The members called him the Iron-Blooded Maestro. His fingertips were firm as if he were a general going to war, and his eyes gleamed endlessly.

And what about his skills? There were even rumors that he was the reincarnation of the world-famous Maestro Maxim Ivanov.

The members focused their gaze on the conductor's fingertips, as if standing in the middle of a battlefield.

With the bold conducting, the members' breaths reached their throats.

Crunch.

At that moment, the conductor's left hand crossed the air and clenched into a fist.

"That's it for today."

With fluent Russian, the conductor turned and walked out. Only then did the members breathe a sigh of relief.

Usually, he would have found the members who made mistakes and had them practice repeatedly.

His skill was so precise that even members who initially did not recognize the young conductor quickly fell silent. There was no doubt about his ability.

Hooâ€”

Baek Junghoon swept his face with his long fingers. The tension fell away with the beads of sweat.

In his mind, he replayed the rehearsal like a Go player reviewing a game.

He couldn't stop thinking about the mistakes in the first movement's introduction and the scherzo of the third movement.

He always pursued perfection, but it felt like there was always an unseen stumbling block.

There is a saying that conducting can never be perfect. But when he thought of this, one person came to mind harshly.

"Hyun."

The young maestro who conducted directly at the British royal family years ago. He couldn't fully grasp his greatness until he learned to conduct.

But as he learned to conduct, he finally understood why so many maestros around the world were enthusiastic about Hyun.

Even though he had been on stage as a guest conductor dozens, hundreds of times, Baek Junghoon thought he had not yet caught up with the past Kang Hyun. Such was the greatness of the conducting at the British royal family.

Baek Junghoon pulled out the score once more. The thick beads of sweat and the calluses blooming like flowers on his palms testified to his efforts. Hadn't he stayed late into the night, wrestling with the score even after rehearsals ended?

Baek Junghoon was looking at an invisible opponent beyond himself.

Like a child who seemed to receive endless love from the god of music. That's why he brought both joy and despair to so many conductors.

Baek Junghoon gripped the baton fiercely with his long fingers, almost groaning.

"Kang Hyun, what do you think about this case?"

The old professor's gaze was as sharp as ever, like an eagle eyeing its prey.

It was a famous case involving both corporate and civil procedure law. It was a problem that prospective bar exam candidates couldn't help but know.

It was a famous problem that appeared in the 1997 second bar exam, causing many candidates to despair.

"You can speak based on common sense. I'm not asking for a legal interpretation from someone who's not a law major. Just speak comfortably."

At some point, the law class had become a forum for debate between the old professor and me. The students watched us with keen interest.

In the end, it was I who surrendered. As I provided a common-sense interpretation of the case, the old professor's eyes filled with satisfaction and excitement.

It was because the problem was difficult to answer even for a senior law student.

As the class was about to end, the old professor habitually grabbed me.

"Kang Hyun, do you still have no intention of transferring? Your ability to interpret legal principles and understand arguments is too good to be just a hobby. I've never seen a student grasp the discipline of law as well as you."

"Professor, I want to pursue music."

"Hmm."

At the mention of music, the professor fell silent. After all, my skills as a violinist and conductor were already widely known in Korea.

Nevertheless, the professor's gaze was filled with regret, like someone looking at a lost love. But would I go back to law like in my past life?

"Oh, Kang Hyun. It looks like you'll get an A+ in this law class. I heard Professor Jung rarely gives more than a B+, but this time you'll rewrite history. As expected of the top student."

As I walked briskly, Kim Daewoo, who was as big as a bear, approached me with a grin.

As the department representative, he had been dragged here and there, and he seemed to have grown even bigger than when I first saw him.

"Hyun, how about a beer with the classmates tonight?"

"I can't, I have a prior engagement."

"Again? Hey, you're like a celebrity among the classmates. It's hard to even see your face. You haven't been coming to class properly for the past few days. Yet, you always do well on exams. I feel like I'm going to get double-barreled pistols at this rate."

Somehow, I was living a busier life than in my past one. Because of a single word from Chairman Barbara, not only big corporations but even the Blue House officials occasionally sought me out.

Fortunately, Kim Sangguk, the chief of staff, had taken over that role. I could still hear him complaining about needing to hire more staff. The scale seemed to be growing more than I had expected.

It was then.

'He looks familiar.'

There was a foreigner standing in front of the college building. His cold eyes under raised eyebrows reminded me of the view of Vladivostok. His frowning expression looked very much like Director Alexei of the Moscow Conservatory.

At that moment, our eyes met.

Huh?

The middle-aged man with cold eyes started walking towards me. His physique was so imposing that Kim Daewoo, standing next to me, swallowed nervously.

"Violinist Hyun?"

"Yes."

"I'm Maxim Ivanov."

When Kim Daewoo's eyes widened at the fluent Russian, I was even more surprised by the name Maxim Ivanov.

Wasn't he a world-famous maestro? At one time, he was compared to the Empress Karas of Austria.

However, in my past life, he had secluded himself in Russia, causing much heartache among classical music enthusiasts.

* * *

"A world-class conductor?"

The teacup with a flower petal floating in it shook.

"Adam, it's too cruel to ask me such a question. I'm too old to judge that."

"If not you, Maestro, then who can judge?"

"It's not for me to judge music, but for the audience. But if you ask me to name a few world-class conductors, I can confidently name a few."

The eternal maestro Gustav lifted the teacup with his liver-spotted hand. His wrinkled eyes were reminiscing about the past.

Indeed, Gustav's life was like a textbook of modern classical music.

"The Empress of Austria, Karas; Maxim Ivanov of Russia; Christopher of Norway; and Wang Wei of China."

"They're all maestros who are no longer active."

"How can I evaluate those who are still active? Aside from them, the remaining maestros are undoubtedly great. But of those I've met, these four were the best."

It was high praise. It was a compliment from the eternal maestro himself.

"The virtues of a conductor are perseverance and patience. Many musicians wrestle with their instruments, but a conductor must harmonize with many members. Moreover, a conductor must understand the characteristics of many instruments and even the minor habits of individuals. It's not an easy task to encompass all that. Sometimes, it even requires letting go of oneself."

"Letting go?"

"When I was pursuing the path of a conductor, I once visited Professor Auer. Although he had already turned me away once, I didn't mind. There's no royal road to learning. Like that day I was soaked in the rain when I lost to Yasha, I sought out Professor Auer. Only then did he accept me, saying, 'You've finally let go of everything.'"

It was well-known that the eternal maestro Gustav had studied under Leopold Auer with Yasha Heifetz in his youth. But I hadn't known there was such a hidden story.

Adam's eyes sparkled as he continued with the next question.

"Maestro, are there any emerging conductors you have your eye on?"

"Of course, new conductors these days are growing rapidly. If I think of those two, they're incomparable to the past. Even Professor Auer would have applauded if he had seen those two."

The eternal maestro Gustav smiled faintly as he continued.

"Those two are intertwined by fate. One is a genius, and the other is a genius who watches him."

"Two conductors?"

At home, I recalled what Maxim Ivanov had said. He had proposed that I conduct with Baek Junghoon.

Two conductors on stage with one symphony. It was hard to believe, and I never dreamed that the world-renowned maestro Maxim Ivanov would come to Korea personally for his disciple.

"Baek Junghoon."

The more I thought about Ivanov's words, the less I believed it. He said Baek Junghoon seemed to be blocked by an invisible wall. Moreover, he said that wall was none other than me, which naturally made me curious.

In my past life, Baek Junghoon was the Iron-Blooded Maestro himself. Just being on stage created tension, and his charisma overwhelmed not only the audience but the entire concert hall.

For such a person to feel walled by me.

"Hyun, are you busy?"

Just then, Director Im Hyera visited my studio. Judging by the documents in her hand, there seemed to be some issue.

"Gramophone contacted us."

"Gramophone?"

"Yes, they want you to participate in the music awards ceremony where they present the Record of the Year award. They were so earnest, sending a written request and even calling."

Since releasing an album, I had received invitations from notable classical music events. However, I had always used my schedule as an excuse and never attended.

Of course, unlike performing on stage, spending an entire day smiling at people and sitting there was not exactly appealing.

Moreover, I had more important things to do.

"I'll think about it."

"Sure, but try to attend this time. EMA's representative Austin also wants you to attend the Gramophone music awards. You're quite well-known among European musicians now."

Director Im Hyera wasn't lying. As a musician and composer, I was getting love calls from famous European musicians. There were even people who came from Europe just to get my music.

But I never gave away my music. Each piece was like my own child.

Pitter-patter.

After Director Im Hyera left, raindrops started falling outside the window. As the night deepened, the raindrops became heavier, and the inspiration flowed endlessly. The notes on the staff were being drawn like a picture.

Knock, knock.

At that moment, there was a knock on the studio door. It was past the time when all the staff, except the security guard, had gone home. Wondering what it could be, I got up and opened the door.

"Hyung?"

There stood Baek Junghoon, soaked to the bone, with eyes that seemed wet.
