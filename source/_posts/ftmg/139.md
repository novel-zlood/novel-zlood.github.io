“Son-ga, what do you mean by that?”

It was an unexpected story.

“Just as I said, Hyun signed a contract with Barbara Mining in the U.S. He even met directly with Chairman Barbara.”

“Are you talking about the Barbara Group?”

“Yes, the Jewish chairman who wielded the most powerful influence under the gold standard.”

A sigh of disbelief escaped from Chairman Yoo's mouth as he sat on the sickbed. His face was visibly startled.

The reason was simple. He couldn’t believe it.

You know how people say they can’t speak when they’re too shocked? This was exactly that moment.

‘Chairman Barbara?’

There was no way the two grandfathers didn’t know Chairman Barbara. He was one of the most influential tycoons in America.

Just like the Oracle of Omaha, he was known as a genius investor.

He was not someone you could easily meet just because you wanted to. People even joked that he was harder to meet than someone from the White House.

It was incomprehensible.

They thought they knew Hyun's assets like the back of their hands because they managed the accounting and tax affairs for the Jaeil Foundation.

Moreover, what good were tens of millions of won in a country like the U.S.? It was almost like going to America penniless.

They had suspected that the sudden trip to America wasn’t just for attending a premiere, but still, signing a contract with the Barbara Group?

“Son-ga, do you know what the contract entailed?”

“That part I don’t know. I was just keeping an eye out for anything that might happen in America. Who would have guessed he’d meet Chairman Barbara? If you find out how they met, you’ll be very surprised. You might even scream when you find out what Chairman Barbara said about Hyun.”

Chairman Wang started recounting everything Hyun had done in America.

The audacity to win a lunch with Sotheby’s in LA for a million dollars, and even Chairman Barbara calling Hyun a ‘friend.’

“Old man, I think Hyun is made to be a businessman. Isn’t it known that Chairman Barbara only calls someone a friend when they are business partners? How did he manage to win over that sly old man?”

There were many things to be curious about.

Even when he won over Kim Sang-guk, the head of the strategic planning office, they knew he was something, but to think he would do the same with Chairman Barbara, a known American tycoon.

And the contract was with Barbara Mining.

Although Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo had been at the forefront of business for many years, they couldn’t grasp what kind of contract Hyun had made.

“By the way, how long does that rascal plan to stay in America while his grandfather is bedridden?”

“Son-ga, are you that curious about the contract details?”

“Isn’t it natural? Who would have thought he’d catch a big fish, not a small fry, in America? Even if we sent Ilsung right now, he wouldn’t be able to establish a business partnership with Chairman Barbara.”

Chairman Yoo thought of his grandson. Didn’t he grasp his hand before leaving for America?

He almost revealed to his other children that he wasn’t sick.

“Hyun already knows.”

“What?”

“He knows that I’m in my right mind.”

Grandfather, please move your body often secretly from the uncles.

It must feel like being a sudden star. Being the protagonist of a party attended by famous Hollywood actors. Had he ever received such intense attention from so many people outside of the stage?

He had to greet far more people than he had when preparing to run for Congress in his past life. His hand still ached from all the handshakes.

“Mr. Kim, don’t you like the food?”

It was a typical American brunch with hotcakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and roasted potatoes. It was a little salty but not inedible.

However, Kim Sang-guk had been staring blankly without really eating.

“Hyun, was that really Chairman Barbara I saw at the party yesterday?”

“It probably was.”

“It still feels like a dream. But didn’t Chairman Barbara call you ‘friend’?”

Of course, as a business student, Kim Sang-guk would know Chairman Barbara. He was a living legend who began to dominate America at a young age.

He was the one who caught Kim Sang-guk’s attention away from the famous Hollywood actresses.

“I know you had lunch with Chairman Barbara, but how did you become friends in just a week?”

Kim Sang-guk’s eyes were filled with curiosity as if he had experienced something strange. Other party attendees were the same.

Even Director Jean-Pierre looked as if he’d seen a ghost when Chairman Barbara suddenly appeared.

Not to mention, didn’t he donate a million dollars for my performance?

“I had a lot of talks with Chairman Barbara over lunch. We discussed how the huge institution called America would change, the flow of East Asia, and many financial derivatives.”

“What?”

“As a result, Chairman Barbara thought highly of me. He saw my future value and decided to make a kind of contract with me. I can’t tell you the details yet because it’s one of Chairman Barbara’s conditions.”

Surely, if the news about the mining area exploration spread, Barbara Mining's stock would skyrocket.

Hearing the word contract, Kim Sang-guk showed a worried expression.

He knew how powerful signing a piece of paper could be.

You’re wondering how a mere seventeen-year-old could know such things?

‘Tsk.’

Recalling his past life, he felt bitter. How many contracts had he seen as the deputy head of the legal team at Jeil Group?

His specialty was artfully twisting legal interpretations of each clause to his advantage.

That didn’t mean he had openly tried to outsmart Chairman Barbara. Their meeting wasn’t meant to be a one-time thing.

“I plan to go to New York.”

“New York?”

The old professors from Juilliard had been so eager for him to visit their alma mater that he could still see the passionate looks in their eyes in his sleep.

Of course, that wasn’t the only reason. There were people he had to meet.

“Not Korea?”

“I can’t go to Korea right now. It’s too soon.”

The reason for not returning to Korea was simple. His two uncles and their spouses were probably having the time of their lives right now.

They might be revealing their hidden fangs and eyeing Dongju at every opportunity like hyenas.

To properly trap them, it was better for him to stay in America.

“They need to be completely off guard.”

So they wouldn’t realize they were the prey.

“Shlyshkom Shuma (It’s damn noisy)!”

Dr. Tikhonov frowned deeply.

The usually good-natured man was speaking harsh Russian out of frustration because Yu Bum-kyung had been visiting the lab every day.

Even though he was the son of the owner’s family, wasn’t he just a jobless rascal now?

“Ah, I told you I just wanted to see the research results!”

As the saying goes, the loudest one wins.

When Chairman Yoo was still around, this rascal couldn’t even come near Dongju, but now he was showing his true colors.

With his thick double eyelids glaring, there was no way researchers who had spent their lives studying chemistry could handle him.

“Dr. Tikhonov, was your report true?”

“Eto Pravda (It’s true).”

“Speak in Korean, not Russian!”

Though he wanted to throw him out immediately, Yu Bum-kyung was still part of the owner’s family.

Dr. Tikhonov wondered how such a person could have come from Chairman Yoo. He wanted to show this pompous second son the bitter taste of Mother Russia.

“Stop it.”

“What?”

“I said stop.”

Team Leader Kang appeared like a savior. He was Hyun’s father and the one entirely in charge of new material development.

Even the unruly Yu Bum-kyung visibly hesitated.

It was because there were rumors that the two had a past altercation.

“Kang, you’d better conduct yourself well. How long do you think your father will protect you? If you don’t want to be left out in the cold, you should start getting along with your older brother. Hmph—!”

Yu Bum-kyung hurriedly said his piece and left, probably fearing another confrontation.

Team Leader Kang sighed deeply and bowed to the researchers. Though it wasn’t his fault, he felt compelled to apologize.

“Dr. Tikhonov, did he ask about anything?”

“He asked about the commercialization potential of graphene. I reported that it’s currently minimal. He seemed very pleased.”

“What?”

Dr. Tikhonov answered in fluent Korean.

He wasn’t wrong. The development of graphene was still in its early stages, so its commercialization potential was low.

But based on the accumulated data, they would eventually succeed in commercializing it.

Finally understanding Dr. Tikhonov’s intentions, Team Leader Kang smiled.

“Yooha—!”

Michelle waved her hand energetically as she approached. Her face was beaming, likely because she had a date with her boyfriend today.

“Michelle, do you smile like that in front of Michael too?”

“Why?”

“You shouldn’t make it too obvious that you like him.”

Didn’t they learn in love theory that if you’re not going to have a burning love like Romeo and Juliet for a week, you need to play hard to get a bit?

In that sense, young Michelle seemed willing to give everything, her liver and gallbladder included, with hearts in her eyes.

“Yooha, I’m going to watch ‘Paganini’ at the cinema with my boyfriend today. I heard it’s really fun. There's a lot of buzz about it.”

“Paganini?”

“Yes, they say Alessandro is incredibly cool in it. Yooha, you should go with Dean. He’s come looking for you several times to watch a movie together.”

It was well-known in the prestigious Phillips that Son Yooha was very popular.

Despite her outstanding looks and athletic skills, she had repeatedly rejected advances coldly. Even now, it was the same.

Watching her from the side, Michelle clicked her tongue.

“Is it because of that guy in Korea?”

“No, Dean is just annoying.”

“Are you planning to go to Korea during winter break too?”

Son Yooha shook her head. She would have loved to return to Korea for every holiday starting from Thanksgiving, but she couldn’t. She had to study not only school subjects but also imperial studies for her future role.

What had helped her endure the tough life in a foreign country was probably a single photo in her wallet.

‘I’m definitely going to watch it with oppa.’

Didn’t they say Hyun was responsible for the sound mixing of the movie Paganini? Yooha vowed to watch the movie with him, whenever that would be.

On one hand, she was resentful. He hadn’t even written her a single letter.

“Everyone at Phillips is dying to know who the guy you like is. They’re all wondering who could win the heart of someone as cold as you, Yooha.”

Michelle exaggerated her gestures as she spoke. Yooha also missed him, but what could she do? He was far away.

As Son Yooha and Michelle walked towards the steps outside the school gate.

Huh?

Son Yooha’s steps halted on the stairs. She blinked repeatedly, almost doubting her eyes.

She wondered if it was a side effect of staring too intently at the photo in her wallet during breaks, but it didn’t seem like it.

Even after blinking several times, someone was definitely looking at her from the bottom of the long stairs.

It was only natural that Son Yooha was so shocked.

“Hyun oppa?”
