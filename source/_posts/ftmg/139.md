"Son Jangwon, what do you mean by that?"

It was an unexpected story.

"Just as I said, Hyun has signed a contract with Barbara Tannenbaum in the United States. And he met her directly."

"Are you talking about the Barbara Group?"

"Yes, I'm talking about the Jewish chairwoman who wielded the most powerful influence during the gold standard."

A sigh of disbelief escaped from Chairman Yoo's mouth, who was sitting on the sickbed. His face was evidently surprised.

The reason was simple. It was hard to believe.

They say that when a person is too surprised, they can't speak. This was exactly that moment.

"Chairwoman Barbara?"

There was no way the two grandfathers didn't know Chairwoman Barbara. She was one of the wealthiest individuals with the greatest influence in America.

Just like the Sage of Omaha, she was known as an investment genius.

She wasn't someone you could easily meet just because you wanted to. People jokingly said she was harder to meet than someone from the White House.

It was incomprehensible.

He thought he had a clear grasp of Kang Hyun's assets since he was handling the accounting and tax affairs for the Jael Foundation.

Moreover, what use would tens of billions of won be in a country like the United States? In a way, it was no different from choosing to go to America with empty pockets.

While he guessed that the sudden trip to America wasn't simply for attending a premiere, still, a contract with the Barbara Group?

"Son Jangwon, do you know the contents of the contract?"

"I don't know that far. I was just keeping an eye on what might happen in America. Who would have known he would meet Chairwoman Barbara? If you find out how he met her, you'll be very surprised. And if you find out what she called Hyun, you might even scream."

Chairman Wang began recounting what Kang Hyun had done in America.

From boldly winning a lunch at LA Sotheby's for a million dollars to Chairwoman Barbara personally calling Kang Hyun her "friend."

"Old man, no matter how you look at it, Hyun is meant to be a businessman. It's known that Chairwoman Barbara only calls someone a friend when they are equal business partners. How did that sly old man manage to win her over?"

There were many curiosities.

Even when he had won over Director Kim Sang-guk from the Strategic Planning Office, he knew he was a sharp guy. But to think he could even win over Chairwoman Barbara, known as a great magnate in America.

Moreover, wasn't the subject of the contract Barbara Mining?

Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo had been leading their businesses from the forefront for many years, but at this moment, they couldn't grasp what kind of contract Kang Hyun had made.

"By the way, how long is that guy planning to stay in America while his grandfather is lying sick in bed?"

"Son Jangwon, are you that curious about the contract's contents?"

"Isn't it obvious? Who would have thought he could catch the biggest fish, not some small fry, in America? Even if I send Ilsun right now, he wouldn't be able to establish a business partnership with Chairwoman Barbara."

Chairman Yoo recalled his grandson. Didn't he grasp his hand and speak before leaving for America?

He almost revealed to his other children that he wasn't sick.

"Hyun already knows."

"What?"

"He knows that my mind is still clear."

Grandfather, frequently move your body secretly from your uncles.

This must be what it feels like to be a shooting star. Being the star of a party attended by famous Hollywood actors. Had he ever received such intense attention from so many people outside of the stage?

He had to greet far more people than when he was preparing to become a congressman in his past life. His hand still ached from all the handshakes.

"Director Kim, doesn't it suit your taste?"

It was a typical American brunch with pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and roasted potatoes. It was a bit salty but not inedible.

However, Director Kim Sang-guk had been staring blankly without eating properly since earlier.

"Hyun, the person I saw at the party yesterday was Chairwoman Barbara, right?"

"Probably, yes."

"It still feels like a dream. But didn't Chairwoman Barbara call you her 'friend'?"

Of course, as a business major, Director Kim Sang-guk knew Chairwoman Barbara. She was a great magnate who started dominating America at a young age. She was like a living legend.

She was the one who had immediately diverted Director Kim Sang-guk's attention from all the famous Hollywood actresses.

"How can you become friends with Chairwoman Barbara in just a week, even if you had lunch with her?"

Kim Sang-guk's eyes were filled with curiosity, as if he had experienced a mysterious story. Other people at the party felt the same.

Even Director Jean-Pierre looked like he had seen a ghost when Chairwoman Barbara suddenly appeared.

Didn't she say she donated a million dollars for my performance?

"I had a lot of conversations with Chairwoman Barbara during lunch. We talked about how the huge entity called America would change in the future, the trend in East Asia, and many financial derivatives."

"What?"

"As a result, Chairwoman Barbara thought highly of me. She saw my future value and decided to make a kind of contract. I can't tell you the details yet. It's one of the conditions set by Chairwoman Barbara."

Of course, if the news about the mining in the exploration area became known, the stock price of Barbara Mining would soar.

At the word "contract," Director Kim Sang-guk showed a worried expression.

Because he knew how powerful it was to sign a piece of paper.

How do I, a mere seventeen-year-old, know such things well?

'Tsk.'

Recalling his past life, he felt bitter. How many contracts had he seen as the deputy manager of the Jael Group's legal team?

His specialty was cleverly twisting each clause's legal interpretation to his advantage.

That didn't mean he was blatantly trying to outsmart Chairwoman Barbara. His meeting with her wasn't meant to be a one-time thing.

"I plan to go to New York for now."

"New York?"

The old professors of Juilliard School of Music had been so eager for him to visit his alma mater that their intense gazes still lingered in his dreams.

Of course, that wasn't the only reason. There was someone he needed to meet.

"Not Korea?"

"I can't go back to Korea right now. It's not the right time yet."

The reason for not entering the country was simple. His two uncles and their families were probably having the time of their lives right now.

They might be revealing their hidden fangs day after day, eyeing Dongju. Like hyenas greedily eyeing their prey.

To set the trap properly, it was better for him to stay in America.

"They need to be completely off guard."

So they wouldn't realize they were the prey.

"Shlyshkom shumno! (It's terribly noisy!)"

Dr. Tikhonov frowned deeply.

The reason why he, usually known for his good nature, was speaking irritably in Russian was this: Yoo Beom-gyeong had been visiting the research institute almost every day.

Though he was the son of the owner family, he was now nothing more than a rogue without a title.

"Ah, I told you I just want to see the research results—!"

As they say, the one with the loudest voice wins.

When Chairman Yoo was in good health, this rogue couldn't even come near Dongju. Now, he was showing his true colors.

With his thick double eyelids glaring, the researchers, who had spent their lives in chemical research, couldn't possibly handle him.

"Dr. Tikhonov, is the report you submitted true?"

"Eto pravda. (It's true.)"

"Speak in Korean, not Russian!"

Though he wanted to kick him out right away, he was still a person connected to the owner family.

Dr. Tikhonov wondered how on earth someone like him could be Chairman Yoo's offspring. He was itching to show the second son, who was outright arrogant, the harsh reality of Mother Russia.

"Stop it."

"What?"

"I said, stop it."

Team Leader Kang appeared like a savior. He was Kang Hyun's father and the one entrusted with full authority over new material development.

Even Yoo Beom-gyeong, who had been acting like an untamed rogue, hesitated noticeably.

It was also because, as he had heard, there had been a confrontation between the two.

"Kang, you'd better behave. How long do you think your father will protect you? If you don't want to end up empty-handed overnight, you'd better start being good to the eldest brother. Ahem—!"

Yoo Beom-gyeong quickly left after saying what he wanted, perhaps fearing another confrontation.

Team Leader Kang let out a deep sigh and bowed to the researchers. It wasn't even his fault, but still.

"Dr. Tikhonov, did he ask anything before leaving?"

"He asked about the commercialization potential of graphene. I reported that the possibility is currently low. He seemed very pleased."

"Excuse me?"

Dr. Tikhonov answered in fluent Korean.

He wasn't wrong. Graphene was still in its early development stage, so its commercialization potential was naturally low.

However, based on the accumulated data, they would surely succeed in commercialization in the future.

Finally understanding Dr. Tikhonov's intentions, Team Leader Kang smiled brightly.

"Yooha—!"

Michelle raised her hand high and approached with a big voice. Her face was adorned with a full smile, likely because she had a date with her boyfriend today.

"Michelle, do you smile like that even in front of Michael?"

"Why?"

"You shouldn't show that you like the other person too much."

Didn't you learn that in Romance 101? Unless you're going to have a burning love like Romeo and Juliet for a week, you need to play it cool and push and pull appropriately.

In that regard, the young Michelle seemed ready to give away her heart and soul, with hearts in her eyes.

"Yooha, I'm going to the movies with my boyfriend today to watch 'Paganini.' It's supposed to be really fun, and the reviews are amazing."

"Paganini?"

"Yes, it's said that Alessandro is incredibly charming in it. It's a big hit. Yooha, you should go with Dean. Dean has asked you several times to go to the movies with him."

Everyone at the prestigious Phillips School knew that Son Yooha was popular.

Despite her outstanding looks and excellent athletic skills, she had repeatedly turned down advances from many admirers with cold rejections. It was the same now.

Michelle, who was observing her from the side, clicked her tongue.

"Is it because of that person in Korea?"

"No, Dean is just unappealing."

"Are you planning to go to Korea again for this winter break?"

Son Yooha shook her head. Although she wanted to return to Korea every holiday starting from Thanksgiving, she couldn't. She had not only school classes but also had to learn imperial studies for succession.

The only thing that had helped her endure the tough life in a foreign country was perhaps a single photo in her wallet.

"I'll definitely watch it with oppa."

Didn't they say that Kang Hyun was responsible for the sound recording of the movie 'Paganini'? Son Yooha vowed that she would watch the movie with him someday.

On the other hand, she also felt resentful. He hadn't even sent her a letter.

"I'm really curious about the man that Yooha likes so much. All the students at Phillips must feel the same. Who could have won the heart of cold Yooha?" Michelle said with exaggerated hand gestures. Although Son Yooha also wanted to see him, what could she do? They were far apart in different countries.

As Son Yooha and Michelle moved toward the stairs outside the school gate.

Huh?

Son Yooha's steps halted on the staircase. She blinked repeatedly as if she couldn't believe her eyes.

She wondered if it was a side effect of staring too intently at the photo in her wallet during break times, but it didn't seem like it.

No matter how many times she blinked, someone was indeed standing at the end of the long staircase, looking at her.

It was natural for Son Yooha to be this surprised.

"Hyun oppa?"

The Hyun oppa she had longed for was there.
