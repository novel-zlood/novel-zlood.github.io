Producer Kim Dahyun skillfully helped Professor Bianca relax.

When an ordinary person faces a broadcast camera, nine times out of ten, they freeze up. 

Of course, who wouldn't be nervous knowing that many people would be watching them? However...

"Shooting a performance on stage and this are quite different. Fortunately, I'm getting used to it gradually. At first, the camera lights felt like Medusa's head."

Professor Bianca was using her years of experience to ease her tension. Before long, her eyes became as sharp as when she usually dealt with her students.

"First question. You are the head of the violin department. How did you feel when you first met Hyun? Given that he's already quite well-known in the media, you must have had high expectations."

"It would be a lie to say I didn't have expectations. He was loved by the conductor known as the heart of London and even by the legendary maestro Karas. There were even rumors that Mozart had been reincarnated, right?"

High expectations often lead to great disappointment. But...

"Hyun exceeded our high expectations. Especially during the concert, I confirmed his skills with my own eyes. There are many geniuses in the world. Most of them are self-centered and selfish. At least those I have seen in music were like that. But Hyun was different. Especially the way he improved Tommy's skills in such a short time was unbelievable. It wasn't the behavior of a selfish young genius. If I had to describe it in one sentence."

Professor Bianca nodded briefly and added, "Master."

The image of the trio was still vivid in Professor Bianca's mind. 

Of course, the performances of Kang Hyun and Sabrina were outstanding. 

But what drew Professor Bianca's attention the most was definitely Tommy, who played the cello. 

She couldn't believe how much his musical style had changed in such a short time. No professor at the Royal Academy of Music could perform such magical teaching.

"You might think I'm exaggerating. Looking at your face, it seems you think I'm praising Hyun too much."

"Did it show a bit? Actually, I'm a fan of Kang Hyun, but hearing such praise from you makes me feel overwhelmed. I've heard from the students that you are very strict."

"It's true that I treat students harshly. Especially in music. Also, you will see with your own eyes today whether I'm exaggerating or not."

As curiosity spread across Producer Kim Dahyun's face, Professor Bianca said, "Hyun has a very interesting task today."

* * *

"Teaching students?" 

Tommy nodded briefly at Kang Hyun's question.

"Originally, only the most outstanding seniors have done it, but this time the professors pointed to you and me. We will be guiding students under fifteen who hope to enter the Royal Academy of Music. I'm really nervous."

Tommy's face was full of tension. His freckles trembled like aspen leaves. In contrast, Kang Hyun looked completely unconcerned. 

It was only natural. Compared to Tommy, Hyun had much more experience teaching music to others. 

"You just need to give personal guidance on the pieces the students want. Especially, the students on your side have been informed and have given their permission for today's filming, so you don't need to worry."

Professor Albert turned around without further explanation. 

Kang Hyun and Tommy each opened the door to the practice rooms where their students were waiting. The practice room was much larger than usual, and students who looked much younger than Sabrina were waiting.

As Kang Hyun and the filming director entered, the children's faces tensed up. 

"I'm Hyun, and I'll be guiding you all today. Don't be too nervous. The more nervous you are, the slower your fingers will relax."

When Hyun smiled and spoke, the female students blushed and nodded vigorously. 

The male students were no different. Hyun looked at the five young students, thinking deeply about how to guide them. 

"Shall we have each of you play the piece you want?"

At Hyun's gentle instruction, a female student stood up. 

"Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4, 1st movement, very good."

Hyun smiled contentedly as he received the sheet music from the female student. 

Soon, the female student stood up nervously, placed the violin on her shoulder, and assumed her posture. 

Even though she was young, she was definitely a violinist. As soon as she lifted the bow, her eyes changed. 

Zzing.

To the filming director, who was a layman in classical music, the melody sounded quite cheerful and lively. 

Moreover, the flashy movements of the bow and the fingers flitting between the strings clearly showed how much the young girl had practiced. 

But how much time had passed? Hyun suddenly raised his hand. 

"Good, that's enough."

Hyun stood up and approached the girl. After closely examining her fingers and the violin bow, he sat back down and said, 

"You have a bad habit."

What habit was he talking about?

"You trust the sheet music too much."

* * *

The more Producer Kim Dahyun checked the filming footage, the more Professor Bianca's words echoed in his mind. 

Hyun was definitely making the younger students feel comfortable and relaxed, but not when it came to music. 

Gulp.

Producer Kim Dahyun's hands were sweating as he watched, so sharp was Hyun's gaze. 

Hyun's teaching method was completely different from that of Tommy, who was teaching the cello. Hyun immediately pointed out the students' problems as if he had given such lessons countless times before.

-Again.

The girl's face quickly crumpled. She thought she had played well, but Hyun firmly shook his head. 

-Again.

Under repeated corrections, the girl's face turned red and blue. It made sense since Hyun kept making her play again without explaining what was wrong. 

But the girl endured her frustration and played the violin again.

-Let me have the violin for a moment.

In the end, Hyun took the violin. The girl's face was a mix of frustration and excitement. She must have been thinking, "Let's see how well he plays."

Hyun played the same Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4 that the girl had just played, mimicking her bowing and finger movements exactly.

-This is your performance just now.

And then,

-This is my performance now.

As soon as he finished speaking, the melody that came from the bow and strings was completely different. It was like playing a completely different piece; the color of the melody had changed.

Not only was the finger relaxation precise, but it also seemed as if there was no space between the strings, dancing freely.

-Your bowing technique is not yet familiar, and your fingers are short, which makes it difficult to press the strings and achieve precise harmonies. But the most fundamental problem is that you're misunderstanding the piece. If you blindly follow the instructions in the sheet music, you might think you're playing diligently, but the audience will find it boring. The most important thing is the expressiveness of the piece.

The atmosphere of the piece kept changing. It was hard to believe it was the same Mozart piece the girl had just played. 

Even after that, Hyun continued to provide detailed guidance to the girl. 

Originally scheduled for a brief three-hour session, Hyun invested the entire day to guide each of the five young students without missing anyone.

After the long, uninterrupted lesson, the filming director quietly asked Hyun, 

"Why did you work so hard to guide the young students? The cello session next door ended hours ago."

Hyun replied simply, 

-Potential.

Looking at the camera, Hyun added,

-I don't know how many of them will continue with music. Some may give up halfway. But if today I could ignite even the smallest spark of potential in one of them, it was entirely worth it. It was an honor to meet these future great violinists.

"Tommy, did you put something in your hair?"

Tommy's hair was neatly combed today, probably with pomade. 

Tommy, feeling shy, touched his nose and replied to Sabrina, "It's for the filming."

Before long, the filming team approached Tommy and Sabrina. 

"Tommy, do you know where Hyun is?"

"Isn't he in the dormitory?"

"No, we went there early this morning, but he wasn't there."

At that moment, Sabrina nudged Tommy's side. 

"Tommy, if it's Hyun, he must be there."

"Oh, right! He was practicing violin a lot yesterday. Follow us. We'll take you to where Hyun is."

Tommy and Sabrina led the way, with the filming team following behind.

Producer Kim Dahyun seized this moment to ask Tommy and Sabrina a question.

"Tommy, Sabrina. Do you think Hyun is always this serious?"

"Rather than being serious, I think he just has a different depth of thought. Sometimes, it feels like talking to a grandfather. But he's not always that serious. When he's playing the violin, he becomes a completely different person."

"A different person?"

Sabrina's silver hair swayed as she answered, looking at Producer Kim Dahyun with her turquoise eyes.

"He looks like a man in love with the violin. Especially when he's writing sheet music after a performance, he wouldn't even notice if thunder struck next to him. He's probably practicing in the rehearsal room right now."

"All night?"

"Sometimes. When he gets an idea or wants to play, he stays in the rehearsal room all day. At first, Tommy and I were worried, but we understood once we realized it was his habit."

Tommy and Sabrina soon arrived at the building where the practice rooms were located.

They walked familiarly to the room where Hyun would be practicing. However, when they opened the door, Hyun was not there.

"He's playing over there."

At Sabrina's voice, Producer Kim Dahyun turned his gaze.

Hyun was holding his violin like a doll, using the sheet music as a blanket, leaning against one side of the practice room with his eyes closed.

You could even hear his gentle snoring, indicating he was in a deep sleep. 

Producer Kim Dahyun looked at the number of sheet music scattered on the floor and clicked his tongue.

"Are these sheet music...?"

"Probably the result of him thinking all night. We are always surprised that Hyun can write so much sheet music overnight. There are probably very few people in the world who get so many musical ideas."

Producer Kim Dahyun calmed his astonishment and signaled the filming director. The filming director zoomed in on the sleeping Hyun, who was embracing the violin and using the sheet music as a blanket.

The scene of him sleeping, hugging the violin, looked as mysteriously beautiful as a piece of art.
