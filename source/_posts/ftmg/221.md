"Where should I look?"

Professor Bianca's voice was unusually shaky.

"Please look at the camera, Professor. We will shoot as if we're having a casual conversation. I will ask questions randomly from the questionnaire you prepared earlier, so feel free to answer as you thought. If you get too nervous, your beautiful face might not come out well. Just think of me as a student from the high school broadcasting club on a field trip."

PD Kim Dahyun skillfully helped Professor Bianca relax.

It's natural for nine out of ten ordinary people to freeze up when faced with a broadcast camera.

After all, the thought of many people seeing your face can be nerve-wracking. However...

"It feels different from performing on stage. Fortunately, I'm gradually getting used to it. At first, the lit-up camera felt like Medusa's head."

Professor Bianca melted away her tension with her experience and age. Before long, her eyes became sharp as if she were dealing with her students.

"Here is the first question. You are the head of the violin department. What were your first impressions when you first encountered Hyun? Given that you're already quite well-known in the media, you must have had high expectations."

"It would be a lie to say I didn't have any expectations. He was not only loved by the conductor known as the heart of London but also received abundant love from the legendary maestro Karas. There were even rumors that Mozart had reincarnated, weren't there?"

The greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment.

However...

"Hyun exceeded all of our excessive expectations. Especially, I confirmed his skills with my own eyes at the concert. There are countless geniuses in the world. Most of them are self-centered and selfish. At least, those I have seen in the music world were so. But Hyun was different. Especially, his improvement of Tommy, a cello major, in a short period was unbelievable. That was not the behavior of an arrogant young genius. If I had to describe it in one sentence."

Professor Bianca nodded briefly and added.

"A master."

The image of the trio was still vivid in Professor Bianca's mind.

Of course, the performances of Kang Hyun and Sabrina were outstanding, to say the least.

But the one who most caught Professor Bianca's eye was undoubtedly Tommy, who played the cello.

Professor Bianca could hardly believe with her own eyes that Tommy's musical style could change so much in such a short time.

No professor at the Royal Academy of Music could arguably offer such magical teaching.

"You might think my words are exaggerated. Judging by your face, PD-nim, you seem to think I'm praising Hyun too much."

"Did it show a bit? Actually, I'm a fan of Kang Hyun, but hearing such high praise from you is quite overwhelming. I heard from students that you are very strict."

"It is true that I am strict with students when it comes to music. Also, whether my words are exaggerated or not, you'll be able to see with your own eyes today, PD-nim."

PD Kim Dahyun looked puzzled as Professor Bianca spoke.

"Today, Hyun has been given a very interesting task."

* * *

"Teaching students?"

Tommy nodded briefly in response to Kang Hyun's question.

"Originally, only exceptionally outstanding seniors did it, but this time the professors pointed at you and me. We are supposed to guide students under fifteen who aspire to go to the Royal Academy of Music in their respective majors. I am also quite taken aback."

Tommy's face was filled with tension, evident from his trembling freckles. In contrast, Kang Hyun seemed completely unbothered.

It was natural. Compared to Tommy, Kang Hyun had much more experience teaching music to others.

"All you have to do is give personal guidance on the piece the student wants. Especially, the students on your side have been informed about today's filming and have given their consent, so you don't have to worry."

Professor Albert turned his back without further explanation.

Kang Hyun and Tommy each opened the door to the practice rooms where their students were waiting. The practice room was much more spacious than usual, and students who looked much younger than Sabrina were waiting.

When Kang Hyun and the filming director entered, the children's faces tensed up.

"This is Hyun, and I'll be guiding you all today. Don't be too nervous. The more nervous you are, the slower your fingers will move."

When Kang Hyun spoke with a smile, the girls blushed and nodded vigorously.

The boys were no different. Kang Hyun looked at the five young students, pondering how to guide them.

"Shall we start by having each of you play the piece you want?"

At Kang Hyun's gentle instruction, a girl stood up.

"Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4, first movement, very good."

Kang Hyun smiled with satisfaction as he received the sheet music from the girl.

The girl, despite her nervousness, stood up and positioned the violin on her shoulder.

Could it be that she was a violinist despite her young age? As soon as she lifted the bow, her eyes changed.

Zing.

To the filming director, who was unfamiliar with classical music, it sounded like a lively, cheerful melody.

Moreover, the flashy movements of the bow and the dazzling fingers moving between the strings clearly showed how much the young girl had practiced.

But how much time had passed? Kang Hyun suddenly raised his hand.

"Okay, up to there."

Kang Hyun got up from his seat and approached the girl. After carefully examining her fingers and the violin bow, he sat back down and said.

"You have a bad habit."

What bad habit was he referring to?

"You trust the sheet music too literally."

* * *

The more PD Kim Dahyun checked the footage, the more Professor Bianca's words came to mind.

Hyun certainly made the younger students feel comfortable and relaxed, but when it came to music, he was different.

Gulp.

PD Kim Dahyun's hands were sweating as he watched the footage, seeing just how sharp Hyun's eyes were.

His teaching method was vastly different from that of Tommy, who played the cello. Hyun, as if he had given countless lessons, immediately pointed out the students' problems.

"Again."

The girl's face quickly turned into a frown. She thought she had played diligently, but Hyun firmly shook his head.

"Again."

Under repeated corrections, the girl's face turned red with frustration. It was understandable since Hyun made her play again without explaining what was wrong.

But the girl silently endured the frustration and played the violin again.

"Could you give me the violin for a moment?"

Eventually, Hyun took the violin. The girl's face was a mix of frustration and excitement. Let's see how well he does. She must be thinking this.

Hyun played the exact same Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4 that the girl had just played.

Matching the bowing and the subtle relaxation of the fingers as if mimicking the girl.

"This was your performance just a moment ago."

And,

"This is my performance now."

As soon as he finished speaking, the strings and the bow produced a completely different melody. It sounded like a totally different piece of music, with a different tone.

The fingers moved freely between the strings as if there were no space between them.

"Your bowing is not yet familiar, and your fingers are too short. As a result, your fingering and precise harmonics are lacking. But the most fundamental issue is that you misunderstand the piece. If you blindly follow the indications in the sheet music, you might think you are playing diligently, but the audience will find it dull. The most important thing is the expressiveness of the piece."

The tone of the piece kept changing. It was hard to believe it was the same Mozart piece the girl had just played.

Hyun continued to give detailed guidance to the girl.

Although the short lesson was originally planned to last three hours, Hyun spent the entire day guiding all five young students without skipping anyone.

After the long, uninterrupted guidance session ended, the filming director quietly asked Hyun.

Why did you put so much effort into guiding young students? After all, the cello part's guidance session in the neighboring practice room ended hours ago.

Hyun answered simply.

"Potential."

Looking at the filming camera, Hyun elaborated.

"I don't know how many of them will continue with music in the future. Some might give up midway. But if today I can ignite the potential in even one of them, it was not a wasted time at all. Rather, it was an honor. To meet young violinists who might become future masters."

"Tommy, did you put something in your hair?"

Tommy's hair was neatly combed, unlike usual. It seemed he had used pomade.

Tommy, feeling shy, rubbed his nose and answered Sabrina, "It's for the broadcast."

Soon, the filming team approached Tommy and Sabrina.

"Tommy, do you know where Hyun is?"

"He's not in the dorm?"

"No, we looked for him early this morning, but he wasn't there."

At that moment, Sabrina nudged Tommy's side.

"Tommy, Hyun is probably there."

"Oh, right! He was practicing the violin last night too. Follow us. We'll take you to where Hyun is."

With Tommy and Sabrina leading the way, the filming team followed.

PD Kim Dahyun seized the moment and asked Tommy and Sabrina, who were closest to Hyun at the Royal Academy of Music, some questions.

"Tommy, Sabrina, do you think Hyun is always that serious?"

"Rather than serious, I think he just has a different depth of thought. Sometimes, it feels like talking to a grandfather. But he's not always that serious. When he plays the violin, he becomes a completely different person."

"A different person?"

Sabrina's silver hair swayed as she answered, looking at PD Kim Dahyun with her turquoise eyes.

"It's like he's a man in love with the violin. Especially when he's finished playing and starts writing music, he wouldn't even notice if thunder struck next to him. He's probably practicing in the practice room right now."

"All night long?"

"He often did. When he had a musical idea or wanted to play, he wouldn't leave the practice room all day. At first, Tommy and I were worried, but we understood once we knew it was his habit."

Finally, Tommy and Sabrina arrived at the building where the practice room was located.

The two walked familiar steps toward the practice room where Hyun would be playing. However, upon opening the practice room door, Hyun was nowhere to be found.

"He's playing over there."

At Sabrina's voice, PD Kim Dahyun's gaze turned.

Hyun was sleeping, hugging his violin like a doll and using sheet music as a blanket, leaning against one side of the practice room.

The sound of his light breathing indicated he was in a deep sleep. PD Kim Dahyun was astonished by the number of sheet music scattered on the floor.

"Are these sheet music...?"

"They're probably the result of his all-night inspiration. We are always amazed too. The fact that Hyun can write so much music in one night. There are probably very few people in the world who get so much musical inspiration."

PD Kim Dahyun, calming his surprise, signaled to the filming director. The filming director zoomed in on the sleeping Hyun with the camera.

The sight of him sleeping, hugging his violin, and using sheet music as a blanket was mysteriously beautiful, like a scene from a photo shoot.

PD Kim Dahyun sensed that this scene would be remembered forever in the history of K Broadcasting Station.
