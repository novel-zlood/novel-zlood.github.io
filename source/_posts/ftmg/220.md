Violation of School Rules―!

The dormitory building resonated with a booming voice. Tommy's face turned pale in an instant.

The reason was simple. The source of the voice was unmistakably the dormitory supervisor, Mr. Douglas.

"Hyun!"

Tommy hurriedly grabbed Kang Hyun's shoulder, who was lying on the bed, and shook him.

Though he was curious about the girl sleeping soundly on Kang Hyun's chest, there was no time to ask.

Kang Hyun opened his eyes groggily as his shoulder shook as if there was an earthquake.

"Tommy...?"

Kang Hyun looked at Tommy's freckled face in confusion and suddenly felt a warmth on his chest.

As Kang Hyun's gaze slowly lowered, he locked eyes with Son Yooha, who had just woken up.

Gasp.

Both of them simultaneously held their breath.

Kang Hyun had planned to spend the night with Yooha, who had nowhere else to go, and send her back to the US on a morning flight. But things had turned out like this.

At that moment,

"Hyun, there's a big problem!"

"What do you mean, a big problem?"

"The supervisor is doing a surprise inspection right now!"

A surprise inspection? Before Kang Hyun could ask further, Tommy urgently pressed them.

When Kang Hyun asked for details, Tommy explained in a hurry that it was the monthly dormitory surprise inspection.

Only then did Kang Hyun hastily start tidying up the room.

Violation of School Rules―!

Mr. Douglas's booming voice echoed through the dormitory building again.

It seemed someone had been caught hiding vodka in another dorm room. Tommy, pale-faced, spoke to Kang Hyun.

"Hyun, I'll go out first! Do something about that friend quickly!"

Tommy left the room, leaving Kang Hyun and Son Yooha behind. Yooha seemed at a loss. Kang Hyun eventually put shoes and a coat on her and opened the wardrobe.

"Yooha, hide here for a bit."

"Okay!"

For some reason, Son Yooha's face seemed excited. He wanted to tell her to escape through the window, but they were on a high floor, so it wasn't an option.

After some time, heavy footsteps approached Kang Hyun's room, and the supervisor arrived.

"I'll conduct a surprise inspection."

The supervisor was imposing, as if he had been the captain of a rugby team rather than a music teacher. He inspected the room with sharp eyes, resembling an FBI agent.

"What's this?"

The supervisor picked up a long strand of hair from the bed with his thick fingers.

Kang Hyun's throat tightened. He had never been this nervous, not even during an inspection at the Western District Prosecutor's Office.

"Hmm. I won't make a fuss about a girl staying here briefly."

The supervisor seemed more flexible than expected. It was understandable since a place with energetic students would often have female visitors, even in a boys' dormitory. Just then, the supervisor walked toward the wardrobe.

"But what's this?"

Oh no, a red scarf belonging to Son Yooha was sticking out of the wardrobe door.

"Hyun, you don't seem to be very organized."

No!

Kang Hyun wanted to stop the supervisor immediately, but it was too late. The supervisor opened the wardrobe door wide.

With a clatter, Son Yooha fell out, and she and the supervisor locked eyes. The supervisor's eyes widened momentarily and then narrowed angrily.

"Violation of School Rules―!!"

"There's a Korean proverb that says, 'The quiet cat eats the fish first.' Ha ha ha."

The actual proverb is 'The quiet cat climbs onto the stove first,' but what's the difference? President Samuel's face was filled with a rare smile.

"I never thought Hyun would have a girl with him in the dormitory. I heard she's not even a student from our school?"

"Yes, she's a student studying in New York."

"Whoa, New York?"

President Samuel's eyes widened at Professor Bianca's words. He had thought she was another student from the Royal Music School!

"They're a legendary couple. Imagine coming all the way from the US to meet Hyun."

"President, what should we do?"

"What do you mean, what should we do? We have to understand since they're at a passionate age. Honestly, I was worried that Hyun might not be interested in girls. And I also invited a female friend to my dormitory during my time at the Royal Music School, so it's not a big deal. But rules are rules, so give them the same punishment as other students."

Professor Bianca made an awkward face. It was already well-known among the professors that President Samuel had been quite the troublemaker during his time at the Royal Music School.

"By the way, there was a contact from a TV program in Korea?"

"Yes, they want to film Hyun's daily life. His agency has already agreed, and we're just waiting for the final decision from our side."

"Hyun is already a renowned musician in Korea and globally, so it's natural they're interested in his campus life. Very well. I need to fix my hair since it'll be aired on Korean TV. Ha ha ha."

As President Samuel looked in the mirror, Professor Bianca also adjusted her attire unconsciously.

Thump, thump, thump.

PD Kim Dahyun from K Broadcasting couldn't contain her excitement. She was about to meet the person she had always wanted to film.

After meeting with Kang Hyun's agency and finally getting permission to film at the Royal Music School, she had hugged her director in joy.

"Senior, you seem really happy?"

"Of course, I'm a huge fan of Hyun!"

"You seem happier than on your wedding day?"

Despite the assistant director's question, PD Kim Dahyun couldn't stop smiling. She was an ardent fan of Kang Hyun.

She had even held an executive position in the fan club formed since his appearance at the Queen Elizabeth competition.

"The ratings will be amazing, right?"

"Who cares about ratings? We're going to meet Hyun!"

The assistant director shook his head. It was surprising that Kim Dahyun, who should be enjoying her newlywed life, had decided on a month-long overseas trip for Kang Hyun.

"Isn't your husband jealous?"

"Hey, PD Song is also a huge fan of Hyun. He begged me to get an autographed CD for him!"

It made sense why two seemingly mismatched people had gotten married. They had a strong common interest.

As the view of London unfolded outside the plane window, PD Kim Dahyun's smile widened even more.

"This shoot is going to be amazing."

She had tried countless times to film Kang Hyun, contacting his agency, Jeil Gallery, constantly.

After years of persistence, she finally succeeded in arranging the shoot.

Since his appearance at the Queen Elizabeth competition, Kang Hyun had rarely appeared in the media. But each appearance had been a sensational event.

Especially the video of him conducting an orchestra for the British royal family at the age of seventeen was still talked about by classical music fans worldwide.

"Leaf sweeping..."

As autumn was ending, Kang Hyun used a blower to gather the leaves scattered in the Royal Music School's garden. On the bright side, it wasn't bathroom cleaning.

Kang Hyun gave a wry smile while sweeping the leaves. He never imagined he would be punished for letting a girl into the dormitory.

"There are still a lot of leaves left―!"

The supervisor kept a vigilant eye on Kang Hyun, ensuring he wasn't slacking off.

The Royal Music School's spacious garden was being cleaned by other students as well, most having violated school rules.

Some, like Kang Hyun, had spent the night with their girlfriends.

"Spending an entire day cleaning the school, unbelievable."

Even though he was busy transcribing his musical ideas, he couldn't avoid this. After hours of gathering leaves, they finally got a short break.

"Hyun!"

As if waiting for this moment, Tommy and Sabrina approached together.

The two had become inseparable, holding hands without embarrassment. Sabrina seemed to lead Tommy, almost reversing traditional gender roles.

"Who was that girl we saw this morning?"

"Tommy says she's your girlfriend, is that true?"

"Why didn't you introduce her to us?"

Questions poured out like machine gun fire from Sabrina and Tommy.

"Where is your girlfriend now?"

"She flew back to New York early this morning."

"Oh my gosh, coming all the way from the US just to see you! That's so romantic!"

Sabrina exclaimed, her silver hair shimmering. Other students nearby perked up their ears to listen to their conversation.

After all, since Kang Hyun transferred as an exchange student, he had garnered a lot of interest from female students.

Many would be disappointed to learn Kang Hyun had a girlfriend.

"Hyun, is it true a filming crew from Korea is coming to shoot you?"

"I got a call from my agency about it a few days ago."

"Wow, you really are a star. When does the filming start?"

"I heard they start shooting today..."

At that moment, a group carrying cameras approached Kang Hyun from across the garden. It seemed inevitable.

"Hello, Kang Hyun!"

PD Kim Dahyun greeted Kang Hyun energetically.

Sabrina, Tommy, and even the supervisor watched the filming crew curiously.

After greeting Kang Hyun, PD Kim Dahyun skillfully conversed in English with the supervisor.

"You want to start filming now?"

"Yes, the purpose of the program is to show Kang Hyun's daily life without exaggeration. We've already received permission from the school."

Of all days. Kang Hyun clicked his tongue inwardly. Why did they have to come on the day he was being punished?

Just then, the break ended, and it was time to resume cleaning the garden.

Mr. Douglas's face showed deep contemplation. He was unsure whether to make Kang Hyun clean while being filmed.

Then Kang Hyun decisively walked over to resume his cleaning.

"Kang Hyun, what are you doing now?"

PD Kim Dahyun asked in English, not Korean. She seemed puzzled by the students cleaning the garden.

Sabrina tried to answer instead.

"Hyun let a girl stay in the dorm..."

Tommy hurriedly covered Sabrina's mouth. Kang Hyun, sweating nervously, answered.

"Community service."
