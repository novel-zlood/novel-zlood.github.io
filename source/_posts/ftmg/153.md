"Mr. Spencer won't be able to come out?"

The teacup was placed down with a sound. The reception room was filled with a rich and smooth aroma, just like the name of the tea, Rose Queen.

Queen Elizabeth II of England's face was full of questions.

The queen not only used social gatherings as a means of interaction but also genuinely enjoyed classical music. She especially loved the performances of the London Symphony, and the reason was Maestro Spencer.

The queen herself was an ardent fan of his.

"I understand his shoulder is in very poor condition. His doctor said it’s serious enough that he needs immediate surgery. Considering he has been conducting for decades, it’s no surprise."

"Oh dear, make sure the Crown Prince pays special attention. Mr. Spencer is not only a close friend of the Crown Prince but also a treasure of London."

Samuel knew why his mother held Spencer in such high regard.

When his elder brother, who originally had the right to the throne, gave up his position as Crown Prince due to a scandal, his mother had been very distressed. The only thing that comforted her weary heart was the performances of the London Symphony.

"Crown Prince, what will happen to the upcoming royal performance then?"

"We plan to proceed with the London Symphony as originally planned."

"And the conductor?"

The queen's brow furrowed. She knew that the members of the London Symphony were excellent musicians, but the conductor's position was vacant. It was like a red bean bun without the red bean filling.

"Currently, Maestro Spencer is personally selecting conductors. He's choosing from new conductors from Asia, America, and Europe."

"New conductors?"

"Yes, in celebration of the upcoming millennium, the maestro is looking for a new face for the London Symphony. The results should be out by now."

The queen licked her dry lips regretfully. But there was nothing she could do.

Time waits for no one. Just as she would have to step down from the throne someday, Spencer would also have to put down his baton eventually.

As much as she wanted to ask him to conduct the royal performance, she couldn't. Asking him to continue conducting with an injured shoulder would be disrespectful to the maestro.

"Crown Prince, is there a new conductor you have in mind?"

To the queen's question,

"Yes, there is one."

Samuel answered without hesitation.

The first meeting was with a young boy from the East, but the second meeting was with Hyun, a violinist.

Samuel sipped his tea pleasantly, hoping that the third meeting would be with a world-renowned young maestro.

"Changing the symphony?"

"Hyun, I'm thinking of using your piece."

"What?"

Kang Hyun's face showed signs of confusion. He wasn't this surprised even when he was called after the final audition.

The maestro's face remained calm, as if to ask why Hyun was so surprised.

"Maestro, it's a piece that hasn't even premiered yet."

"I know."

"Premiering an untested symphony at the royal performance?"

For composers, a premiere held significant meaning. Moreover, it was the first symphony Kang Hyun had ever composed.

No one knew what kind of melodies would actually resonate. Rather than lacking confidence, he was worried it might be a nuisance.

But the maestro had a completely different perspective.

"Hyun, are you not confident?"

"No, that's not it."

"Then it's settled. The thought occurred to me as soon as I received your score: why not perform this symphony at the upcoming royal celebration? I've already discussed it with the concertmaster. In fact, Dmitri was even more excited than I was. He was the first to check your symphony, so it's no wonder."

The maestro spoke as if it were a given. Dmitri's words about being shocked as soon as he received the score were no lie.

The maestro himself was also astonished by Kang Hyun's score. After the astonishment came a deep excitement. It must have been the same feeling that the greats of the past had when they first saw Beethoven's scores.

"After watching the final audition, I was convinced it was you. The performances of the two people before you also clearly showcased their abilities as conductors, but as someone said, the opponent wasn't good."

Miles from America and Matthew from Europe showed such sophisticated conducting that it was hard to believe they were new conductors.

Their continuous excellent conducting was enough to make the British musicians in the concert hall nod in approval.

But Kang Hyun, the last participant, was on a different level.

From his first appearance, he captured the audience's attention, and as soon as his baton made of olive wood sliced through the air, the London Symphony produced a unique melody.

"Not just anyone can conduct like that in front of a large audience. Especially the effect of the fifth movement of the strings, which intensified as the movements progressed, made it sound like a completely different piece from the previous symphonies. The standing ovation from the audience after all the movements ended was a pure expression of respect for you by the musicians."

It was a spectacular scene. As the baton went down and the symphony ended, the British musicians who filled the concert hall stood up one by one, clapping their hands.

Their faces were filled with excitement and anticipation.

The notion that an orchestra should be calm and quiet is a misconception. It was only natural to greet those who had displayed heart-touching melodies with enthusiastic and passionate applause.

Kang Hyun looked at the maestro as if he had no choice.

"Maestro, with all due respect, did you get approval from the royal family?"

"Usually, the symphony performed at the royal performance is chosen by me first. Of course, it requires direct approval from the royal family, but that's something I can personally explain to them. Hyun, do you know what this royal performance signifies?"

"Yes, I do."

There's a saying that the British queen has two birthdays. One is her actual birthday, and the other is the official birthday celebrated in the second week of June.

Historically, King George II of England had his birthday in November, but the weather was too cold for a party, so it was moved to June. That tradition has remained intact.

Coincidentally, the royal successor, like King George II, was born in November, and the banquet was created to celebrate this.

"It will be a celebration that all of Britain will cheer for. It’s no exaggeration to say the whole of Britain will be excited. And you will be at the forefront of this celebration. It might have been destined from the moment you composed that symphony."

The maestro gave a faint smile. Despite the heavy burden on his shoulders, there was no sign of tension on Kang Hyun's face.

The premieres of transcendent masterpieces are always etched into history.

Just as it was with Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach, so too will it be with Kang Hyun's symphony.

"Isn't the time difference with England 8 hours?"

Late evening, the house in Ichon-dong was packed with people.

Along with his grandfather, there were Chairman Wang, Kang Hyun's parents, President Son Ilseon, Director Im Hyera, and even Dr. Tikhonov.

The reason they had all gathered was simple.

"Old man, I never thought I'd see a royal performance on terrestrial TV in my lifetime. I didn't know the royal annex looked like that. It's as good as any concert hall."

"I wouldn't have guessed either. I still can’t tell if this is a dream."

"Come to think of it, Hyun is really something. Just now, on my way to Ichon-dong, I didn’t see a single car on the road."

It was probably because Kang Hyun was conducting the royal performance in England.

A month ago, when the London Symphony announced this, the South Korean media was all abuzz.

The significance of conducting a royal performance in the classical music world was immense. It was hard to believe that a 17-year-old young maestro was given such an honor.

It was so unprecedented that the national broadcaster signed a contract with the BBC to broadcast the royal performance live.

As the time for the live broadcast of the Royal Performance approached, Seoul, and even the entire country, became quiet, reminiscent of the final episode of the popular drama "Sandglass."

"Dear, I heard that Hyun's conducting this time is a big deal?"

"Yes, Father. It's a huge deal. The record company is already talking about needing to produce more initial copies of Hyun's solo album. Reporters from the music press are saying that conducting a royal performance is like winning an Olympic gold medal. You wouldn't believe how many calls we've received over the past month."

Chairman Wang smiled with satisfaction and turned to shake hands with Chairman Yoo.

"In-law, no matter how you look at it, our grandson-in-law is quite exceptional. By now, your granddaughter-in-law must be watching the broadcast from America."

The grandfathers were now so accustomed to calling each other in-laws. At that moment.

"Look, there's our grandson-in-law!"

Chairman Wang raised his voice cheerfully and pointed at the TV. On the screen, Kang Hyun appeared in a tailcoat.

Everyone clenched their hands in tension. But at the same time, there was a strange sense of anticipation and excitement.

It was inevitable upon seeing Kang Hyun. Despite the numerous cameras filming him, his eyes did not waver, and his stride was filled with elegance. He was a maestro through and through.

* * *

-Hyun, now it's your time.

Kang Hyun suddenly recalled Spencer's advice to him. It was a short phrase expressing the weight of responsibility as a conductor who had to lead many members.

The royal annex of the British royal family was decorated like a world-class concert hall. It would be a place to pray for the eternal peace and blessings of the royal family before starting the celebration.

Tap.

As Kang Hyun walked towards the stage, a soft glow of sunlight poured over him. The members stood up with solemn expressions to welcome him.

His tailcoat fluttered as Kang Hyun's gaze turned towards the audience.

Led by the Queen of England, there were familiar faces like Crown Prince Samuel and many other famous British figures.

All of them held significant positions in England. Kang Hyun bowed politely towards the Queen.

After a curious applause for the young maestro, his tailcoat fluttered once more.

'Are you ready?'

Kang Hyun had become adept enough to communicate with the members with just a glance without saying a word.

They had spent a month together, rehearsing the symphony countless times.

But because it was a large-scale composition, it would be a burdensome first conduct. It even included a mixed 4-part choir, which was a composition that only someone with considerable conducting experience could handle.

However, Kang Hyun was different. You think he might have been a little nervous? Not at all. Look at those piercing eyes. They seemed to burn as if he had been waiting for this day.

Gang Hyun Symphony No.1

At that moment, as the baton’s tip sharply sliced through the air, a majestic hymn began to resonate.

The harmony of the horns and the tremolo of the strings heralded the beginning of the piece.

The melody gradually rose, expressing the sound of a small heartbeat.

Kang Hyun's eyes scanned the members one by one, and the baton cut through the melody as if stirring the depths.

The audience's faces were turning red with excitement, like the intense beat of the percussion.

Thump thump thump―!

It felt like someone was grabbing their hearts and shaking them.

The conductor's shoulders moved, and from his elbows to his fingertips, every time the massive orchestra played, the audience felt a burning thirst.

It was a piece that did not follow the traditional form of a symphony.

The grandly rising melody melted away like snow and, with the signal of the powerful percussion, quickly transitioned to a rapid minor key. Both the audience and the members were breaking into a sweat on their foreheads.

As the movements progressed and the audience's hearts were continuously pounded, it happened.

When Kang Hyun's left hand drew a straight line in the air and clenched his fist at the end, the orchestra instantly slowed down.

At that moment, when everyone was bewildered, the magnificent cry of the choir echoed.

To reach the sun, to reach the sun, like a rising illusion―!

A majestic song began from Kang Hyun's fingertips. It was a clear and grand high note, with no noise mixed in.

The audience collectively held their breath, captivated by the sight and sound. Numerous cameras were capturing this grand scene without missing a single moment.

Celebrating the birth of a new conductor.
