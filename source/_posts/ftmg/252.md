"The wind in Chappelle is always refreshing."

It was Chappelle, located on the outskirts of Brussels. This was the place where twelve carefully selected violinists from the Queen Elisabeth Competition would stay for eight days. For violinists, it was even called a sanctuary.

There stood Hirose, a white-haired violinist.

"There is a lot of talk because I recommended Hyun."

Deng Lun, a maestro from China, cautiously approached Hirose. Currently, there was a lot of talk among the Queen Elisabeth Competition organizers.

The reason was simple. It was because Hirose, the maestro from Japan, had recommended Kang Hyun as the last judge.

"It was expected. Hyun is still young. I don't think their opposition is unreasonable. But if they meet Hyun, the result will be different."

Deng Lun nodded briefly at Hirose's words. Objectively, Kang Hyun's career was impressive. However, compared to other maestros, it couldn't be said that he was on the same level.

But Deng Lun agreed with the statement, "If they meet Hyun, the result will be different."

"That's right, Hirose. That kid is truly mysterious. When I first met him in Brussels seven years ago, I almost thought that the god of music in Brussels had incarnated as a human. It was hard to believe the talent that the kid showed back then. Even the stubborn Alexei had to step back."

"Victor will be the same as Alexei."

Victor was strongly opposed to having Kang Hyun as a judge. But he would also change his mind once he met Hyun.

"Hirose, can I ask why you want to have that kid as a judge?"

"Hyun is someone difficult to evaluate by our standards. Just because he is young doesn't mean we should deny him such a valuable experience. In a way, I think this Queen Elisabeth Competition will be a great experience for Hyun. And, it wasn't me who called him."

"What do you mean?"

"At first, I didn't have Hyun in mind. But while staying in Chappelle, I realized. It is essential to have Hyun to meet the future violinists who will shine in classical history. Once again, it wasn't me who called Hyun."

At that moment, Hirose's white hair fluttered in the wind.

"It was the god of music in Chappelle that called him."

Sizzleâ€•!

The house in Ichon-dong was filled with a savory smell. The table was laid out with a feast that included japchae with a mother's touch, galbijjim, lotus root stew, and stir-fried anchovies, all of Hyun's favorites. It looked so grand that one might mistake it for a banquet.

[Violinist Kang Hyun has received the 2001 Popular Culture and Arts Award. At the age of 13, Kang Hyun won the Queen Elisabeth Competition and made his mark in the music world. He was the first Asian to conduct a performance for the British Royal Family and has received numerous offers from prestigious orchestras worldwide. Additionally, he made a historic mark in classical music by ranking on the Billboard charts, which was considered impregnable.]

The news was full of stories about Kang Hyun. Since his performance in New York, the media had been comparing him to Mozart, praising him as an Asian musical genius.

There was public opinion that he should be given various benefits, including military exemption, for his contributions to promoting the nation and making the name of South Korea known worldwide.

In reality, apart from the military exemption benefit he received for winning the Queen Elisabeth Competition, various commendations were pouring in.

"Father, I'm here."

At that moment, Hyun's aunt and uncle entered the house in Ichon-dong. Unlike the still exiled and unforgiven uncles, they were the only relatives who could still face the grandfather.

Grandfather nodded slightly in acknowledgment of their greetings and walked to the dining table.

"Hyunja, when is Hyun coming?"

"He'll be here soon. Today, he said he would come straight to Ichon-dong after finishing an interview since so many reporters contacted him. Sister and brother-in-law, come and sit down. Jinsuk, you too, wash your hands and come sit."

"I wish Kang would come quickly too. He's stuck with company work."

Dongju had already secured his entry into China.

The help from Geumwang Group and Dengzheng was significant. Not only the existing chemical materials, which were the cash cow, but also graphene had given him wings.

Moreover, entering China. Thanks to this, Dongju was receiving evaluations of having reached a second peak in the chemical industry. At that moment,

"I'm back."

When Kang Hyun's voice was heard, smiles spread across his grandfather's and mother's faces. Kang Hyun, who had postponed his life in England to work in Korea.

He intended to spend his sabbatical year in Korea, but he was as hard to see as when he was abroad.

"Aunt and uncle are here too. Jinsuk hyung is here as well. Is today a special day?"

"You brat, everyone gathered to congratulate you on receiving the commendation."

Grandfather patted Hyun's head and sat at the table together. The atmosphere at the meal was harmonious. Of course, the aunt and uncle were eating quietly, unlike before.

They had already committed too many mistakes to speak up. At that moment,

"Jinsuk hyung, don't you have to go to the army soon?"

"What?"

At Hyun's words, Yoo Jinsuk stiffened as if he had indigestion.

Yoo Jinsuk had gone to college abroad. It was more like an escape than studying. In the end, he couldn't adapt to school life, took a leave of absence, and hadn't returned to Korea.

"Hyun, Jinsuk is planning to take the medical exam abroad and then get a medical license in Korea and go to the army as a military doctor."

"A military doctor?"

Hyun swallowed a bitter smile. Because in his past life, Yoo Jinsuk had dropped out of an unnamed medical school abroad where he had been admitted through donations. Far from being a military doctor, he remembered Jinsuk had gone to public service through a broker.

Afterward, he was sued for fraud and met as a suspect and prosecutor in the Western District Prosecutor's Office. At that moment,

"Instead of that, since you're taking a break from school, why don't you go to the army now?"

"Father?"

"Jinsuk, stop avoiding it and go like a man."

Yoo Jinsuk swallowed nervously. He hadn't expected that the topic of the army would come up today.

Hyun thought it was rather fortunate. If Jinsuk went to the army, there might be a slight chance that he would come to his senses. The uncles and aunt were already enough troublemakers in this family.

"Father, Jinsuk is planning to go as a military doctor. How can he go as an ordinary soldier? Our child can't manage in such a rough place."

"Bokja, how long are you going to keep him wrapped up in your skirt?"

At the grandfather's stern voice, the aunt closed her mouth.

Yoo Jinsuk wanted to curse Hyun for creating this situation, but he couldn't. Whenever he met Hyun's eyes, he felt utterly intimidated, like a herbivore in front of a predator.

At that moment,

"Jinsuk hyung, are you not interested in the marines?"

Yoo Jinsuk's face turned pale.

* * *

"Will he become a proper person...?"

A week had passed since Hyun mentioned the "marines" to Yoo Jinsuk. The grandfather had pushed so strongly that there were already rumors that Jinsuk had applied to the marines.

Hyun felt sorry for Jinsuk, but there was no choice. He felt that if things continued as they were, he would see Jinsuk sued for fraud just like in his past life.

"If he rolls around in the marines, he might become a proper person."

At least he wouldn't have to see that bright yellow hair anymore. Somehow, it was even more bleached than the blonde he had seen in New York. If he wore luxury brands, he would be the perfect example of an "orange tribe."

"Hyun."

"Director?"

At that moment, Director Im Hyera came to Hyun's studio. Her face was unexpectedly flushed. Could it be another commendation or a CF offer from a major overseas company?

"Don't be surprised."

"What is it that's making you so suspenseful?"

Hyun knew Director Im Hyera's personality. She wouldn't make such a big deal out of an ordinary matter.

It was natural. After all, she was the wife of the chairman of Jeil Group. She was one of the most influential women in Korea.

"You've been invited to be a judge."

"A judge?"

It was an unexpected statement. The only judging he had done so far was for the violin part auditions for the New York Philharmonic. That, too, was because concertmaster Antonio had asked him so earnestly. It was a reluctant choice. Hyun was still too young to be a judge.

"The Queen Elisabeth Competition organizers contacted us. They want to invite you to the judging panel."

"What?"

"The Queen Elisabeth Competition, the one you won seven years ago."

"Wait a minute. Director, did I hear right? The Queen Elisabeth Competition, not some regional contest but the one held in Brussels?"

Hyun couldn't believe it. It was only natural. The Queen Elisabeth Competition was where the world's best musical prodigies gathered to compete.

For violinists, it was even called the stage of dreams. He himself had participated in the Queen Elisabeth Competition seven years ago. At that time, he had participated mainly for the "military exemption" benefit.

"Director, you must have heard it wrong. It's not like I'm performing at the Queen Elisabeth Competition, but judging? The judges there are all maestros whose names are well-known."

Thinking back, there were maestros like Alexei from Russia, Deng Lun from China, and Pierre Ganel from France. Only renowned maestros were judges at the competition.

Even the candidates for the judging panel were filled with well-known maestros.

Objectively speaking, it was unreasonable for Hyun to be invited as a judge.

"I asked several times because I couldn't believe it myself."

"There must be a mistake. Even if I were a candidate, there would have been a lot of opposition. My career aside, I'm too young. Alexei, who was a judge seven years ago, is now the head of the Moscow Conservatory."

"Someone strongly recommended you. They said this person even moved the hearts of the other judges."

Who could it be that moved the hearts of such proud maestros?

Being on the judging panel would mean being on equal footing with the maestros. It was something that couldn't be easily described. It was different from conducting an orchestra as the youngest conductor.

At that moment, Director Im Hyera revealed the person who had moved the hearts of the maestros.

"Professor Hirose strongly recommended you."

The Queen of Strings.
