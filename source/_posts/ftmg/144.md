Principal member Charles, holding his oboe, gives the signal.

The concertmaster stands, staring at them with piercing eyes. Considering the conductor's tendencies, the concertmaster gestures to the members to play a slightly higher pitch than the standard.

Dozens of instruments, initially producing dissonance, gradually start forming a unified ensemble.

The concertmaster not only oversees the technical issues of the string section but also meticulously addresses every minor problem of all the members.

Without a word, the concertmaster reads the movements of the bows in the string section with cold eyes, determining whether to use an up-bow or a down-bow.

In the concert hall, silence is filled only with melodies. Having worked together for a long time, they could read each other's thoughts with just a glance.

The faces of the new members still showed signs of tension. Although it had already been a month since they joined the London Symphony, they seemed more nervous than at their first rehearsal.

The reason was simple. Maestro Spencer was gradually returning to his former self.

Thud.

As Maestro Spencer, known as the heart of the London Symphony, appeared, the members instantly fell silent.

The concertmaster stood up and greeted the maestro politely. Even though there wasn't a single audience member in the seats, the rehearsal was so intense that the faces of the members were filled with determination.

It was no different for the principal members. If they made even a slight mistake, they would receive the maestro's sharp gaze.

It was then.

"Christine."

Before starting the rehearsal, Spencer softly called the name of the new member in charge of the second violin. Although the concertmaster, Dmitri, gave a hint, the person in question seemed oblivious.

The reason Spencer called Christine was simple. The direction of the bow was different. It was a common mistake for new members but an unforgivable one in the London Symphony.

Without hearing an apology, Spencer's gaze swept over everyone.

At that moment, the maestro's left hand scanned the room,

and the baton in his right hand swiftly sliced through the air.

Thud thud thud—!

Tempo, rhythm, and the direction of the melody began to move like magic at the tip of the sharp baton.

Dozens of instruments were releasing melodies in perfect harmony, but Spencer's eyes and ears missed nothing.

Clench.

At that moment, the conductor's left hand sliced through the air and clenched into a fist. The reason was simple. Someone had made a mistake.

"Violin—!"

Specifically, it was Christine's mistake in the second violin part. Spencer knew this but still shouted at the violin section.

In the continuous tense rehearsals, even the foreheads of the principal members began to bead with sweat, not just the new members.

As Spencer walked off the stage at the end of a rehearsal that seemed endless, Emmanuel let out a breath he had been holding.

"Dmitri, don't you think Maestro is gradually returning to his old self?"

"It's too early to say he's back to his old self."

"That's true. In the past, if there was a mistake like just now, he would have kicked them off the stage without mercy. Still, it feels like he's about thirty percent back to his old self."

The suffocating tension was only at thirty percent?

"Hyun needs to come back soon. Only then will the maestro soften like before—!"

No one could deny those words. After all, since Kang Hyun returned to Korea, the maestro had gradually started to revert to his old self. Emmanuel wiped the sweat from his palms and forehead with a handkerchief.

"I've never seen anyone with eyes that pin people down like the maestro's. He must have been a tiger in his past life. I was so scared I was sweating buckets. Has anyone seen someone with eyes like the maestro's?"

"I have seen someone with eyes similar to the maestro's. It felt similar in a different way."

"Chloe?"

At that moment, Chloe began to speak cautiously, as if recalling the past. Where could she have seen eyes similar to the maestro's?

"In Korea."

"Are you still recording?"

Baek Junghoon clicked his tongue as he entered the studio.

Hadn't it been days without distinguishing between night and day, repeatedly recording? Kang Hyun was so meticulous that even Baek Junghoon, known for his relentless practice, was ready to surrender.

If there were an Olympic event for concentration, he would undoubtedly represent the nation.

"I don't like it."

"You don't like it?"

Baek Junghoon couldn't understand. It was natural. Listening to Kang Hyun's recorded performance, he would often find himself entranced.

Even Baek Junghoon, who had studied music his entire life, was deeply moved by the melody, yet Kang Hyun evaluated it as dissatisfactory.

Gulp.

After listening to the entire recorded performance, Baek Junghoon's Adam's apple bobbed involuntarily.

Even if they released an album with this level of quality, EMA, a renowned classical label, would undoubtedly welcome it with open arms. It was needless to say for those eagerly awaiting Kang Hyun's album since his solo concert.

Nevertheless, Kang Hyun was preparing for another recording.

"I'll do it again."

Baek Junghoon accompanied Kang Hyun's performance. However, Kang Hyun kept stopping the performance.

Knowing Kang Hyun's perfectionist nature, Baek Junghoon nodded and composed himself.

In fact, it seemed like he was the one more excited than Kang Hyun.

"Again."

It wasn't a song boasting flashy techniques or sharp melodies. It was a lyrical piece starting with a warm, slow atmosphere, like the ripples of a calm lake or a child's laughter. Perhaps that made it even harder to express the musical ideas on the score through his fingertips.

Hadn't someone said that slow performances are much more challenging than fast ones?

"Whoo—!"

As the performance ended, Baek Junghoon exhaled the breath he had been holding. His whole body was drenched in sweat, as if he had just run a marathon.

"Hyung, there's still more to do. Are you okay?"

"Of course, I'm fine—!"

It wasn't a lie. How could he miss such an opportunity? Even if he had to pay, he would gladly accompany Kang Hyun's performance.

His fingertips touching the piano keys felt like they were electrified, sending tingles throughout his body.

"A bit faster—!"

Kang Hyun personally guided Baek Junghoon's performance. Naturally, since Kang Hyun composed the score, he could interpret it most perfectly.

Baek Junghoon followed Kang Hyun's instructions without missing a single detail, as if he were learning the piano for the first time.

The more they performed, the more Baek Junghoon couldn't hide his astonishment at Kang Hyun's talent. If he had learned the piano, he would have made a name for himself.

"Hyuna, what are you doing tonight after recording?"

Baek Junghoon asked, hoping to have dinner together, but the answer he received was disappointing.

"I have a family gathering."

* * *

"Everyone, raise your glasses."

Doesn't it seem like Big Uncle is imitating Grandfather?

It was a family gathering with not only uncles and aunts but also aunts and their spouses.

Naturally, Big Uncle was seated at the head of the table, trying hard to set the mood, which felt like a sparrow trying to mimic a stork.

As the meal was getting into full swing, Big Uncle and I made eye contact.

"Hyun, what university do you plan to go to?"

"Pardon?"

"You plan to go to a music college, right?"

Of course, it's embarrassing to say it myself, but many music colleges would want me. I heard that professors from prestigious domestic music colleges had contacted Im Hyera, the director, more than once. But Big Uncle's real intention behind asking was different.

‘A silent pressure to stay out of management.’

He was telling me to focus only on music. Naturally, I didn't want to waste my life caught up in greed and power. I knew life was too short to do anything but the music I loved.

But Big Uncle's pompous expression annoyed me.

"I don't know yet. There's still plenty of time, right? Honestly, I'd like to try applying to the business department at Korea University."

"Oh my, Korea University? Do you think it's next door or something? Even I studied quite a bit in my day, but I couldn't get into Korea University. Hyun, do you even study at your school?"

"Yes."

What's there to say? Thanks to my advanced software, studying was easier than in my past life. I never missed being the top student, which sometimes made my homeroom teacher exhausted just looking at me.

It seemed my aunt didn't expect me to naturally say "yes." She might faint when she sees my college entrance exam scores later. Meanwhile, Big Uncle cleared his throat, showing discomfort.

Anyway.

‘Tsk.’

Why did these scheming people come to Ichon-dong together?

After the meal, the younger children left the table first.

"Jinseok, since you're the eldest, take your younger siblings upstairs and play. The adults have things to discuss."

Yoo Jinseok led the cousins upstairs.

When the adults were out of sight, I quietly approached Yoo Jinseok. Seeing my gaze, Yoo Jinseok's face showed clear signs of tension.

It seemed he needed to take some medicine. How could he be so weak?

"Jinseok hyung."

"Y-yeah?"

"Can we talk?"

It's time to check the black box.

* * *

"Tell me more."

I was listening to Yoo Jinseok talk about the incidents at his mother's place when there was a loud commotion downstairs.

As I stood up and moved, Yoo Jinseok followed cautiously, looking scared.

"Anyway, Father won't wake up again, so why are you making a fuss, Kang?"

"Brother, there's a line you shouldn't cross. Father is still alive and well, yet you're already talking about handing over the chairman's position!"

"Kang, aren't you pushing this for your own position? I heard the new material commercialization project is already stagnant. Even if you resist, it's a fact that I'll be the chairman. How dare someone who used to run a laundry come to Dongju and cause a ruckus!"

Big Uncle and Father were glaring at each other, seemingly ready to fight.

I hadn't seen Father like this since he grabbed Little Uncle's collar.

‘Tsk.’

Of course, these scheming siblings didn't come to Ichon-dong for nothing.

Especially Big Uncle, who was probably planning to hold an interim shareholders' meeting to take over Dongju. He intended to seize control of Dongju in Grandfather's absence.

"Hyunja, can't you calm your husband down? He’s so ignorant. Big Brother organized this family gathering to get along, but if he keeps opposing, what can we do? After all, if Father isn't here, Big Brother will be the family elder!"

My aunt openly criticized my father. Meanwhile, Little Uncle remained silent, likely more focused on his upcoming meeting with the VH Company representative than the current situation.

‘Bravo.’

What a spectacle. It was like a drama about a dysfunctional family.

Of course, I'd seen such scenes often in my past life. The more affluent the family, the more intense the management disputes. After all, there was a reason for the historical royal struggles for power.

But still.

‘A pearl necklace on a pig's neck.’

I couldn't bear to see Big Uncle sit in the chairman's seat of Dongju Chemical. Yet, Big Uncle was already acting arrogantly as if he had already taken the position.

He glared at my father as if he wanted to kill him before taking his seat.

"It's been over two weeks since Father has been unconscious. Didn't the attending doctor say they don't know why? A doctor I know said that even if he wakes up, it will be difficult for him to live normally. We can't leave the chairman's position of Dongju vacant forever. As the eldest, I'll take the role. I believe no one will have any objections."

At that moment.

"Who said you could do that?"

The sharp voice turned everyone's attention in the living room.

Big Uncle's eyes, along with Little Uncle's and Aunt's, widened in shock.

The reason was simple. Grandfather was walking in, looking healthy.
