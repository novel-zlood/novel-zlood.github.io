"Father, are you going to see Mother?"

The mansion in Ichon-dong was filled with a savory aroma because Chairman Yoo was making pumpkin pancakes.

Though he was over seventy, whenever Chairman Yoo made pumpkin pancakes, his wrinkled eyes gleamed with excitement.

Kang Hyunja thought her father was quite the romantic. After all, it had been decades since her mother passed away, and he had never looked at another woman.

"Hyunja, do you know why your mother loved pumpkin pancakes so much? Even after our business flourished in Seoul, she preferred pumpkin pancakes over beef. Do you know why?"

Kang Hyunja didn't know. She had very few memories of her mother, just faint recollections.

The only memory she had was of her mother happily eating pumpkin pancakes. When eating them, her mother looked as if she were eating the finest delicacies.

Her bright smile was enough to remind Kang Hyunja of her mother in her younger days.

"Your mother worked as a maid in your father's house when she was young. She had no one to rely on and was practically sold to a wealthy family in Chungbuk. It must have been so tough for her. There were many maids in your father's household, and the young girl faced a lot of hostility. Her face would crack in the cold, and her hands would blister from doing laundry in the stream during summer."

Kang Hyunja didn't know much about her mother's younger days.

She only knew that her father and mother had a forbidden love, which was frowned upon back then.

After all, her mother was as gentle and graceful as a noble lady in her youth.

"She was a kind-hearted person. Even when she had nothing to eat, she would break her rice balls and share them with begging children on the street. How could I not fall for her after seeing that? During feasts, I would secretly bring her various foods."

"Was pumpkin pancakes one of those foods?"

"Yes, she felt guilty about me bringing meat all the time. So, she lied that pumpkin pancakes were the most delicious. The memory of those times stayed with me even as I grew old. When I brought her pumpkin pancakes, she saw me not as a young master but as a man named Yoo Dongyul. Though your mother has been gone for a long time."

Every year on his wife's birthday, Chairman Yoo would make pumpkin pancakes by hand and never forget a glass of milk she loved.

As the pumpkin pancakes turned golden brown, the excitement in Chairman Yoo's eyes grew.

"In my heart, she is still alive."

As if he were meeting his first love.

“From John Calvin’s side?”

It was an unexpected story.

“Yes, Maestro and Vice President John know each other.”

Another vice president of Calvin Pharmaceuticals had visited the mansion. Moreover, he was said to be acquainted with Maestro.

A tea time was already underway beyond the garden. Judging by Karas’s beaming smile, he seemed to be more than just an acquaintance to Vice President John.

At that moment.

Huh?

Karas, who was enjoying tea time beyond the garden, made eye contact with me. It seemed as if he was asking me if I wanted to join the tea time.

“Hyun, this is John Calvin, someone I cherish very much. He was a close friend of my child when they were young.”

Before I knew it,

“John, this is Hyun, the young maestro who is causing a sensation in the music world. He is one of the musicians who will lead the classical music scene in the future.”

I found myself seated at the tea time.

John Calvin was different from his half-brother Gerard Calvin not just in appearance but also in speech.

If Vice President Gerard seemed like an unrefined nouveau riche, Vice President John exuded the aura of a researcher, similar to Dr. Tikhonov.

“I have already heard a lot about you, Hyun. You are famous worldwide as a musician and also as the head of an investment company. Ah, please do not misunderstand. Today’s visit is purely for a meeting with Maestro, not for business.”

Though it seemed like I could see through his intentions, I decided to tolerate it. With Maestro smiling so brightly, what else could I do?

“John, thank you for always remembering Anna’s birthday.”

“It’s nothing. It’s natural to care for a friend. Maestro, you don’t have to feel so burdened.”

Anna’s birthday?

“I brought a Sacher Torte that Anna liked. I hope you and Anna enjoy it together.”

“Thank you so much. Anna would really love it.”

It sounded as if Anna were still alive. As the conversation continued, Maya suddenly approached and whispered to Maestro.

“Oh dear, I completely forgot that I had another appointment today. I’m sorry, but could I leave first?”

Of course, Maestro didn’t need my permission, so I naturally saw him off.

After Maestro left the garden, only John Calvin and I remained, staring at each other.

The first to speak was John Calvin.

“Once again, please do not misunderstand. Today's visit is truly for Maestro’s daughter Anna’s birthday.”

“I understand. But may I ask you something?”

“Of course.”

Why do you speak as if Anna is still alive?

“I don’t know if you’re aware, but Maestro believes Anna is still alive. From seventeen years ago when Anna left this world until now. Every year on her birthday, I bring the Sacher Torte she liked. It’s the last thing I can do for a friend.”

John Calvin’s eyes reflected memories and sadness from the past.

How much time had passed? After shaking off the sadness, John Calvin looked at me and asked.

“May I ask you a question now?”

Of course,

“Why didn't you sell your shares to Vice President Gerard?”

“Is that something you’re really curious about?”

“Yes, I originally didn’t intend to ask such a thing today, but since the opportunity arose, I’m asking. Surely Vice President Gerard’s offer was better than ours.”

John Calvin’s expression still showed confusion. Of course, it was no secret that Vice President John was significantly outmatched by Vice President Gerard in terms of capital.

But my reason for refusing was simple.

“Because he was arrogant.”

* * *

Gulp.

Chief Kim Sang-guk realized that the person sitting across from him was excessively nervous.

After all, it was VH Company, a renowned investment firm, that had requested the meeting.

“Your company is developing the safety of lithium-ion batteries, correct?”

“Yes, but it’s not progressed enough to be called development yet...”

“We are already aware of that.”

The young representative of the venture company looked barely old enough to be a college freshman.

I heard he dropped out of college to start his venture company. Ever since Bill Gates of Microsoft succeeded, there was a boom in dropping out of college to start businesses. This representative seemed to be one of those.

“How many employees do you have in total?”

“Just three, including myself.”

“Are they college friends?”

The curly-haired representative slowly nodded.

Chief Kim Sang-guk still couldn’t understand. In terms of development results and progress, they were at a college club level. It was more accurate to call them a club rather than a company. But,

“We will support all your research costs and facilities through VH Company.”

“What?”

“First, take a look at the contract.”

The representative’s eyes widened. The numbers in the contract were ones he had never even dreamed of.

Moreover, the contract terms were extremely favorable to them. If Chief Kim Sang-guk hadn't been from VH Company, the representative would have suspected it was a scam.

“I don’t understand. If our company fails to achieve proper development results, VH Company will incur significant losses due to the contract structure, right?”

“That’s correct. If your company fails in the research and development of lithium-ion battery safety, VH Company will lose both the investment funds and opportunity costs. Conversely, if your company succeeds, VH Company will make significant profits.”

“I really don’t understand. Does VH Company trust us that much?”

Of course, they were just beginners who hadn’t even been established for a year.

Chief Kim Sang-guk shook his head internally. It wasn’t that he found the curly-haired man in front of him trustworthy. The man didn’t seem to have any business acumen. But,

“Our representative fully trusts your company.”

* * *

By now, Chief Kim Sang-guk would be meeting the young representative of Dream Company.

In the future, they would succeed in developing the safety of lithium-ion batteries. Although they started in a shabby place like a container house, their end would be grand.

How do I know them?

In my past life, their success in lithium-ion battery safety echoed loudly worldwide for days.

I never expected to meet them in their younger days in Austria. It was like hitting the jackpot.

‘Chief, don’t worry. It’s not a losing business.’

Chief Kim Sang-guk had been so worried that he had spent hours trying to persuade me.

But I couldn’t exactly say, ‘I saw them succeed in developing lithium-ion battery safety in my past life.’

Of course, from Chief Kim Sang-guk’s perspective, it would seem like a charity.

At that moment,

“Oppa, there really was a child!”

It was that story again. Yooha was saying something ridiculous.

She claimed to have seen a child in room 0703 a few days ago. She must have mistaken the weeping Maestro for a child.

“Yooha, you were just so scared that you saw things.”

“But it’s true.”

“Yooha, today is your first lesson with Maestro, so let’s talk about this later.”

Son Yooha still shook her head and puffed out her cheeks.

She looked so cute that I wanted to pinch her cheeks, but there wasn’t enough time. Today was the first day of Karas’s direct lesson.

“Hyun, come quickly.”

Unusually, the location for the conducting lesson was in the forest facing the garden. Since I had expected a studio filled with musical equipment, it was an exception.

At that moment, Karas picked up a stick that had fallen in the forest.

Then,

Swoosh.

The end of the stick seemed to cut through the space, resonating through the forest.

It was a simple conducting gesture, but the resonance of the forest turned into music and echoed in my ears as if magic were being performed.

Wasn’t she called the legendary maestro? It was Karas’s conducting, which I had never seen even in my past life.

The movement flowed from her shoulders, through her fingers, and reached the baton. It was different from any conducting I had known.

I heard she hadn’t conducted for a long time. But Karas’s skills were not just intact but incredibly impressive.

I finally recalled the words of the eternal Maestro Gustav. He said the pinnacle of the 20th century was not him but the empress, Karas.

At that moment,

Karas clenched her fist in the air.

Then, as if the conducting had ended, the resonance of the forest ceased.

Karas turned to me and spoke.

“Hyun, do you remember my movements just now?”

How could I forget? Each scene was etched in my mind like the climax of a movie. It felt like a dream.

When I nodded, Karas smiled and continued.

“Do it ten thousand times the same way.”
