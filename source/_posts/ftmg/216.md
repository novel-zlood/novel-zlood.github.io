“Hoo―!”

Tommy steadied his breath, sweating coldly.

Whenever the clear melody seemed to falter even a little, Kang Hyun's warnings would pierce his ears like a ghost.

It was the same when his legs holding the cello tensed up. Kang Hyun would tap his legs with a red pen.

Gulp.

Kang Hyun treated Tommy as if he were teaching a beginner how to play.

It would be a lie to say his pride wasn't hurt at all. After all, the Royal Academy of Music was a place where only prodigies who were considered top-tier in the music world gathered.

Tommy was also recognized as a prodigy back in Cambridge. However, the more he received guidance from Kang Hyun, the more he realized that such thoughts were mere arrogance.

“Stop overthinking.”

Twitch.

“Just focus on your posture―!”

His entire body was tense, as if it were the first day he had learned to play the cello. To exaggerate, he wasn't even this nervous when he first received a lesson from Professor Albert.

Kang Hyun's gaze was not the usual gentle look. It was as if he could read people's minds, with deep eyes that seemed to penetrate him.

“From the beginning again.”

Tommy looked at the first page of the sheet music again. Was it a piece composed by Kang Hyun? No, it was Bach's Prelude No. 1.

Kang Hyun gave Tommy a piece of advice as he started playing again.

“Tommy, don't be trapped by fixed ideas.”

Fixed ideas, Tommy thought as he looked at the sheet music.

On the sheet music written by Bach with a quill, numerous notes sat with their own emotions.

Musicians understand the composer's heart and interpret the sheet music. Bach's Prelude has been played repeatedly by many greats.

The interpretation of the Prelude varied. Some played it slower, others faster.

Though it is now one of Bach's representative pieces, the Prelude was not popular when it was first performed.

Therefore, no musician of that era tried to understand Bach's heart.

But a gem always shines. Wasn't the Prelude re-evaluated by the 20th-century cello maestro, Pablo Casals?

Since then, countless musicians have been enchanted by Bach's Prelude.

In the end, it was only after hundreds of years that musicians started to search for Bach's heart in the notes on a sheet of music from centuries ago.

How much time had passed?

“Abandon old emotions, and let it flow like water.”

Tommy briefly defined his interpretation of the Prelude.

It was somewhat abstract. But at that moment, Kang Hyun was smiling brighter than ever.

As if he had been waiting, the bow was lifted. Kang Hyun sensed it. Surely, the moment the bow and strings touched, the unique heaviness of the cello would disappear, and a fluid tone like flowing water would unfold.

“He submitted an application to participate?”

Professor Albert had a look of disbelief.

“I can't believe it either. But we received a letter this morning expressing his desire to participate in the concert.”

Dixon, who had worked at the Royal Academy of Music for a long time, felt the same.

The Royal Academy of Music concert was a tradition with a long history. It was common for illustrious alumni of the academy to perform at the concert. However...

“He's never applied to participate in our concert before, has he?”

“No, he's always been too busy...”

“Moreover, he applied as a violinist?!”

Professor Albert still couldn't understand it.

In fact, he was one of the most renowned maestros produced by the Royal Academy of Music. Dixon asked with a hint of curiosity.

“Could it be that the president requested it?”

Rumor had it that President Samuel and he were classmates at the Royal Academy of Music.

There were even talks that they were close friends.

“That’s not it.”

President Samuel, who appeared out of nowhere, said with a smile.

“That friend wouldn't come even if I asked him to. Not as the president, nor even as the crown prince. He's a very stubborn friend who would vanish like the wind if you tried to catch him. Nonetheless, I think I know why he applied for the concert.”

Albert and Dixon turned their gazes toward President Samuel.

“Isn't it because of his student?”

“His student? Oh, you mean because of Hyun!”

Professor Albert exclaimed in realization as President Samuel nodded.

“Still, it's surprising. That he applied not as a conductor, but as a violinist.”

“President, if you don't mind me asking, did the maestro originally major in violin?”

“He was a genius in music. Though he majored in conducting, he excelled in violin, piano, and all orchestral instruments. When he was at the Royal Academy of Music, not only the conducting professors but also professors from other disciplines admired him. I really look forward to this concert. Hahaha.”

President Samuel laughed heartily as he walked away.

Albert and Dixon's gazes were still fixed on the application form. The name of Maestro Spencer, the pride of England and the chief conductor of the London Symphony, was written there.

* * *

“Geniuses of the era...”

Kang Hyun thought of Sabrina and Tommy. Compared to his past life, their musical talents were soaring.

Thanks to that, he could come into contact with many great maestros he had never met in his lifetime.

Starting with the eternal maestro Gustav, the pride of England Spencer, Germany's Yuri, Russia's Alexei, and the empress Karas.

One question arose when he came to the Royal Academy of Music as an exchange student.

Would there be anyone so outstanding that they would leave a greater impact than those who came before him?

But those he mentioned were all great musicians.

However,

It was a misjudgment and arrogance. Sabrina and Tommy, whom he met at the Royal Academy of Music, shook his musical worldview to its core.

Especially in Sabrina's case, it was puzzling. Why hadn't such an excellent performer made a name for herself in the future?

Knock knock.

Then, there was a knock on the door.

“Sabrina?”

It was late into the evening. However, Sabrina entered Kang Hyun's room with sheet music in one hand.

“This is the men's dormitory, you know?”

“What does it matter?”

In some ways, it was a forbidden zone. However, Sabrina handed the sheet music to Kang Hyun without a care. It was a piece composed by Kang Hyun, but at some point, Sabrina had been arranging it with him.

As soon as Kang Hyun took the sheet music from Sabrina, he realized why she had come to him.

“You want to extend the cello part?”

“Yeah, Tommy is quite good now.”

Sabrina could also see Tommy's potential clearly. That's why she nodded approvingly when he was accepted as part of the trio.

At that moment, Sabrina looked at the freckled boy Tommy, who was fast asleep on Kang Hyun's bed, and asked,

“How long has he been sleeping like that?”

“He's been asking me all day about the interpretation of the sheet music. He looked so tired, so I told him to take a nap. After all, we'll be practicing all day tomorrow.”

Tommy was hugging Kang Hyun’s pillow like a doll, deeply asleep.

Tommy would put his all into practice, as if he were going to die. Among the three, he was the one who pushed himself the hardest.

That was because he was worried about causing trouble for Kang Hyun and Sabrina.

“Then I'll stay here and work on the arrangement a bit.”

“Here?”

“Yeah, there's no time. We might as well match it together. And I need to keep an eye on you.”

“What do you mean?”

“Didn't you know? Tommy likes you.”

Nonsense.

Before Kang Hyun could say anything, Sabrina had already pulled a chair next to him and started correcting the sheet music, her silver hair swaying.

How much time had passed?

All night long, Kang Hyun and Sabrina continued their arrangement work. There wasn't much conversation.

They communicated everything through music, playing short pieces whenever they had doubts.

As dawn began to filter through the window.

“Uuugh.”

Tommy groaned, rolling over in Kang Hyun's bed. In a daze, he squinted and saw the silver-haired girl sitting on the bed.

‘Isn't that prickly Sabrina? Hehehe.’

He clearly remembered sleeping in Kang Hyun's bed. Since it was the men's dormitory, Sabrina couldn't have come in. It must all be a dream.

Sabrina turned her head at the sound of movement and looked at Tommy. At that moment, Tommy smiled foolishly and patted Sabrina's head. He wouldn't have done that if it were reality.

Then,

“Tommy, what are you doing?”

Kang Hyun asked curiously, with a towel around his neck. Only then did Tommy's blurry vision clear, and he met Sabrina's turquoise eyes head-on.

Eek―!

Tommy hiccuped and jumped up from his seat.

* * *

Why on earth...

“Why did I do that...”

Tommy was pulling at his hair endlessly. His big eyes were teary, as if they would soon shed all his freckles.

He had ruffled Sabrina's hair, thinking it was a dream. If Kang Hyun had spoken to him a little later, he might have pinched Sabrina's cheeks as well.

The moment he realized it wasn't a dream but reality, Sabrina's turquoise eyes looked so scary that he reflexively jumped up and ran out of Kang Hyun's room.

He should go and apologize to Sabrina right now, but his heart and his courage weren't aligning. Then,

Thud.

A plate of bacon and omelet was placed in front of Tommy.

“Tommy, why are you burying your face in the plate again?”

It was Kang Hyun.

“Hyun?”

Tommy quickly looked around, thinking Sabrina might have come with him. Fortunately, Kang Hyun was alone.

Kang Hyun seemed to read Tommy's mind and chuckled.

“Sabrina said she’s tired and went to sleep.”

“Hyun, why was Sabrina in your room this morning?”

“She came to ask about the sheet music last night. She didn’t seem to care much about being in the men's dormitory. Since you were already sleeping in my room, we worked on the arrangement together.”

Hmph.

Ordinary students would have been too afraid of the dorm supervisor to break the dorm rules, but Sabrina was different. She was unique among the many students the Royal Academy of Music had produced.

“Hyun, do you think Sabrina is very angry...?”

Normally, she was reluctant to show her performance to others. Given that she was extremely averse to people touching her, she was likely to be very upset.

Kang Hyun put down his fork and, after a moment of thought, said,

“Hmm, why don’t you ask her yourself?”

“Ask her?”

Just then,

“Tommy.”

A familiar voice called. Tommy glanced over and saw strands of silver hair.

As Tommy lowered his head and avoided her gaze, Kang Hyun smiled faintly. Seeing this, Sabrina narrowed her eyes and asked,

“Tommy, is drinking soup with your nose a hobby?”

“N-no, that’s not it. Sabrina, I’m really, really sorry about what happened this morning. I really thought it was a dream...”

“You wanted to mess up my hair that badly in your dream?”

“No, it’s not that...”

The more he spoke, the more he felt like he was digging himself into a hole.

“I’m okay.”

“Really?”

“Yes, but I want you to apologize with a perfect cello performance. Hyun and I finished the arrangement last night. If you play well, I’ll forgive you this once.”

Tommy jumped up and grabbed Sabrina's hands. Everyone's eyes were on them, and Tommy nodded repeatedly at Sabrina.

“Thank you!”

“Huh?”

“I’ll do my best―!”
