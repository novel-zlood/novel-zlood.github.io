"Are you asking about the monetary value?"

There are three devils in the Gramophone.

"The first album of the violinist Hyun was undoubtedly a masterpiece."

Dante, the representative and chief editor of Gramophone, smiled faintly.

The first album of the violinist Hyun was enough to capture the hearts of classical critics.

Moreover, wasn't the entire album comprised of solo pieces, concertos, and symphonies that he composed himself?

For half a century, such an album had never been seen or heard of. It was as if a sensation had been created in the once static sea of classical music.

"As a classical critic, I can say that the original compositions of the violinist Hyun have immense value. They have a significant influence not only in the field of classical music but also in films and even in commercial aspects. You know, don't you, that famous Hollywood directors are sending love calls to Hyun?"

The people enchanted by Kang Hyun were not only in Hollywood.

"Moreover, we also have many ardent fans of Hyun at Gramophone. Especially Adam Whishaw and Sharon, the chief editors known for their sharp criticisms and reviews on classical music, are representative fans. You can tell by the fact that they, who usually didn't take charge of the Asian region, rushed to fly to Korea."

Dante fully understood their sentiments. Hadn't it been announced that new original compositions would be performed at Kang Hyun's solo concert? He, too, would have flown to Korea, abandoning everything if he weren't the representative of Gramophone.

"I heard that the concert hall, which holds over 2,000 seats, sold out in just ten minutes. And it's not even an orchestra performance but just a violinist's solo concert. To have that kind of impact, it would be impossible unless you were a renowned maestro in Europe. Especially in Asia, which is considered a barren land for classical music, it must be a tremendous sensation, wouldn't you say?"

Dante twitched his cheek. The slight upward curve of his lips showed how delighted he was.

"Surely, this solo concert of Hyun will stir the winds not only in the classical music world but in various fields. Not only did EMA, the prestigious European company, but also Deutsche directly got involved, and numerous related personnel visited Korea. That shows how captivating Hyun's unpublished original compositions are."

Moreover, weren't his dark green eyes gleaming as if smiling?

"Let's go back to the first question."

"Yes?"

"You asked about the monetary value of Hyun's original compositions. My answer is simple."

The first devil of Gramophone asked without hesitation.

"If Van Gogh came back to life and painted again, how would it be evaluated?"

'The first piece to replace the greeting?'

Renowned figures in classical music, including European maestros, leaned forward. They hadn't expected him to start playing right away, replacing the greeting.

It showed how much pride he had in the piece.

Between eyes filled with a mix of doubt and fascination, two Stradivarius violins came into view.

However, their doubts were completely transformed into excitement the moment the bow touched the strings.

Saaah.

The audience unconsciously held their breath.

It was as if they were watching the contrast between a frigid moon and a scorching sun, with fantasy and joy playing contrasting melodies.

It wasn't about external embellishments or high-level techniques. It was a performance relying solely on melody, as if they were facing each other head-on, incomparable to anything else.

The eyes and ears of the audience were already captivated by fantasy and joy.

Furururuk!

As the ends of the black tuxedo and the red dress fluttered, the bow and strings gleamed fiercely.

The two were facing each other, playing the violin, but their eyes were closed.

At that moment, Kang Hyun slightly opened his eyes first.

The bow roughly slid down the strings. It was like a fantasy swiftly charging forward, resembling the sound of galloping hooves.

The right hand holding the bow gradually accelerated, and the fingers pressing the strings with the left hand moved as if dancing.

At that moment, Hirose, as if chasing after the sprinting fantasy, half-opened his eyes.

As if joy was following in the footsteps of fantasy, he pursued the melody exactly. Although it was a sequence of the same notes, it felt like listening to a different piece.

The audience felt their palms sweating.

Their hearts pounded and their lips parched with anticipation as they watched the performance of Kang Hyun and Hirose.

'This is maddening.'

The violinists, known as European maestros, felt a chill down their spine as they watched the collaboration of Kang Hyun and Hirose.

The meticulously structured form of the piece reminded them of Bach's compositions.

As if chasing each other, the two violins imitated each other perfectly. Although it resembled a fugue, it was entirely different in the final confrontation.

Even though they were playing the same piece as if they were mirrors, it sounded like different songs.

Perhaps it was due to the twist in technique and bowing direction. And that wasn't the end of it.

Hirose's experience and expertise, being called Japan's greatest maestro, were flawless.

However, Kang Hyun's level had long surpassed astonishment. He didn't seem to be at a disadvantage even when performing alongside a maestro. It was as if they had been performing together for a long time.

The rumor that Kang Hyun's violin skills had declined because he pursued a career as a conductor was false.

Hadn't he grown even more over the years?

At that moment.

Ziiing―!

Hirose's joy began a solo. This time, Kang Hyun's fantasy fiercely chased after it. The bowing was so fast that the bow seemed like a blade. People wondered if the strings would break, but they only gleamed more as time passed.

Watching the combination of the fluttering red dress and black tuxedo, European violinists thought.

If it were them, could they perform such perfect counterpoint on stage?

For instance, if the owners of fantasy and joy weren't the ones on stage, it would be nearly impossible to create such a beautiful harmony.

'Teacher.'

Kang Hyun looked at Hirose. It was time to decorate the finale of the first piece. It was Hirose's favorite part of the performance.

Hirose's left hand pizzicato struck the strings intensely.

His face was filled with deep emotion. When playing with Kang Hyun, his once aching shoulders and arms felt like they were back in their prime.

As Hirose's melody reached its end.

Kang Hyun strongly drew his bow on the strings of fantasy. The fierce cross of the bow brought about a chilling and transparent melody.

The audience felt a cool breeze piercing through their bodies at the end of the performance.

* * *

Austin, the representative of the prestigious European company EMA, licked his dry lips. Although the first performance had ended, the lingering feeling was endlessly regretful.

It felt as if he had dreamed a fantastic dream. It wasn't just Austin who felt this way. Other audience members had similar expressions.

'We must sign a contract.'

Austin was already considering Kang Hyun's second album.

Hadn't the first album decorated the end of the 20th century with a splendid debut?

It was almost unprecedented for a classical newcomer to receive such global attention. Especially, the sales had far exceeded expectations.

Considering it wasn't from a world-renowned orchestra or a famous maestro, it was more than extraordinary—it was almost a miracle.

The 80s and 90s were undoubtedly the heyday of pop and rock bands. Starting with The Beatles, followed by Eagles, Billy Joel, Green Day, and Iris.

Hadn't Kang Hyun already composed the title for Iris a few years ago?

At that time, the French composer and singer-songwriter Michel Piccoli, who assisted with Kang Hyun's production, had evaluated him as a genius of the century.

'How much initial stock should we prepare?'

Austin couldn't predict what kind of global sales Kang Hyun's second album would achieve.

Although he hadn't heard all the remaining pieces yet, if the first piece was this remarkable, there was no need to think further.

"Austin, you came too?"

"Simon Brül? Weren't you supposed to be in the United States?"

"I postponed my meeting with the New York Orchestra. As the representative of Deutsche, I couldn't miss a performance like this."

It was Simon Brül, the representative of Deutsche, a German classical music company.

In classical sound and recording, the two were unrivaled. They exchanged glances and shook hands as if competing with each other.

There seemed to be an inexplicable tension. Naturally, wouldn't it be?

Both Austin and Simon instinctively felt it. Kang Hyun's second album would mark a milestone in classical music history.

Without having time to savor the lingering feeling, the once-quiet concert hall became lively again.

It was because Baek Jung-hoon was stepping onto the stage. Wasn't he the pianist who had turned to a conductor due to tendonitis?

There were rumors that he had secluded himself in Russia and studied under the world-renowned maestro Maxim Ivanov.

Some people even rubbed their eyes with their sleeves to confirm his face.

Was it because of conducting or the passage of time? His once gentle impression had become somewhat sharp and stern, yet it suited the current Baek Jung-hoon very well.

When he sat on the piano chair, the moment of Baek Jung-hoon's appearance, which had only been a rumor, became a reality.

Tap.

As Kang Hyun, dressed in a black tuxedo, walked out, the eyes of the European violinists widened.

It was because of the violin in his hand. It wasn't the fantasy he had just performed with Hirose. It was the Guarneri Fiore, which had briefly appeared a few years ago and then disappeared.

Hadn't someone said? If Stradivarius was the ocean and deep sea, then Guarneri del Gesu was the vast land.

When related personnel, who had heard Fiore's melody during the filming of the movie "Paganini" a few years ago, spoke, it was with admiration that went beyond awe.

When he played Fiore himself, it felt like stepping into a scene from a salon hundreds of years ago.

When the bow slowly touched the strings, the sound of gulping could be heard as an accompaniment.

As if having two faces, sometimes a mournful melody pierced the ears, and at other times a splendid melody filled the eyes with emotion.

As the bow began to fiercely cross the strings after a mesmerizing glissando, it resembled the start of "The Queen's Portamento" from Hyun's first album.

But at that moment, as if adding laughter, the piano's melody became richer.

Baek Jung-hoon's long fingers smoothly crossed the piano keys.

It was so fluid that it was hard to believe these were the hands suffering from tendonitis. Each press of the keys, from the shoulders to the elbows to the fingertips, felt like an artistic movement.

As the intense gazes of the two men met, their lips slowly curved upward as if looking into a mirror.

The audience could all feel it. The two performers were communicating as if reading each other's thoughts without speaking.

The strength of the bow pressing down matched the rough movements of the keys. As if indulging in each other, the resonance of the piano and the melody of the violin pushed and pulled each other.

With thin breaths flowing down their chins, a thick tension settled over the concert hall.

Ziiing―!

At that moment, a splendid high note soared to the ceiling. The audience couldn't help but be amazed by not only Kang Hyun but also Baek Jung-hoon's skills.

It was known that he hadn't played the piano for a long time, yet here he was, delivering such a dense performance.

Moreover, the two looked incredibly beautiful.

The reporters were deeply regretful that they couldn't capture this moment in a photo.

It was truly an ideal painting, as if a single breath was divided into two.
