Although the first part of the recital had ended, the heat in the concert hall showed no signs of subsiding.

The collaboration with Hirose, a master from Japan, along with the appearance of pianist Baek Junghoon, who had transitioned to a conductor, was more than enough to make the audience's hearts race.

But the highlight was none other than Kang Hyun's violin skills.

The image of him as a violinist, which people thought had faded over the past two years, had instead become even more refined and sharp.

"He was really like Yasha Heifetz."

His bowing had reached a level of maturity beyond flashy techniques.

He vibrated the strings as if communicating with the violin, and his smooth slur staccato was enough to make people gasp.

His eyes, directed at the tip of the bow, were infinitely sharp at that moment.

As the eternal maestro Gustav once said, his appearance was strikingly similar to that of the legendary violinist Yasha Heifetz.

"His playing skills are one thing, but I'm more amazed by his compositions."

"I agree. No European composer could imitate his structure. James, what do you think?"

"It felt like I was dreaming while watching his performance. Haven't we all imagined something like this at least once when we first learned music as children? It felt like that dream had become a reality. At such a young age, he has Heifetz's skills and Mozart's composition. It's really driving me crazy."

The European masters were busy sharing their impressions. The deep resonance not only enveloped their entire bodies but also made them feel an awe that went beyond mere admiration.

Those who had only heard rumors about the violinist Hyun and saw him in person were all in shock.

The emotions filled with excitement and inspiration enveloped the concert hall like waves.

"Old friend, you really have an amazing grandson. In my entire life, I've never seen such a thrilling violin recital. Before it started, the foreign guests were all sitting quietly, but now they can't hide their excitement."

Chairman Wang also commented on Hyun's performance.

It was a continuous performance without even a single greeting.

Considering the usual image of classical music, it might have seemed somewhat boring, but Kang Hyun's recital was different.

After each piece, the audience exhaled the breath they had been holding and eagerly awaited the next piece.

"I feel like I could die without any regrets now. Seeing how well my Hyun has grown."

"Old friend, what nonsense are you talking about on such a good day? Moreover, thanks to Hyun, you've been taking care of your health. I've never seen a grandson worry so much about his grandfather's health. My third son would probably just be waiting for me to die. Anyway, don't even think about going into the coffin before our grandchildren's wedding."

Indeed, the two grandfathers were over seventy years old, but they looked at least ten years younger.

Chairman Wang grasped Chairman Yoo's wrinkled hand. They were lifelong friends who had been together in the Korean business world.

The two grandfathers looked at each other and smiled faintly.

Baek Junghoon looked down at his fingers. They were the same hands that had suffered from tendonitis. But when he performed with Kang Hyun, it was as if he forgot about the pain and danced.

He thought his passion for the piano had diminished while learning to conduct, but he was mistaken.

When he pressed the piano keys in tune with Kang Hyun's violin melody, it was as if a volcano erupted with emotion.

"Junghoon, you were really amazing."

"Thank you, teacher."

Hirose praised Baek Junghoon. They had collaborated together early on.

Hirose was called the heroine of Japan, and Baek Junghoon had firmly established his position as a pianist in Asia.

For both of them to perform together as collaborators was quite an unusual event.

"The collaboration between Hyun and Junghoon was truly amazing, even before. It felt like they were lovers."

"What?"

"It's quite difficult to share such perfect harmony, even with long-time collaborators. In that sense, you two are blessed. Of course, I'm also blessed to have performed with Hyun. Didn't you feel the gazes of other classical musicians on stage?"

Baek Junghoon couldn't pretend not to understand what Hirose was saying. As always, when he stood on stage and received the audience's gaze, he felt a thrill throughout his body.

Among the eyes filled with excitement and anticipation were also the gazes of masters.

Perhaps because he specialized in classical music, they all looked at him with intense and deep eyes.

How could he not understand the hidden meaning behind those gazes? By now, the masters who had snapped out of their reverie probably all had the same thought.

They wanted to stand on that stage with Kang Hyun.

"Teacher, I'll go see Hyun for a moment."

"Alright. Starting from the second part, Hyun will be performing solo, so he'll be even more nervous. It would be great if you could go and help him calm down."

Baek Junghoon bowed politely to Hirose and headed to Kang Hyun's waiting room. He approached the waiting room and knocked, but there was no response.

Was he meditating? Just then, the door slowly opened.

"Whew."

Kang Hyun let out a deep sigh and rotated his shoulders widely.

Had he prepared too hard for the recital over the past few months? His shoulder was acting up at this crucial moment.

It was probably inevitable, given that many of the pieces required high-level techniques.

"Hyun, are you okay?"

While he was briefly icing his troublesome shoulder, Baek Junghoon came into the waiting room.

Kang Hyun nodded silently and smiled. He couldn't show any weakness here.

"Your palm is bleeding too."

"I gripped the bow too tightly, so the callus burst. It's no big deal. I'm fine."

How much practice does it take for a callus to burst? Baek Junghoon was also known for his hard work, but he couldn't compare to Kang Hyun.

Didn't he feel it every time they rehearsed together? Kang Hyun's focus was so intense that it was astonishing.

Once he concentrated, even Baek Junghoon, who watched from the side, was amazed.

"Will you be okay for the second part?"

Baek Junghoon's question was simple. The pieces in the second part all required high-level techniques.

In a way, it wasn't an exaggeration to say that the highlights of this recital were all in the second part. The audience would feel even more moved and excited than in the first part.

Kang Hyun silently gripped the bow in his right hand even tighter. It seemed that nothing could stop Kang Hyun's effort and determination.

"A genius of the century? A resurrected Paganini?"

The editor of DailyQ was racking his brain to decide on the headline.

It might seem like an excessive phrase, but for those who had seen Kang Hyun's recital, it might even feel insufficient.

The audience, filling more than 2,000 seats, were not ordinary people. Masters of the classical world, who were rarely seen even in Europe, were present.

"Kim Saetbyeol, how much longer do you think it will take?"

"I should be able to finish the final draft in thirty minutes."

"There's no need to exaggerate. Just write exactly what you saw and felt!"

Usually, when writing a review of a classical recital, it was customary to use exaggerated expressions. It was almost a convention to follow with flowery language and adjectives.

However, Kang Hyun's recital was different. The collaboration with Japan's master Hirose and Korea's next-generation master pianist Baek Junghoon was amazing, but undoubtedly, the highlight was the second part.

"If his second album comes out, it will be incredible."

"Don't even mention it, editor. Didn't you see the directors of EMA and Deutsche heading to the waiting room right after the second part ended? They looked as anxious as people needing to use the bathroom."

It was completely understandable that the directors of EMA and Deutsche were captivated.

The second part of the recital was a continuous display of high-level techniques, as if Niccol√≤ Paganini had been resurrected.

The notes on the staff were densely packed, almost screaming, and the splendid bowing was so beautiful it was almost miraculous.

Only after the performance ended did it become clear that not only was his shoulder not in good condition, but his palm was also bleeding.

How did he manage to captivate both eyes and ears in such a state? It was almost supernatural.

"Reporter Park, how are the pictures?"

"They came out great!"

A deep smile spread across the editor's face as he received the newly developed photos.

The scene of Baek Junghoon and Kang Hyun standing side by side, facing each other, would undoubtedly move those who had watched the recital.

But that wasn't the climax.

"Yes, this is it!"

The editor exclaimed in delight as he looked at the last photo.

It was a difficult shot to capture, but they managed to get a picture of him on stage after the recital, coming out to greet the audience.

With his palm wrapped in a bandage and standing shoulder to shoulder with Hirose and Baek Junghoon, his matured appearance compared to a few years ago was enough to make many young female students' hearts flutter.

Especially in a black tuxedo, Kang Hyun looked like a work of art.

This photo would undoubtedly be featured with the headline and would be remembered in the history of Korean classical music.

"It's Kang Hyun!"

On the day of the graduation ceremony, there wasn't a single person at school who didn't know my name.

I had made a name for myself as a violinist, but the British royal performance two years ago and this recent recital had undoubtedly caused a huge sensation.

Journalists from music magazines had called me a genius of the century and a resurrected Paganini, attaching such grandiose titles to me.

Moreover, the large photo on the headline showed me with a bandaged right hand, so it was only natural.

Even though it was just a minor injury, as the word spread, it turned into a story of overcoming great pain to deliver a legendary performance.

"Hyun, can I get an autograph?"

"An autograph?"

It was class president Kim Minjung. She was a prodigy who had entered the law department at Korean University, determined to become a public defender.

Usually, she was a sharp and decisive person who served as class president, but at this moment, she was no different from any other girl her age. In fact, she seemed even more embarrassed to stand in front of me.

"Hyun, can I get an autograph too?"

"Teacher, can I get one too, Hyun?"

"Of course. Why don't we take a picture together after I sign?"

Both students and teachers smiled brightly. I felt like a celebrity.

Considering that my face had been prominently featured on the front page of newspapers, it didn't seem like an exaggeration.

The principal had asked me to give a speech as the graduation representative, but I declined. It was a day to mark the end of our academic journeys.

Looking back, it seemed more appropriate to let the students who had spent their school years meaningfully take the spotlight.

"Son!"

"Hyun, congratulations on your graduation."

Just then, my mother approached with a smile. She was holding a bouquet of flowers in both hands.

My father and grandfather followed behind her. We took countless photos with friends, teachers, and family.

In my past life, I had only focused on studying law at Korean University and passing the bar exam. I had never experienced the joy of a graduation ceremony like this.

Then, it happened.

"Oppa!"

While we were taking photos, I heard a familiar voice.

I quickly turned in the direction of the voice and saw Grandpa Wang and Son Yooha walking towards me.

My heart swelled with emotion.

Yooha ran towards me and hugged me tightly, making the grandfathers laugh happily, saying we were acting like we were in a movie.

Who would have thought that being together could make my heart flutter like this? Looking back at my past life, there was no happier memory.

It wasn't just the end of our academic journey; it was the day I realized what true happiness was.
