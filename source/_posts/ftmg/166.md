The first part of the solo recital had ended, but the heat in the concert hall showed no signs of abating.

Not only was there a collaboration with Japan's maestro Hirose, but also the appearance of pianist Baek Junghoon, who had transitioned to a conductor, was more than enough to make the audience's hearts race.

The highlight of the event was none other than Kang Hyun's violin skills.

Contrary to what was thought, his image as a violinist had not faded over the past two years; instead, it had become even more elegant and sharp.

"He was really like Jascha Heifetz."

His bowing had reached a level of maturity beyond dazzling technique.

The way he vibrated the strings as if communicating with the violin, and the seamless slur staccato that followed like flowing water, was enough to make one gasp.

His sharp eyes directed at the tip of the bow were endlessly piercing at that moment.

As the eternal maestro Gustav once said, he resembled the legendary violinist Jascha Heifetz remarkably.

"His performance skills are impressive, but I am more amazed by the form of his compositions."

"I agree. It's a composition that no European composer could imitate. James, what do you think?"

"Watching his performance felt like dreaming. Didn’t we all imagine something like that when we first learned music as children? It was like that dream had become reality. At such a young age, he has the skill of Heifetz and the composition of Mozart. It's driving me crazy."

The European maestros were busy expressing their impressions. They felt a deep lingering resonance that not only constrained their bodies but also evoked a sense of awe beyond admiration.

Those who witnessed the violinist Hyun, who was only known through rumors, seemed to be in shock.

The emotions filled with excitement and inspiration enveloped the concert hall like waves.

"Old man, you really have a great grandson. I've never experienced such a magnificent violin solo recital in my life. Before the solo recital started, the foreigners who were sitting calmly are now unable to hide their excitement."

Chairman Wang also commented on Hyun's performance.

It was a series of performances that continued without a single greeting.

Considering the usual image of classical music, it might have been somewhat boring, but Kang Hyun's solo recital was different.

After each piece ended, the audience let out the breaths they had been holding and eagerly awaited the next piece.

"Son, I feel like I could die without regrets now. Seeing our Hyun grow so well."

"Old man, what nonsense are you spouting on such a good day? Moreover, didn't you take care of your health thanks to Hyun? I've never seen a grandson who worries so much about his grandfather's health. My third son is probably just waiting for me to die. Anyway, don't even dream about entering the coffin before our grandson and granddaughter's wedding."

Indeed, the two grandfathers were over seventy, but they looked so healthy that they seemed at least ten years younger.

Chairman Wang grabbed Chairman Yoo's wrinkled hand. They were lifelong friends who had spent their lives in the South Korean business world together.

The two grandfathers looked at each other and exchanged faint smiles.

Baek Junghoon looked down at his fingers. They were the fingers that had suffered from tendonitis. But when he collaborated with Kang Hyun, it was as if he forgot the pain and danced.

He thought his passion for the piano had diminished while learning to conduct, but he was mistaken.

When he pressed the piano keys to the melody of Kang Hyun's violin, it felt like a volcano was erupting with emotions.

"Junghoon, it was really wonderful."

"Thank you, teacher."

Hirose praised Baek Junghoon. They were two people who had collaborated early on.

Hirose was a female emperor called the hero of Japan, and Baek Junghoon had firmly established his position as a pianist in Asia.

It was quite unusual for the two of them to stand as collaborators at the same time.

"The collaboration between Hyun and Junghoon is truly amazing, as I felt before. It felt like watching two lovers."

"What?"

"Distributing breaths so evenly is difficult even with long-time collaborators. In that sense, the two of you are blessed. Of course, I am also blessed to have collaborated with Hyun. Junghoon, you must have felt the gaze of other classical musicians on stage, right?"

Baek Junghoon knew what Hirose was talking about. Whenever he went on stage and received the audience's gaze, he felt a thrill throughout his body.

Among the eyes filled with excitement and anticipation were also the gazes of great maestros.

Perhaps because he was a professional in classical music, all the eyes looking at him were dense and intense.

How could he not know the hidden meaning behind those eyes? By now, the maestros who had awakened from the appreciation all had the same thought.

They wanted to be on that stage with Kang Hyun.

"Teacher, I'll go see Hyun for a moment."

"Alright. The second part is Hyun's solo recital, so he will be even more nervous. If Junghoon goes and calms his mind, it will be great."

Baek Junghoon bowed politely to Hirose and headed to Kang Hyun's waiting room. He approached the waiting room and knocked, but there was no sound.

Was Hyun perhaps meditating? At that moment, the door slowly opened.

"Whew."

Kang Hyun let out a deep sigh and rotated his shoulders widely.

Had he prepared too hard for the solo recital over the past few months? His shoulders were acting up at the worst possible time.

Considering that many of the pieces required high-level techniques, it might have been inevitable.

"Hyun, are you alright?"

While Hyun was briefly icing his troublesome shoulder, Baek Junghoon came to the waiting room.

Kang Hyun nodded silently and smiled. He couldn't show any weakness here.

"Your palm is bleeding?"

"It burst because I gripped the bow too tightly. It's nothing. I'm fine."

How much practice would it take for calluses to burst? Baek Junghoon was also known for his hard work, but it was incomparable to Hyun.

He had always felt it during rehearsals. Hyun's concentration was astounding to the point of being speechless.

Once he focused and immersed himself, even Baek Junghoon, who watched from the side, was amazed.

"Will you be okay for the second part?"

Baek Junghoon's question was simple. The pieces in the second part all required high-level techniques.

In a way, it was not an exaggeration to say that the highlight performances of the solo recital were all included. The audience would feel even more emotion and excitement than in the first part.

Kang Hyun gripped the bow in his right hand more tightly without a word. Hyun's effort and perseverance seemed unstoppable.

"A genius of the century? The reincarnation of Paganini?"

The editor of DailyQ was racking his brains to decide on the headline.

It might seem like an exaggerated phrase, but for those who watched Kang Hyun's solo recital, it would feel insufficient.

The audience that filled more than two thousand seats were not ordinary people. Great maestros of the classical music world, who were rarely seen even in Europe, were present.

"Kim Saetbyeol, how much longer do you think it will take?"

"I can finish the final draft within thirty minutes."

"There's no need to exaggerate. Just write exactly what you saw and felt!"

When writing reviews of classical solo recitals, it was customary to exaggerate. Flowery expressions and adjectives were treated as a convention.

But Kang Hyun's solo recital was different. The collaboration with Japan's maestro Hirose and Korea's next-generation maestro pianist Baek Junghoon was astounding, but the highlight was undoubtedly the second part.

"If his second album comes out, it will be phenomenal."

"Don't even get me started, editor. Didn't you see the representatives of EMA and Deutsche heading to the waiting room simultaneously after the second part ended? They both looked so anxious, like people who really needed to go to the bathroom."

It was fully understandable why the representatives of EMA and Deutsche were so captivated.

The second part of the solo recital was a series of high-level techniques, as if Niccolò Paganini had come back to life.

The notes on the staff were densely packed as if they were screaming, and the dazzling bowing was not just beautiful but awe-inspiring.

It wasn't until after the performance ended that it was revealed Hyun's shoulder wasn't in good shape, and his palm was bleeding.

How on earth did he captivate both the eyes and ears in such a condition? It was almost supernatural.

"Reporter Park, how did the pictures turn out?"

"They came out great!"

The editor's face lit up with a broad smile as he received the freshly developed photos.

The scene where Baek Junghoon and Kang Hyun stood side by side, looking at each other, would surely move the audience who had watched the solo recital.

But that was not the climax.

"This is it—!"

The editor exclaimed in delight as he looked at the last photo.

They had managed to capture Hyun's appearance on stage after the solo recital had ended.

His bandaged palm, from which blood had been seeping, stood shoulder to shoulder with Hirose and Baek Junghoon.

Compared to a few years ago, his much more matured appearance was enough to make many young female students' hearts flutter.

Especially Kang Hyun in a black tuxedo looked like a painting.

This photo would not only grace the headline but also remain in the history of South Korean classical music for a long time.

"It's Kang Hyun—!"

On the graduation day, back at school, there was no one who didn't know my name.

I had already made a name for myself as a violinist, but the royal performance in England two years ago and this solo recital had undoubtedly caused a sensational stir.

Reporters from music magazines had dubbed me a genius of the century and the reincarnation of Paganini, attaching exaggerated phrases to my name.

Moreover, the large photo in the headline showed my right hand bandaged, so it was no wonder.

Though it was a minor injury, word of mouth had exaggerated it to the point where it became a legendary performance overcoming significant pain.

"Hyun, can I get your autograph?"

"Autograph?"

It was class president Kim Minjeong. She was a prodigy who had entered the law department of Korea University with the ambition of becoming a public defender.

Usually, she was a sharp and decisive girl who had served as class president, but now she was no different from other girls her age. In fact, she seemed more embarrassed to stand in front of me than usual.

"Hyun, can I get your autograph too?"

"Teacher, can I get one too, Hyun?"

"Of course. How about we take a picture together after I sign for everyone?"

Bright smiles bloomed on the faces of both students and teachers. It felt like I had become a celebrity.

Considering my face had been prominently displayed on the front page of newspapers, it wasn’t an exaggeration.

The principal had asked me to give a speech as the graduation representative, but I declined. It was the day of marking the end of the entrance exam life.

When I thought about it, it was more appropriate to let the students who had meaningful school days have the honor.

"Son—!"

"Hyun, congratulations on your graduation."

Just then, my mother walked over with a smile. She was holding flowers in both hands.

My father and grandfather followed her. We took numerous pictures with friends, teachers, and family.

In my past life, I had only focused on entering Korea University's law department and passing the bar exam. I had never felt that a graduation ceremony could be such a happy experience.

At that moment.

"Oppa—!"

As I was taking pictures, I heard a familiar voice.

When I quickly turned my head towards the direction of the sound, there were Chairman Wang and Son Yooha walking towards me.

My heart swelled with emotion.

Because of Yooha, who ran to me and hugged me tightly, the grandfathers happily remarked that we were filming a movie again.

Being together made my heart race like this. Looking back at my past life, there was no memory as happy as this one.
