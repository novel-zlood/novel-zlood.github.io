"Uh?"

For some reason, my wrist feels light.

The once perfectly fitting sleeves of my school uniform have become loose. This is the moment when choosing milk over juice pays off. Any small progress is good. After all, they say that even dust can pile up to make a mountain.

"Hyun—!"

When I went downstairs for breakfast, Dr. Tikhonov greeted me enthusiastically. He was wearing an apron, which was a familiar sight by now.

Mother and the housekeeper liked Dr. Tikhonov, who was amiable and always focused on learning to cook as if it were a serious chemical research.

"Boss, today's breakfast is soybean paste stew and stir-fried spicy pork that I made myself."

Anyone would think he's a chef on a reality show being judged. And grandfather would be the notorious judge.

Dr. Tikhonov's face was clearly tense. I thought he was someone who had erased the DNA of tension from his system, but apparently not.

When grandfather slowly took a big spoonful of the soybean paste stew, Dr. Tikhonov's Adam's apple bobbed noticeably.

"Mmm, very delicious, Doctor."

It was true. The color, the savory smell, and even the taste were impressive. Someone who didn't know might think it was made by an old grandmother with white hair.

Dr. Tikhonov clenched his hands as if he had achieved a great victory inside.

"By the way, Hyuna, what time is your graduation ceremony today?"

"At 1 PM, grandpa."

"Alright, we'll all go together with driver Kim and the housekeeper."

It looked like a big family was going to move. In my previous life, my mother had to attend my middle school graduation alone because my father's laundry was busy. It was then.

"Boss, may I also attend Hyun's graduation ceremony?"

"Of course, I'd be grateful if you came, Doctor."

Even Dr. Tikhonov was saying he would come to the graduation. I just hope he doesn't bring an excessively large bouquet of flowers.

But contrary to my wish, Dr. Tikhonov's face was already full of excitement. It was enough to make someone who didn't know think he was the one graduating.

"Hyun, I heard you are giving the farewell speech as the representative of the graduates?"

"Yes, grandpa."

"Have you prepared well for the speech?"

Of course, in my past life, I prepared for speeches so much that I got used to them, whether they were legal arguments, addresses, or congratulatory speeches. I can't count the number of times I stood on the podium as a representative during my time at the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

Fortunately, the auditorium of Jeil Middle School was spacious. Just from my family, six people were attending.

"Oh, and Yooha's grandfather said he would come to celebrate your graduation too."

"Yooha's grandfather?"

"Yes, he has been saying for days that he must attend your graduation. It looks like Im Hyera will come too."

Aren't these the kind of people you see in economic weekly magazines? I never imagined that a big name in the business world would attend my graduation ceremony.

I had a feeling that the principal might be more nervous than I was.

"Maestro Spencer?"

Yuri couldn't believe his eyes. He had encountered a familiar figure in the hotel lobby.

"It's been a while, Maestro Yuri."

"What brings you here? I thought you were in London for a royal performance."

"The performance ended last week. I came back to Korea briefly for some business. One of our prospective members is graduating from school today."

Yuri's eyebrows raised at the word 'member.' But Spencer was no less formidable.

The hotel manager didn't know what to do with the appearance of these two foreign figures. Their presence was overwhelming, as if witnessing a titanic struggle.

"I am here for the same reason. A student I first taught is graduating today. What a coincidence, isn't it?"

"Maestro Yuri, did you say a student?"

Spencer's eyes widened as he asked again. Only then did Yuri's face show a triumphant expression. Of course, he had taught Kang Hyun, so it was not strange to call him a student.

"Ahem, even if we have a teacher-student relationship, it doesn't affect the decision to join the orchestra. As you know, I was also taught in Vienna but am currently in London. The eternal Maestro Gustav also said that choosing an orchestra is like dressing the soul of a musician. We will have to wait and see which outfit fits best."

The manager's expression grew increasingly uneasy. Both foreigners looked expensive and exuded an incredible aura.

Though their voices were calm, the intensity of their conversation made it seem like they might start fighting any moment. It was like witnessing an argument among nobles from the past.

At that moment.

"It seems we have attracted unwanted attention. I will take my leave first, Maestro Spencer."

Just as Yuri was about to turn around respectfully,

"Maestro Yuri, may I ask you one last question?"

"Of course."

"What did you teach your student?"

Spencer's eyes still showed he didn't understand. Naturally, as he knew the student referred to better than anyone.

Then Yuri smiled faintly, revealing his teeth like a lion's fangs.

"Conducting."

Clap—!

At the sound of clapping, all the members' eyes focused in unison. Their eyes were all alive. Hadn't they practiced tirelessly throughout the winter break?

These were kids who had never prepared for an orchestra. At first, the melodies were all over the place, but now they fit together like cogs in a machine.

The kids who had just finished the final rehearsal had faces filled with a mix of tension and excitement.

"I've collaborated with many orchestras. But you guys have the fiercest hope I've ever seen. Let's show that hope to your parents today."

In reality, I had only collaborated with the London and Belgian symphony orchestras, but aren't they both world-class orchestras?

Of course, the students' skills were incomparable to them, but at times like this, it was important to boost morale.

"Hyuna, do you have a moment?"

It was Jinho, the concertmaster. Hadn't he just been talking seriously with the string section members? He had to decide the direction of the bow and the mood of the melody, so his responsibility was immense. But he couldn't hide his nervousness in front of me.

"Can you check my posture again?"

"Sure."

Was it because of Baek Junghoon's Spartan training? Jinho now played the solo part quite satisfactorily.

The problem was he still didn't trust himself.

"Jinho, you're doing great. So why are you so anxious?"

"My parents are coming today. My father doesn't like me doing music, and he doesn't even know there's a performance."

Isn't he still a young kid who grew up under his parents? At times like this, I, as the elder, had to give him confidence. I felt like a homeroom teacher.

"Don't worry. After seeing today's performance, your father won't be able to resist approving. Jinho, didn't you once tell me your dream was to become a great violinist and join the Berlin Philharmonic? I'm sure the maestro of the Berlin Philharmonic would praise you after seeing today's performance. He'd call you an excellent concertmaster."

"Thanks for saying that, Hyuna."

"I'm not joking."

Yes, I was confident I could surprise the maestro.

"We will now hear the farewell speech from the representative of the graduates, Kang Hyun from Class 7, 3rd year. Please remain quiet."

In this life, I had many occasions to hold a microphone.

As I stood on the podium, I saw the graduates and numerous parents. If it weren't for Jeil Middle School's large auditorium, it would have been impossible to accommodate so many people.

Among the crowd, my grandfather and the old fox stood out.

Meanwhile, the principal, sitting in the front row, had beads of sweat on his forehead.

Tap, tap.

I tapped the microphone twice to test it and then adjusted it to my height.

"First, I would like to express my gratitude to the teachers and classmates who gave me the honor of being the representative of the graduates. They say that an end is just another beginning. To the juniors who gave us a farewell address and to the friends who are about to start a new journey, I would like to say one thing: Do not fear failure."

In a way, it was a message to everyone in the auditorium.

Although not now, this phrase is often quoted in the speeches of famous people in the future.

"I believe that not even attempting because of the fear of failure is a failure in itself. They say that spring only comes after a harsh winter. No one knows what season we are walking through right now. As we leave middle school and start a new journey in high school, do not hesitate to take on challenges for the future. If Columbus had not dared to venture for fear of failure, we would not have discovered the New World. Sometimes, there will be rough waves, and sometimes, you will sail through calm waters. But never forget that you are the captain of your ship as you navigate the sea of life. That is all."

I thought it would be better to give realistic advice rather than a tearful, touching farewell speech since I had been somewhat aloof in school life.

However, after finishing the speech, the audience was so quiet. It was as if the room had absorbed the silence.

Just when I thought the topic might have been too heavy,

Clap—!

The sound of applause and people standing up swept over me like a wave.

* * *

'Don't be nervous.'

It was only when I stood on the podium that I realized I was looking at the members' eyes, not the audience.

It felt like I was a general at the forefront of a battlefield. I made eye contact with each member who had finished tuning their instruments.

I needed to let them know that it was not them who should be nervous, but the audience.

Although it was a small orchestra, hadn't we managed to fit together by now? The murmuring audience fell silent at the serious looks of the members.

I looked at the concertmaster. He nodded firmly with his lips tightly closed when our eyes met.

'Let's do this.'

As my hand slowly rose into the air, the massive instrument began to move.

Piano—!

Following the sharp direction of my hand, the piano, which was responsible for the arpeggio and accompaniment, struck the keys.

The importance of a conductor lies in controlling the tempo.

So, does that mean a metronome would suffice? Not at all. The direction of the melody also unfolded from the fingertips. It was as if the massive instrument's emotions were coming to life.

Starting with a lyrical introduction, the ripples on a tranquil lake continued.

The members, who had swallowed their tension, were now engrossed in their performance.

An immaculate symphony of notes. In the slow and singing melody of Andante Cantabile, the concertmaster's solo part began.

The posture and stance were perfect. The movement of the left hand pressing the strings was also beautiful. The elegant melody, as if bewitching, gave the signal and concluded.

At that moment,

Dududung—!

A powerful resonance, reminiscent of Tchaikovsky's Pathetique, struck the ears.

Beautiful flowers do not bloom easily. The hand slicing through the air grew sharper.

The eyes of the members, filled with tension and excitement, were brimming with joy. They all played their strings, watching my hand intently.

Like buds striving to bloom, the melodies raced to tickle the ears.

Zing.

The cello's profound resonance melted the frozen melody. As the finale approached, my heart pounded in sync with the movements of my hand.

It was an untitled score. It was just a piece I wrote while watching the vigorous sprouting of new buds.

As the finale drew near, the members' foreheads were drenched with sweat. They quickened their bows to match the final climax.

The members who met my gaze would know. They were following along very well.

As a conductor, I told the members with my hand to prepare for the final resonance.

As if waiting for it, a lively melody echoed.

The audience must have clenched their fists. And they would be surprised. Because at the end of this thrilling musical journey, there was a grand proclamation.

'Show everyone.'

At that moment, the signal from my hand slicing through the air led the concertmaster's bow, and the string section swiftly drew their bows.

Zing—!

An unbelievably smooth and refined resonance. The orchestra was saying it. That spring had finally arrived.
