In a university neighborhood in Seoul, it was still early evening, too early to start drinking, but the pub was already filled with students.

They were all wearing the same clothes as if they had made a pact. Students wearing varsity jackets from the Korean University German Department clinked their beer glasses amid boisterous laughter.

At that moment,

Ding-ding―!

A male student resembling a bear stood up, tapping his beer glass with a spoon.

"Attention, everyone! We've all gathered here to watch the broadcast featuring our pride, Kang Hyun, from the Korean University German Department. Let's all raise a toast for Kang Hyun, who is working hard as a judge in a distant foreign land!"

With Kim Daewoo's shout, the students all raised their beer glasses.

A terrestrial broadcast was already being projected onto the pub's spacious wall using a beam projector. As the long commercials ended and the 'Queen Elisabeth Competition' documentary began, everyone held their breath and watched the screen.

"It's starting now."

In another mansion of Chapelle, judges were gathered to watch the Queen Elisabeth Competition broadcast. Each of them was holding their favorite drink, whether it was vodka, whiskey, or a glass of wine.

As soon as Hugo finished speaking, the documentary's narration began.

[Today is the first day for the 12 young violinists staying at Chapelle to perform with the Belgian National Symphony Orchestra at the world-renowned Bozar Hall. Kang Hyun is participating as a judge, leading these 12 young violinists.]

The antique interior and the elaborate embossed patterns on the ceiling were as captivating as the constellations in the night sky.

Moreover, the spacious seats that could accommodate thousands of people gave an overwhelming feeling to the viewers.

It indeed seemed worthy of being called one of the world's top three concert halls, like Carnegie Hall and Concertgebouw. At that moment,

Thud-thud-thud―!

The majestic sound of a large drum resonated, surprising everyone with the grandeur of Bozar Hall. It was a performance by the Belgian Symphony Orchestra.

Although it was an unexpected performance, it was so mesmerizing that the 12 young violinists on the screen, as well as the viewers, held their breath and watched.

At the end of the grand symphony, Maestro Eden Simeon's figure appeared on camera.

[What did you all feel while listening to the symphony?]

What could this mean?

[Is there anyone who can identify the mistakes in the symphony that was just played?]

Everyone was taken aback. However, when Anna from Russia identified two mistakes, a murmur of admiration arose from the judges beyond the screen.

Even they couldn't confidently identify mistakes in a grand symphony at once. But the surprise didn't end there.

[Hyun, we can expect you to do the same, right?]

The camera alternated between focusing on Maestro Eden Simeon and Kang Hyun. The judges beyond the screen also looked at Kang Hyun with curious eyes.

Kang Hyun felt his throat dry up from the sudden attention. The camera director was capturing the scene so artistically that it could have been a movie shoot rather than a documentary.

Eventually, Kang Hyun on the screen chuckled lightly and began to speak.

[In the prelude of the first movement, the member playing the large drum had an unstable grip on the mallet. The member's fingertips holding the mallet were slightly relaxed. It's hard to see it as a simple mistake; it seemed like it was Maestro's intentional instruction.]

……!

[Also, when the horn was played using the gestop technique, the member's hand didn't completely cover the valve. Because of that, instead of a sharp metallic tone, a soft tone came out for a moment. It seemed like they intentionally left about a third of the hand-stopping space.]

Astonished gazes continued in the silence. The 12 young violinists on the screen, as well as the judges watching the documentary beyond the screen, were equally amazed.

[I won't mention the second and third movements since violinist Anna has already addressed them. Lastly, in the highlight part that marks the climax of the fourth movement, Maestro's conducting direction was off. However, the members played correctly, as if they had agreed in advance.]

As Kang Hyun on the screen chuckled and concluded, Hugo, the great maestro from France, opened his mouth wide in admiration while watching the documentary.

Hirose looked at Kang Hyun with a faint smile, as if she had expected it.

On the other hand, Viktor from Russia, who was drinking vodka, muttered to himself, "Unbelievable, really," while looking at Kang Hyun with a complicated expression.

* * *

"Did you really guess it right?"

Curiosity was evident in Hugo's wrinkled eyes. The other judges felt the same.

When Kang Hyun nodded briefly in response, admiration erupted from all around. The broadcast content had been that shocking.

Finding the mistakes in a grand epic symphony was no easy task. It required mastery of numerous instruments and conducting.

Moreover, the Kang Hyun in the video didn't even show a hint of uncertainty.

"When he was correcting the mistakes in the full score with a red pen, I thought it was one of those hidden camera pranks that are popular among young people these days."

"I felt the same. I understand now why Gustav praised Hyun so much. Deng Lun, weren't you also very surprised?"

"I experienced this once seven years ago. Back then, Hyun was just a boy whose height barely reached my waist. Do you know how shocked the judges were at that time? Even the stubborn Alexei couldn't keep his mouth shut."

Deng Lun had once said through the media that if Kang Hyun, from seven years ago, participated in the Queen Elisabeth Competition now, he would win.

Most people thought it was an exaggeration, but after watching today's broadcast, they all agreed. Even Eden Simeon had said that the young Kang Hyun had solved his mysteries seven years ago.

Kang Hyun was bombarded with endless questions, as if he were at a hearing. Even the usually reticent judges didn't hold back their questions for Kang Hyun.

Eventually, he received invitations from great maestros like Hugo from France and Deng Lun from China to visit their countries after the Queen Elisabeth Competition.

"Can I have a word with you?"

When Kang Hyun returned to his room after the hearing-like session, Viktor, who had been frowning until a moment ago, spoke to him.

Kang Hyun nodded and sat facing Viktor. Viktor hesitated for a moment, then sighed deeply and spoke.

"I apologize first, for calling you a novice."

Is the sun going to rise in the west tomorrow? Kang Hyun wondered if he had heard wrong, but looking into Viktor's eyes, he realized he was sincere.

Kang Hyun leaned forward and waved his hand, indicating that it was okay. After all, compared to Viktor's experience, Kang Hyun was just a drop in the ocean.

"I never believed in prodigies or geniuses. Probably, other musicians felt the same. But watching you, I can't deny that my values are changing."

Viktor handed a glass of vodka to Kang Hyun and continued the conversation.

The conversation continued until the full moon adorned the window. It was the first time Kang Hyun had talked so much with Viktor since coming to Brussels.

'He's easier to talk to than I thought.'

Kang Hyun had thought Viktor was just a stubborn old man. But here he was, admitting his mistake and apologizing to Kang Hyun.

After that, the two continued their serious discussion about music.

"Hyun, you really know a lot about music."

Viktor's drunken antics were surprisingly cute. His tongue shortened, and he kept smiling.

In the end, Viktor, who had been drinking vodka non-stop in his good mood, was the first to fall asleep. He had a broad smile on his face.

When Kang Hyun carried him to the bed, Viktor began to snore loudly.

"Guess I won't be able to sleep right away today."

Kang Hyun chuckled and covered the sleeping Viktor with a blanket.

Then he picked up his violin case and walked outside.

* * *

Anna couldn't sleep. She lay on her bed but couldn't easily fall asleep.

No wonder, with the stage less than two days away. Other participants must be feeling the same. Even when she closed her eyes, musical notes kept appearing in her mind.

Before she knew it, the full moon that had filled the night sky was gradually disappearing, and a pale light was appearing beyond the horizon.

"Sigh."

Anna eventually grabbed her coat and walked outside. The early morning breeze of Chapelle would naturally clear her thoughts.

Buzz.

At that moment, Anna unconsciously moved towards the melody that was piercing her ears.

It was a melody resonating from the forest beyond Chapelle's garden.

She hesitated for a moment but then, drawn by the melody, pushed through the bushes and moved forward as if enchanted.

The rustling leaves seemed to bow their heads as they watched Anna.

The long grass swayed like it was dancing in the early morning breeze.

The chirping of insects acted as an accompaniment, like the delicate sound of a harp.

Gulp.

Anna swallowed her saliva and continued walking. Along with the sound of the babbling brook, the owner of the melody appeared. However, the face was not clearly visible in the darkness.

Anna was captivated and became the sole audience without even thinking about identifying the violinist's face.

How much time had passed?

The dawn was breaking above the night sky that had been filled with the full moon.

Amid the mist spreading like sea fog, the violinist's face became clear.

But the surprise didn't end there. Along with the continuous melody in the forest, there was a distinct clicking sound like glass slippers.

Anna rubbed her eyes with her sleeve and looked ahead. Precisely, through the mist, she saw a mysterious light approaching the violinist.

Thump-thump-thump.

Anna felt her heart pounding. Soon, through the hazy mist, a clear horn appeared.

Anna's eyes widened. The being emerging with the dawn amid the twilight was a pure white deer.

How could this be?

Anna couldn't believe her eyes. The pure white deer seemed to emerge from the mist as if it had suddenly appeared in mid-air.

Thump-thump-thump.

A mysterious halo poured down with the melody. The pure white deer moved along with all the sounds as if it were the leader of the forest.

Anna felt an inexplicable sense of sanctity. Perhaps this was how those who encountered Christ in the past felt.

At that moment, the pure white deer rubbed its face as if greeting the violinist.

But the violinist, who was playing with his eyes closed, was completely unaware of this situation.

With the dawning light, a mysterious halo flowed over the violinist's body.

How much time had passed? In the dreamy space, Anna held her racing heart and closed her eyes. When she opened them again,

"Anna?"

The violinist playing alone in the forest, Kang Hyun, was approaching her.

Kang Hyun seemed surprised to see Anna kneeling among the bushes.

But Anna was more concerned with finding the pure white deer she had just seen. However, the pure white deer was nowhere to be seen.

Only the brilliant dawn was shining on Kang Hyun.
