“Whoa―!” 

Producer Kim Dohyun let out a pure expression of admiration. The footage from the documentary he encountered in the editing room was as good as a scene from a romance movie.

Kang Hyun's appearance, as proven during his performance at the British Royal Concert, was impeccable. Wasn't the whole of Korea buzzing with excitement at the appearance of the young maestro in a tailcoat several years ago?

“He is really handsome.”

It was no exaggeration to say that he blossomed like a flower bud. If he looked like a beautiful boy at the British Royal Concert, he now appeared as a fully grown beautiful young man.

His tall stature, broad shoulders, and eyes filled with melancholy, along with his perfectly sculpted nose, were enough to captivate countless women’s hearts.

It's no wonder he's called the idol of the classical music world.

“Sunbae, what are you doing here at this hour?”

“Can't you see? I'm editing.”

“Why are you doing it? It's unusual for you to stay late and work.”

A junior producer looked at Kim Dohyun with surprised eyes. It made sense because even within the current affairs and cultural team, Kim Dohyun was known for his cleverness.

Moreover, due to the nature of documentaries having less footage to edit than variety shows, he was one of the few people who would leave work around dinner time.

“Wow, is this Kang Hyun? He looks much more handsome in the video than in the pictures.”

“Don't even talk about it. Although he has such a delicate appearance, his charisma is no joke.”

“Charisma?”

‘Aura’ would be a more accurate term.

Everyone who met Kang Hyun in person said the same thing. Beyond his handsome looks, the depth felt in his gaze and speech was remarkable.

Kim Dohyun also agreed. Kang Hyun was an incredibly fascinating and mysterious person in real life.

Gulp.

At that moment, Producer Kim Dohyun swallowed hard. His eyes were glued to the monitor as if watching the highlight of a movie. The junior producer also found a seat and stared intensely at the monitor.

On the small screen, Kang Hyun was vividly captured conducting an orchestra. He even pinpointed the orchestra members' mistakes with precision.

Every scene featuring Kang Hyun was a masterpiece, making editing almost unnecessary.

Violin.

It was the first time a man looked so handsome holding an instrument.

The fluid continuity of his movements elicited simultaneous exclamations from the two producers.

Moreover, his stern correction of a violinist was endlessly charming to watch.

At that moment, both the junior producer and Kim Dohyun instinctively knew. Once aired, the show’s ratings were bound to explode.

Clack!

The black stone was placed on the Go board with a sharp sound.

“Where have all your skills gone?”

It had been a while since Chairman Wang and his opponent played Go. The face of the old fox lit up like a child’s. It seemed the game was going according to his plan.

It was then.

“That can't be.”

The white stone captured the black stone's large group, reversing the game in an instant. Chairman Wang's brow furrowed immediately.

Thanks to advanced software, the Go game was at a semi-pro level. For Chairman Wang, who learned Go from a national champion, it was hard to understand.

“You don't just eat and play Go, so how can you be this good?”

“It's natural talent. Grandfather, you've improved a lot too. At this rate, I might lose.”

“You little rascal, you shouldn't tease your grandfather. I think it would be quite interesting to match you against Jo teacher. If you win today, I'll arrange a match.”

He was referring to the top player in the Korean Go community.

On the other hand, curiosity sparked. How good was my Go skill? To compete with a top-ranked player called the War God was an honor for any Go player.

“Then I won't go easy anymore.”

“What?”

As soon as the black stone was placed, the white stone followed immediately.

Wasn’t it a body already specialized in reading sequences? Chairman Wang appeared flustered by the sudden speed but soon left his hand off the black stone as if resigning.

“You light up at the mention of Jo teacher's name.”

“Anyone who loves Go would want to meet him at least once.”

“You cheeky rascal, you never let your grandfather win.”

Chairman Wang smiled faintly despite his words. If he played Go half-heartedly, he would definitely get scolded instead.

“Lately, Manager Kim seems quite happy.”

“Manager Kim Sang-guk?”

“Yes, he's quite different from his time in the strategic planning department. Not only has he become gentler, but his thinking has also deepened. I wonder who’s responsible for that. Your grandfather wants to know the method too.”

It was an overpraise. It was only natural. Compared to Chairman Wang, who built the Jeil Group, I was just a novice.

“By the way, Yooha will be coming back to Korea soon.”

“Yooha?”

“Yes, she wants to study in Korea during her vacation instead of staying in the US. She also wants to attend your concert.”

The mention of Yooha returning to Korea made my heart race unknowingly.

“Why are your cheeks turning red?”

“Pardon?”

Red cheeks? That can't be. I hurriedly touched my cheek, and Chairman Wang looked at me with a mischievous expression. Ah, I've been had.

“Hyun, Judge Jung told me you are quite knowledgeable about law.”

Judge Jung?

Who could he be referring to?

“He’s a professor teaching law at Korea University. He’s a friend of your grandfather's, so we meet occasionally.”

“Professor Jung?”

“Yes, he said you have exceptional knowledge of law, even better than most law students. He even told me he wants to see you become a legal professional.”

I never expected that the old professor teaching law and Chairman Wang would know each other. No matter how gentle he appeared, Chairman Wang's reach was extensive.

However, in this life, I had no intention of pursuing a career in law, even if it meant facing the sword.

“Your grandfather has a legal question.”

If he had a legal question, he could ask the Jeil Group's legal team.

Among them were former Supreme Court justices and numerous top-notch attorneys.

As I took a sip of water, Chairman Wang asked an unexpected question.

“Can minors get engaged?”

I involuntarily spat out the water.

“The difference between Kang Hyun and Baek Junghoon?”

The Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra concertmaster's face looked conflicted. It seemed he didn't expect such a question from the filming team.

At that moment, Producer Kim Dohyun chimed in.

“Viewers don't have the chance to meet Kang Hyun or Baek Junghoon in person. They’d be curious about their personalities and stage presence. We’re interested in hearing from the orchestra members who face them regularly. If you prefer, we can keep your comments anonymous. Just speak as if you’re talking to a friend.”

The concertmaster seemed to ponder for a moment before he began.

“I'll start with Baek Junghoon. Offstage, we’re like brothers. Junghoon has made a name for himself as a pianist and often collaborated with the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra. As a pianist, Junghoon was like a noble crane.”

“A noble crane?”

“Yes, his performances were elegant and poised. His natural talent and hard work were beyond imagination. It's no wonder he was called a future maestro at such a young age in Korea. Many still remember and miss him as a pianist. However, as a conductor, he was unexpected.”

The producer leaned in, intrigued.

“He’s become sharply honed. I don't mean it in a bad way. His musical personality changed. Where he was once gentle, he’s now cold and precise. Honestly, I never imagined he’d be so talented as a conductor. I wondered how much effort it took to get to where he is in just a few years. Even if I were reborn, I couldn't achieve what he has.”

It was hard to believe such words came from the concertmaster of Korea’s leading orchestra.

The concertmaster continued with his thoughts on the next person.

“I haven't known Kang Hyun for long. I had heard of him, but seeing his performance and conducting left me speechless. You know, Kang Hyun is only twenty. But his skills and maturity are not just the result of talent. What can we do? I suppose ordinary musicians like me felt the same way watching legendary geniuses of the past. There's little difference between Kang Hyun on and off stage. Initially, even the principal members found him intimidating. His charisma and focus on stage are unmatched in Korea.”

“If you had to describe Kang Hyun in one sentence?”

“Hmm, no matter how much I think about it, there's only one phrase that fits.”

The concertmaster, recalling Kang Hyun’s face, spoke without hesitation.

“An unparalleled genius.”

“Are you filming today as well?”

I never imagined they’d film even on a school day. Luckily, the VJ was using a small 6mm camera instead of the large ones commonly seen in broadcasting stations.

The reason for visiting the school was simple. It was the day of the final exam before summer vacation.

“I hope everyone does their best until the end.”

With the professor's voice, the sound of exam papers being handed out echoed loudly. Somehow, the final exam happened to be for the law elective course.

The exam level was quite high, as I'd heard. Some questions were impossible for a first-year student to answer.

But that didn’t apply to me, so I diligently moved my pen.

As I filled the essay-type answer sheet with legal interpretations, I felt a strange sensation. The professor was behind me, smiling contentedly as he watched me. I should probably slow down a bit.

“Hyun, today’s the end of the semester. Are you coming to the class gathering?”

“Huh?”

“We’ve all gathered except for you. Don’t you think you should show your face at least once? By the way, who’s that person next to you?”

As soon as the exam ended, Kim Daewoo appeared. He soon noticed the small camera held by the VJ and exclaimed, “Broadcasting station?” loudly. His booming voice naturally drew the attention of those around us.

“Are you a friend of Kang Hyun?”

“Yes, yes. We’ve known each other since middle school.”

“If it’s not too much trouble, could you tell us about Kang Hyun’s popularity on campus?”

The VJ seized the opportunity to ask Kim Daewoo. Although momentarily nervous by the sudden camera appearance, Kim Daewoo soon displayed his characteristic cheerfulness.

“He’s incredibly popular. I'm the representative of the German Language Department’s first-year students, and there are so many requests from other departments and even women’s universities for group dates with Hyun.”

“Group dates?”

“Yes, but Hyun has never attended one.”

Then the VJ subtly added, glancing at me.

“Does Kang Hyun have a girlfriend?”

Kim Daewoo, who had been speaking well until now, suddenly closed his mouth and looked at me. The camera also turned towards me.

It became an unavoidable question. What should I say?

However, the deliberation didn't last long.

“Yes, I do.”
