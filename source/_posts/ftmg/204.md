The London Symphony Concert Hall is bustling. Despite it being a day without rehearsals, numerous members have gathered together.

The reason was simple. It was the day of guidance from the legendary maestro, Caras.

Although she had retired and many years had passed, her fame had only grown with each passing year.

Even prominent maestros had said they were in awe of her conducting.

Moreover, her proficiency in instrument guidance was widely recognized.

Even Maestro Spencer seemed unable to contain his curiosity as he took a seat in the audience early in the morning.

"Nice to meet you, everyone."

The members held their breath at the appearance of Caras. Her mere walk was full of elegance, and her serene gaze overflowed with charisma that overwhelmed the audience.

"I never expected so many of you would come out to receive guidance from me. Although I've been retired for a long time and still have many shortcomings as a conductor, I will do my best to help you all today."

The faces of the members were filled with excitement and anticipation. Indeed, receiving guidance from Caras was an incomparable honor for a musician.

For instance, there was a tale of a famous genius pianist, Carl Zeeman, who offered a large sum to receive guidance from Caras while she was reclusive in Austria, but was flatly rejected.

The sound of instruments playing different pieces reached the ceiling of the concert hall.

Since it was individual practice, it was understandable, but at first glance, it sounded like a cacophony, making it difficult to discern each instrument's sound.

Indeed, such a large number of people having individual practice in one place was unprecedented. However,

"Michael, your right-hand stick is shaking. Don't force yourself to get rid of habits that have become rigid over time. If you refine it and make it your own, there will be no lack."

Maestro Caras was catching every single melody of the individual instruments as if she had countless ears.

"Emanuel, the depth of your strings is good. But an overly rich tone is never a good thing. How about playing the strings like this?"

Starting with the principal cellist,

"The concertmaster is showing flawless performance."

"You flatter me."

"But how about playing like this in the beginning?"

Up to Concertmaster Dmitri. Caras was guiding every member's performance like a ghost.

The eyes of the members, filled with excitement and anticipation, began to show signs of disbelief and tension.

The members commonly thought as they received guidance from Caras. As if,

They were receiving guidance from Hyun.

Beep beep beep beep.

The sound of a machine indicating vital signs, the parameters connecting to life, filled the bedroom.

Chairman Wang was lying on the sickbed as if in a deep sleep. An old man with white hair tied in a ponytail looked down at Chairman Wang with piercing eyes.

"When will you stop sleeping, you rascal."

The old man's voice was filled with bitterness.

"The tiger cub has finally shown its claws. What shall I do?"

"Sir, may I ask you a question?"

"A question?"

"Yes, are you really Teacher Deoksoo?"

The old man's eyes narrowed like a flatfish and scrutinized me as if searching for lice.

It was a different kind of seasoned gaze compared to Kim Namcheon. It felt as if he was reading my mind.

"I told you, I abandoned the name Teacher Deoksoo a long time ago. Now I'm just an old nameless man. It has been almost fifty years since I first met Songa. But to think the disciple would try to go before the teacher."

"Chairman Son told me to find Teacher Deoksoo."

"Me?"

Teacher Deoksoo looked at me with puzzled eyes.

"What will you do with a nameless old man?"

"Sorry?"

"Do I look like I have strength or power to you?"

The old man had a robust build like a wrestling champion, but he seemed far from power. His attire and hair made him look like a hermit from the mountains. At that moment,

"Even so, I can't ignore the fact that a disciple desperately searched for his teacher. Songa was quick to learn from a young age. He was skilled in application, so if you taught him one thing, he understood ten. But to think he would be bedridden after being backstabbed by his own child."

"Backstabbed by his child?"

"You act as if you know everything but pretend not to. Songa must have anticipated this and taken precautions."

Precautions?

What could it mean? But Teacher Deoksoo showed no sign of explaining.

Teacher Deoksoo looked at the bedridden Chairman Wang with a fond gaze and then turned his head towards me.

"Let's go."

"Where are we going?"

"Staying here won't make the bedridden disciple suddenly get up. It's best to handle it quickly. That way, the disciple will also regain his strength. It's said that a fox acts like a king in the absence of a tiger. It's exactly like that. The tiger cub stepping on its own father. As a teacher, there's only one thing I can do."

Teacher Deoksoo's eyes gleamed.

"We're going tiger hunting."

* * *

"Damn it."

Son Kangwook's face turned red and blue like an angry tiger. It was because of the warning given to him by Lawyer Wang.

Just when everything was within reach, it was ruined. He never imagined his father would transfer shares to a third party.

"We've arrived, sir."

At the secretary's words, Son Kangwook lifted his head. Outside the car window, the view of Seoul Detention Center unfolded.

"It's been a while, hyung!"

Son Kangwook stood up with a forced smile. Son Ilsung, dressed in pretrial detention clothes, had entered the meeting room.

There was no sign of any emotional fluctuation on Son Ilsung's face.

"You look surprisingly good in pretrial detention clothes. I think prison clothes will suit you well too. How's life in the detention center?"

"Not too bad."

"You are the elite of the elites. Even the head of the detention center is wary of you. I’m sure you’ll live comfortably even after being transferred to Seoul Southern Correctional Institution. The warden there is also quite wary of you, and as your only brother, I will send you plenty of provisions. Hasn't Hongwon come to visit you even once? Hahaha."

Despite the clear provocation, there was no change in Son Ilsung's eyes. He was as calm as a seasoned monk. It was Son Kangwook who ended up licking his dry lips.

The spacious meeting room had no guards or lawyers. Only Son Kangwook and Son Ilsung were facing each other.

"Hyung, let me be straightforward. At this rate, Jeil Group will be in my hands. I believe you know what I plan to do with Jeil Group."

"You'll tear it apart and sell it to foreign capital. You have no affection for Jeil Group. You must have realized that holding onto it for too long could be poisonous."

"That's why I fear you, hyung. You see through everything even from the detention center. If you agree to give up management rights and shares of Jeil Electronics and Jeil Trading Co., I will no longer touch Jeil Group. I can't tarnish father's sacred legacy any further."

"Jeil Electronics and Jeil Trading Co. are the heart of Jeil Group. It sounds like you want everything."

Son Ilsung replied leisurely.

"Hyung, you don't have many options."

"Why do you think I don’t have many options?"

"Hyung, bluffing doesn't work anymore. Even father is an old tiger with no teeth. What else could be left? No matter what you do here, Jeil Group is already in my grasp. You should give up."

At that moment, Son Ilsung burst into hearty laughter. His laughter was so loud that the meeting room echoed.

How much time had passed? Suddenly, Son Ilsung's eyes gleamed fiercely. So fierce that even Son Kangwook, who resembled a tiger, swallowed his saliva.

"Kangwook, I've never liked you. It's because you're so different inside and outside. I had more affection for the third, Hongwon, who grew up as a troublemaker. But not for you."

"Isn't that mutual?"

"You know one thing but not the other. Father, an old tiger? Do you think the founder of Jeil Group is that easy to deal with? Do you think I'm sitting here in pretrial detention clothes because I can't do anything?"

Is it a bluff? But Son Ilsung's eyes gleamed so fiercely that he seemed ready to devour Son Kangwook.

Son Ilsung stood up and spoke firmly.

"Do as you wish."

"What?"

"Let's see how far a trapped beast can go—!"

Leaving the bewildered Son Kangwook behind, Son Ilsung walked away, laughing heartily.

* * *

"You're said to be good at playing the violin?"

Teacher Deoksoo looked at me with curious eyes.

"I'm not that good."

"Nonsense. I don't watch much TV, but I know your face well. If you've won awards at international competitions, you're good. Modesty is not a virtue. And Songa boasted about you so much. I almost mistook you for his grandchild."

"Chairman Son?"

Teacher Deoksoo, sitting in the passenger seat, looked at my face intently. His gaze was so intense that it felt like the sunlight in midsummer.

"From a physiognomic perspective, you have talent in business. But you've blossomed artistically, so having too much talent is a problem. If you had talent only in business, I could have taken you as my last disciple and made you my masterpiece."

"Sir, is Gwangyang Baek Whale also your disciple?"

"Baek Whale? He was expelled for being cunning while receiving my teachings. He was obsessed with money and devoted his life to it. I made him live under my name for twenty years as punishment. That should be enough. He must have had a hard time with the scoundrels looking for Teacher Deoksoo for twenty years. How could a money-loving guy suddenly disappear from the stock market? It must have been tough. Haha."

The car was heading towards Jeil Group's headquarters. Teacher Deoksoo abruptly told me to drive to the headquarters. I ended up playing the role of a driver.

"Sir, why are we heading to Jeil Group's headquarters? Nothing will be resolved by us going there now."

"Haha, your disciple said you could predict the moves on a Go board as well as a national player, but you have no sense. Songa knew this would happen years ago. Kangwook was rotten to the core. And he's as good at hiding his true intentions as a snake disguised as a tiger."

At that moment, the car arrived at Jeil Group's headquarters.

Teacher Deoksoo walked briskly into the lobby. I ended up following him.

"How can I help you?"

The security guard in the lobby blocked Teacher Deoksoo. Although his eyes were sharp, his white hair and hermit-like appearance made him look like a mountain sage.

At that moment,

"I came to my company. Do I need a reason?"

"Excuse me?"

"Which floor is the chairman’s office?"

What on earth is going on? As the security guard narrowed his eyes and approached Teacher Deoksoo, elderly executives ran out from beyond the lobby.

I recognized them. They were the senior executives who assisted Chairman Wang. Even Son Ilsung, the president, couldn't treat them carelessly.

At that moment, the leading executive bowed respectfully to Teacher Deoksoo.

"Welcome, Chairman."
