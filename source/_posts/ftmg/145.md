‘Play it once?’

Baek Junghoon looked down at the sheet music in his hand.

Kang Hyun had taken the time to write down the score amidst his busy recording schedule.

It was as if the notes were a spontaneous outpouring of inspiration, written down in a single stroke.

He mentioned that the piece was still incomplete. The heart-pounding sensation from the sheet music without a fermata on the double bar line was unexpected.

Dooong.

His long fingers carefully pressed the keys. Unlike the classical pieces he usually played, Baek Junghoon repeatedly hummed the unfamiliar notes in his head.

He wondered what thoughts Kang Hyun had when he wrote these notes.

The sheet music was packed with notes that seemed unwilling to yield their positions.

Just looking at it, it felt like his fingertips were tingling, reminiscent of Liszt's sheet music.

Taking a deep breath, his fingers began to move like springs.

His right foot continuously moved on the pedal. It was a relentless series of fortes, as if his fingers were about to break.

Switching to a delicate play amidst a storm of thunders and lightning, Baek Junghoon bit the inside of his cheek to avoid missing the timing.

A grand and heavy melody, reminiscent of Schubert's "Erlkönig," continued for a while.

From the shiver that started at his shoulders and returned to pianissimo at his fingertips, Baek Junghoon visualized numerous images in response to the constant changes in musical ideas.

Even though his heart, still pounding, told him not to stop playing, there were no more notes on the staff.

‘Why didn’t he finish it?’

He couldn't understand. Usually, composers complete their sheet music in one sitting.

Of course, there were cases of repeated revisions, but it was rare to leave an ending so unresolved.

Perhaps Kang Hyun didn't want this piece to end. Musical ideas, like the wind, are fleeting and can disappear in an instant.

It was then.

“Junghoon, what piece was that just now?”

“Oh, director. It’s a piece Hyun was composing. It’s still incomplete.”

“I’ve never heard such a piece, like a plot-twist movie. The feeling of the piece kept changing so constantly that I thought you were playing multiple pieces in a row. The grand parts especially reminded me of the movie 'The Godfather.'”

Im Hyera's comment was spot on. The musical ideas kept twisting like a plot-twist movie. On the other hand, it also felt like a perfect fit for a movie OST.

When Kang Hyun handed him the sheet music, he left a curious remark.

“Why didn’t Hyun finish the sheet music? He’s usually a perfectionist who doesn't move until he completes it.”

“He said the musical idea hasn’t ended yet.”

“Musical idea?”

Kang Hyun often visualized a specific person when composing.

Baek Junghoon knew this and was curious. Who was this grand, stormy, sharp, and twist-filled person?

Doodoodoodoong—!

It was as if thunder struck a clear sky. Not only his uncles but also his aunts were all aghast, looking like they had seen a ghost.

It was natural to be surprised. This morning, his grandfather, who had been bedridden, was now up and scolding so harshly!

At that moment, his eldest uncle, who had been sitting at the head seat, hurriedly stood up.

“F-Father!”

Anyone would think he had taken acting classes. Tears as big as chicken droppings started to fall from his sly eyes.

Yet, his grandfather's glaring eyes showed no sign of softening. He just silently glared at his uncles and aunts.

“I heard everything while I was bedridden. Beomjin, you said you would take the chairman’s seat?”

“F-Father, it’s not that. There’s no one to manage Dongju right now. If the eldest doesn’t step up, who will?”

“Enough!”

At his grandfather’s roar, his aunt hiccupped. His grandfather sat in the empty head seat and scrutinized each of his children.

His younger uncle was visibly uneasy. It was natural, considering he was the one who had caused his grandfather to collapse and had been plotting all sorts of schemes. Just sitting there made him feel choked.

“Beomjin, Beomkyung.”

His grandfather called the two of them softly but with such a fierce look that it made them sweat coldly. The uncles straightened their backs, filled with tension.

“Beomjin, I heard you formed another new material development team while I was bedridden?”

“Since Kang’s commercialization of graphene kept failing and getting delayed, I took charge of the new material development department. The new researchers are trustworthy talents, unlike the Russians. Father.”

“Trustworthy talents?”

His grandfather gave a peculiar smile as he looked at his eldest uncle.

“Beomjin, do you know how Dongju Chemical came this far?”

“Father, as the executive director, I know the company’s history.”

“Then let me ask you. Recite the manufacturing process of Donghwa detergent. I believe I asked you this before as well?”

He hadn’t expected his grandfather to repeat a question from years ago. Both the younger and the elder uncle were at a loss for words, their lips twitching.

They were indeed fools. It was no wonder that Dongju had been absorbed by foreign capital in their past life.

“I’ve repeatedly told you. If you don’t handle things properly, I’ll entrust Dongju to a professional manager. But seeing your behavior today, it seems neither of you is fit to be a manager. One of you committed all sorts of atrocities while exiled, and the other is doing unworthy things out of greed.”

“F-Father, that’s not it. I will develop a new material that will truly elevate Dongju Chemical. Please trust me just once.”

“Trust you?”

It was a story even a passing dog wouldn’t believe, but the eldest uncle’s tear-streaked face looked earnest. It seemed he had indeed taken acting classes without anyone knowing.

“If the commercialization of graphene fails and my new material development finishes first, wouldn’t you agree that my choice was correct, Father?”

“What if the opposite happens? If the new material development you trust so much goes down the drain, will you give up any lingering desire for the chairman’s seat?”

The eldest uncle seemed quite confident in his words.

His grandfather, too, seemed to have an idea as he nodded briefly. Given his meticulous nature, this bet wouldn’t end with just verbal agreements.

“Everyone, leave. Beomkyung, you stay.”

His grandfather’s fierce eyes fixed on his younger uncle. It felt like he could already hear his uncle’s forehead bursting.

“Chairman Yoo has risen?”

The teacup made a cheerful sound as it was placed down.

“I should hear the details from Hyun. It’s a pity I couldn’t witness the scene myself.”

Chairman Wang’s wrinkled eyes were filled with genuine regret.

He had not missed his close friend’s theatrics against his children.

He couldn’t imagine the looks of shock on the faces of those children as they faced the truth of the plot-twist movie.

At that moment, Kang Hyun entered the reception room.

“Hyun, you seem to be quite the gentleman. You’ve come to see your grandfather just when he was curious.”

Kang Hyun knew why Chairman Wang had called him. Chairman Yoo was busy with company affairs, so Kang Hyun, who was at the scene, was the best person to hear the details from.

How much time had passed? Chairman Wang, listening to Kang Hyun recount the events of the previous evening, clapped his hands together like he had just seen a movie highlight.

“Honestly, I didn’t think Grandfather would wake up so soon. I thought he might take more time.”

At that moment, Chairman Wang’s eyes shone like those of a Sphinx giving a riddle.

“Hyun, do you know how your grandfather and I met?”

“How did you meet?”

“After the war, I came down from Hamgyeongbuk-do and started a business in Seoul. Your grandfather, born into a wealthy family in Chungcheong-do and starting a business in Seoul, and I first met in prison. Back then, we weren’t big shots, just nobodies. We were jailed because we didn’t want to pay local taxes. We had a scuffle with some local thugs. At the time, we had to pay not only the government but also the thugs. The thugs called it legitimate tax and named it local tax.”

Kang Hyun’s ears perked up. He had never heard about his grandfather’s younger days. Chairman Wang continued, reminiscing about the past.

“One day, your grandfather told me he had found a way to deal with the thugs who came to the factory almost daily to cause trouble.”

“A way to deal with them?”

“Yes, and soon enough, the thugs were eradicated as if by magic. Your grandfather, who seemed stubborn and blunt, had lobbied the political circles. Do you know how shocked I was when I found out? No one would have thought that a headstrong man like him would use such a method.”

Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo surviving through tumultuous times wasn’t a mere coincidence. They not only had bold dispositions but also a strong and flexible nature.

“Hyun, you just told me you were curious why your grandfather ended his act and got up.”

“Yes.”

“If you think about it in reverse, there’s a simple answer, isn’t there?”

Kang Hyun still didn’t understand. He hadn’t met his younger uncle separately yet. But Chairman Wang, lifting his teacup, added.

“It must be because there was no longer a need to drag it out.”

* * *

It was a night bathed in blue moonlight. His grandfather was gazing at the small pond flowing in the garden.

His wrinkled eyes seemed filled with unspeakable worries. It was only natural, given he had witnessed all the disgraceful acts of his children while bedridden.

“Grandfather.”

At times like this, being silently by his side could be a comfort. His grandfather, without a word, gazed at the moonlit pond for a long time before speaking.

“Hyun, do you see the big carp in there?”

“The one with golden spots?”

“Yes, that one. It’s the biggest in this pond. But it’s actually the lowest in the hierarchy.”

It was the first time he knew there was a hierarchy among carps. Indeed, the large golden carp seemed to have a smaller territory compared to the others.

His grandfather continued as if telling an interesting story.

“The problem is it got greedy and ate too much. People think carps are mindless, but they’re not. They instinctively wait for the bigger ones to become sluggish. When they see an opening, they seize it. Even gentle carps have such instincts, so imagine how it is for others.”

His grandfather seemed deep in thought as he watched the golden carp with its torn tail.

There were many things he wanted to ask, but he couldn’t break the silence.

After some time, his grandfather broke the silence first.

“Your younger uncle and aunt are going to transfer their shares.”

“What?”

“Why are you so surprised? Didn’t you know that VH Company’s ownership includes your grandfather? I don’t know what you told them, but they clung to the offer even though it was much lower than originally suggested.”

His grandfather had been handling matters even while bedridden. The surprises didn’t end there.

“Beomjin. That kid has always been full of bravado. I let it slide because I thought a man should have some bravado to grow into a bigger person. Who knew his bravado would grow and not his character? Dr. Tikhonov reports to me regularly. On the surface, it seems the commercialization of graphene is failing, but in reality, it's progressing steadily.”

There was a reason why his grandfather had made a bet with his eldest uncle. But his cautious nature meant he had more than one plan.

“Hyun, did your eldest uncle bring a new doctor?”

“Yes, I heard he’s a Korean-American.”

“His name was Andrew Song.”

“Grandfather, have you met him already?”

His grandfather had gone straight to Dongju after recovering, so he must have already checked the new material development department his eldest uncle was in charge of.

He was curious. This was a move he had never heard of in his past life.

As the wind shook the moonlight on the water’s surface...

“Of course, I know.”

“What?”

“It was me who called Andrew to Korea.”

As the moon on the water regained its full shape, the final musical idea was complete.
