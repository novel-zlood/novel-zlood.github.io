Debussy's Arabesque came to mind. Its dreamy and mysterious tone made it feel like I was in a dream.

Even now, it was the same. Who would have thought that the legendary maestro, Karas, would visit the mansion in Ichon-dong?

“Madam, I am overwhelmed by your warm welcome.”

Karas's face was filled with deep emotion.

Despite the sudden visit, my mother and father welcomed him with open arms. My grandfather did the same. Even those who were not familiar with classical music knew how famous Karas was.

Indeed, in 1983, the then-president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, referred to Karas's conducting as the work of a celestial maestro.

“We didn't know we would have a guest, so we haven't prepared much. It's a bit embarrassing that there isn't much on the table, but please enjoy. Thank you so much for thinking highly of our son.”

As the interpreter, I looked at my mother curiously. There was a feast laid out on the table, and yet she said there was nothing prepared. The common saying "the table legs will break" perfectly described the situation.

“This is more exquisite than when I visited the White House and the Kremlin. The effort Madam has put into the decoration of these dishes is evident. It seems Hyun has inherited Madam's meticulous nature.”

He must be referring to the United States and Russia. Karas was tasting each dish on the table without missing a single one.

I thought he wouldn't be able to use chopsticks, but he was quite adept. He could pick up beans as well as any average Asian.

“Hyun seems to resemble his grandfather a lot. The aura they exude and even their eyes are similar. His handsome features are the same too. Especially, his grandfather looks like a Hollywood movie star.”

They say compliments can make even a whale dance. Even my usually calm and composed grandfather showed a faint smile at the comparison to a Hollywood movie star.

“Thank you for such a compliment, maestro. To be honest, you could even be a movie star yourself.”

“You're just saying that to make me feel good, right? I'll take it gratefully, Hyun.”

Time may have passed, but the maestro's beautiful appearance had not faded. In fact, his noble and elegant beauty seemed to have even deepened.

Even in his youth, he was so exceptionally handsome that he could be compared to any actress, so it was only natural.

Though his face now had wrinkles and his hair had turned gray, his aura was something not easily dared to challenge.

At that moment,

“Hyun, aren't you going to introduce the lovely young lady who came with me?”

Oh, I hadn't introduced Yooha yet, had I? It was understandable, given the sudden appearance of the maestro had thrown the house into chaos.

Just as Yooha was about to introduce herself, the maestro spoke first.

“Is she perhaps Hyun's fiancée?”

* * *

Karas thought that Kang Hyun and Son Yooha matched very well. It wasn't just because of their appearance.

Living for a long time gives you a certain intuition, and the way they looked at each other seemed filled with a kind of melancholy.

“Hyun, may I look at your scores?”

“Of course, maestro.”

Thanks to Hyun's consideration, Karas had a chance to look at the scores. He sat on Hyun's bedside and opened the scorebook.

It was a feast of numerous musical ideas. Each note on the staff brought to mind Handel, Tchaikovsky, and even Mozart and Dvořák.

It was hard to fathom how a person could do this.

“Hyun, you have an incredible talent for composing.”

“You flatter me, maestro.”

“No, it's truly amazing.”

Composers create their own world through a bit of inspiration. Karas, having conducted for a long time, was not ignorant of the profound world of composition.

Yet, Hyun's scores were like Russian dolls.

People who make a living through creation usually have a distinct style.

But looking at Hyun's scores, it felt like numerous colors were blended together.

It was no wonder that names of composers with different styles came to mind.

“Hyun, how long have you been composing?”

“It's been less than five years, maestro.”

“So, all these pieces were composed in less than five years?”

It was unbelievable. But what followed was even more astonishing.

“Yes, maestro. There are more scores in my studio. I haven't counted them all because there are too many, including unfinished pieces.”

A sigh of admiration escaped Karas. It must be what it felt like to see Mozart, who left numerous concertos, symphonies, and operas. The thick scorebook was filled with notes.

Karas stared at the scores intently for a long time before standing up. Her wrinkled eyes were filled with excitement.

Indeed, looking at Hyun's symphony made her want to conduct it right away. At that moment,

“A violin?”

It was a practice violin. It wasn't the Stradivarius or Guarneri known to be Hyun's instruments, but it was well-maintained.

“It belonged to my mother. I use this violin when I play alone at home sometimes.”

“Hyun, if it's not too much trouble, could I hear you play a piece? I haven't seen you as a violinist in person.”

“Of course, it would be an honor if you listened to my performance, maestro.”

He took out the practice violin from the old case. The condition of the bridge, the strings, and the bow, all maintained with rosin, were impeccable.

Hyun positioned himself smoothly, as if he was one with the instrument. The violin rested on his shoulder as if it was part of his body.

Zing.

It was a simple but warm resonance from the friction of the strings and the bow, without any flashy techniques.

Karas gently closed her eyes. Would it feel like this to walk on clouds? As the melody continued, it felt as if her whole body was becoming relaxed.

Karas knew countless violin pieces, but this was a continuous sequence of a style and structure she was hearing for the first time.

Karas's lips curled into a smile. She now knew what piece it was. Wasn't it the symphony she had been looking at intently just a moment ago?

Had he prepared it in advance? Or had he arranged it on the spot?

If it was the latter, then Hyun possessed an incredible talent that even Karas found hard to fathom.

When the performance ended, Karas slowly opened her half-closed eyes. The sight of Hyun with the violin on his shoulder and the bow tip gently touching the ground was like a painting.

Without hesitation, Karas spoke to Hyun.

“Hyun, would you like to learn music from me?”

* * *

“Ahem.”

A displeased cough filled the room.

“Still?”

“I'm sorry, Chairman.”

The frown on Chairman Kim Seongrak of Dongshin Group deepened.

The reason for his emotional change wasn't just business. It was because of Kang Hyun, who was currently causing a stir in Korea, that he was so interested.

Although their first impression of each other wasn't very pleasant, that could be changed.

“Is he not answering the phone at all?”

“Yes, Chairman. We are trying to arrange a meeting with the young lady by any means, but it's not easy. Not only does Kang Hyun's side refuse matchmaking, but they don't accept it at all.”

Despite being with his superiors, that arrogant expression. Initially, he thought Hyun was just an arrogant kid.

But after the incident at Seungjeongwon, Kim's perspective on Hyun had changed. The kid who seemed endlessly arrogant had become a top-grade diamond shining brighter than any other jewel. It was like he had fallen head over heels.

“Secretary Choi, tell me. Is our Hyein lacking in looks or intelligence compared to daughters of other families?”

“No, Chairman. Miss Hyein is an excellent candidate in both appearance and intelligence.”

Of course, his daughter, who was studying at a prestigious Ivy League school abroad, was on a different level from those who chose to study abroad as an escape.

And how was her appearance? She had inherited the features of Kim Seongrak's wife, a famous actress in Korea, making her facial features excellent.

Yet Hyun was like an impregnable fortress, not budging at all.

“Did you say that other groups are also pursuing this?”

“Yes, Chairman. All the companies among the top five, except for the Jeil Group, have approached Hyun. Even among the top ten companies, many are trying to contact Hyun.”

“Those hyena-like bastards, they have an impeccable sense of smell.”

Naturally, if there was an unmarried daughter in a major conglomerate family, Hyun would be a highly desirable son-in-law.

Especially, the heads of the top five conglomerates were extremely impressed by Hyun at Seungjeongwon.

But the problem was that Hyun still wasn't showing any signs of interest.

“That kid, his confidence remains unshaken. Keep pushing. If it doesn't work out, arrange a coincidental meeting with Hyein. There's no way I can let Son steal him.”

It was already well-known in the business world that Hyun had Jeil Group backing him.

But Kim Seongrak couldn't give up on Hyun. Not only because of VH Company but also because Hyun's appearance as a conductor at the concert had an irresistible charm that seemed to enchant people.

Surely, he would shine even more if kept close.

* * *

Why does the back of my head itch? Is someone talking about me?

I sat in my studio, endlessly staring at the scores. But the notes on the staff didn't catch my eye at all.

Who would have thought that Empress Karas of Austria would make such a proposal?

“Empress Karas.”

She was a legendary maestro I had never encountered in my previous life.

When I first took an interest in classical music, Karas had never appeared in public, let alone conducted.

Many musicians had said they would choose to listen to Karas's conducting if they could hear only one performance before they died.

“Hyun, can we talk for a moment?”

At that moment, Director Im Hyera visited the studio.

“EMA seems to want to release the live recording of the concert you and Mr. Junghoon conducted.”

“The live recording of the concert?”

“Yes, given the initial sales of your second album, there is significant global demand for this concert's live recording. We've already received many inquiries from your fans and Mr. Junghoon's fans. It's worth considering positively. And about the concert hosted by Gramophone, have you thought about it?”

It suddenly felt like even two bodies wouldn't be enough. In my previous life, I had worked tirelessly, chasing power and greed.

But in this life, even though I tried to maintain a peaceful and contented life, those around me wouldn't let me be. At that moment,

“By the way, Mr. Kim Sang-guk contacted me saying he needs to see you. He said he couldn't reach you, so he would come directly to the gallery.”

Oh no, I had been so preoccupied that I hadn't even received Mr. Kim's calls.

Not long after Director Im Hyera left the studio, Mr. Kim Sang-guk arrived. His sharp jawline and piercing eyes were the same as ever.

“CEO―!”

In the past, Mr. Kim Sang-guk would have shouted "Junior―!" But now, he called me CEO, smiling brightly.

I wondered if this person had ever smiled so brightly.

“We hit the jackpot!”

“The jackpot?”

“Do you remember the investment in the Austrian Calvin Pharmaceutical Company?”

I barely remembered. Most of the investment blueprint consisted of IT companies I knew from my previous life, but there were also companies in fields I wasn't familiar with.

I had chosen them based solely on their financial statements and growth potential. One of them was the pharmaceutical company.

“They have successfully developed a new cancer treatment drug!”

Well, they say "Fortune favors the bold".

From the Empress Karas of Austria to unexpected good fortune, it was a moment of continuous unexpected luck.
