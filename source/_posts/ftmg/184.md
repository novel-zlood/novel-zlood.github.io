Debussy's "Arabesque" came to mind. The dreamy and mysterious tone made me feel as if I were dreaming.

It was the same now. Who would have thought that the maestro Caras, known as the legend, would visit the mansion in Ichon-dong?

“Madam, I don't know how to express my gratitude for such a warm welcome.”

Caras's face was filled with deep emotion.

Despite the sudden visit, my mother and father welcomed him with open arms. Grandfather did the same. Even those unfamiliar with classical music knew how famous a maestro Caras was.

Indeed, even Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States in 1983, referred to Caras's conducting as heavenly. How could it be any different?

“We didn’t know we would have a guest, so we didn’t do any special shopping. There isn’t much prepared, but please eat a lot. Thank you so much for thinking highly of our son.”

As the interpreter, I looked at my mother in puzzlement. Despite her words, the table was laden with a feast. The common saying "the table legs are about to break" perfectly described the scene.

“The food here is more exquisite than anything I had at the White House or the Kremlin. It's evident how much care Madam has put into the decoration of these dishes. It seems Hyun has inherited Madam's meticulous nature.”

He must be referring to America and Russia. Caras was tasting every single dish on the table.

I thought he wouldn’t know how to use chopsticks, but he was quite adept. He could pick up beans in one go, almost as skillfully as an average Asian.

“Hyun seems to resemble his grandfather a lot. The look in his eyes and the aura he exudes are quite similar. His handsome appearance too. Especially, his grandfather would not be out of place as a Hollywood actor.”

As they say, compliments can make even a whale dance. Even my usually stoic grandfather showed a faint smile at the comparison to a Hollywood actor.

“Thank you, Maestro, for such compliments. Honestly, you would make a great actor yourself.”

“You’re saying that to make me feel good, right? I’ll take it gratefully, Hyun.”

Though time had passed, the maestro’s beautiful appearance hadn’t faded. Rather, it had become more noble and elegant.

Even in youth, Caras was known for being exceptionally attractive, comparable to many actresses, so it was only natural.

Although his face now had wrinkles and his hair had turned gray, the aura he exuded was still unapproachable.

It was then.

“Hyun, aren't you going to introduce the lovely young lady who came with me?”

Oh no, I hadn’t yet introduced Yooha. But then again, the sudden appearance of the maestro had thrown the house into chaos.

Just as Yooha was about to introduce herself, the maestro spoke first.

“Is she Hyun’s fiancée?”

* * *

Caras thought Kang Hyun and Son Yooha were a perfect match. It wasn’t just their outward appearance.

Having lived a long life, Caras had developed a sense for these things, and the way they looked at each other seemed tinged with melancholy.

“Hyun, may I look at your sheet music?”

“Of course, Maestro.”

Thanks to Kang Hyun's consideration, Caras was able to glance at his sheet music. Caras sat on the edge of Kang Hyun’s bed and opened the music book.

It was a feast of musical ideas. Each note on the staff brought to mind Handel, Tchaikovsky, Mozart, and Dvořák.

It was hard to fathom how a person could achieve this.

“Hyun, you truly have an exceptional talent for composing.”

“You flatter me, Maestro.”

“No, it’s truly amazing.”

A composer builds their own world through a spark of inspiration. Caras, having conducted for a long time, was not unfamiliar with the profound world of composition.

Even so, Kang Hyun’s sheet music was like a Russian nesting doll.

Creators often develop their own unique style.

But looking at Kang Hyun’s sheet music, it felt like a blend of various colors.

Thus, it was only natural for the names of composers with different styles to come to mind.

“Hyun, how long have you been composing?”

“Not yet five years, Maestro.”

“Then all these pieces were composed within five years?”

It was hard to believe. But what followed was even more surprising.

“Yes, Maestro. There are more scores in my studio. I haven’t counted them because there are too many, including unfinished pieces.”

A sigh of admiration escaped Caras's lips. It felt similar to looking at Mozart’s numerous concertos, symphonies, and operas. The thick music book was filled with notes.

Caras stood up after gazing at the sheet music for a long time. Her wrinkled eyes were filled with excitement.

It was no wonder, as looking at Kang Hyun’s symphony made her want to conduct it immediately. It was then.

“A violin?”

It was a practice violin. Although it wasn’t Kang Hyun’s Stradivarius or Guarneri, it was well-maintained.

“It belonged to my mother. I use it when I play alone at home.”

“Hyun, if it's not too much trouble, may I hear a piece? I’ve never seen you play as a violinist.”

“Of course, it would be an honor for you to hear my performance, Maestro.”

He took out the practice violin from the old violin case. The bridge, strings, and bow were well-maintained with rosin.

Kang Hyun took a position as naturally as flowing water. The violin was placed on his shoulder as if it were part of his body.

Ziiing.

It was a simple but warm resonance, without any flashy techniques, just the friction between the strings and the bow.

Caras closed her eyes gently. Walking on clouds might feel like this. The longer the melody continued, the more it felt like her whole body was relaxing.

Though Caras knew many violin pieces, the sequence and structure of this one were new to her.

A smile crept up on Caras’s lips. She finally realized what piece it was. It was the symphony she had just been looking at.

Had he prepared this in advance? Or had he arranged it on the spot?

If it was the latter, Kang Hyun possessed such immense talent that even Caras found it hard to fathom.

When the performance ended, Caras slowly opened her eyes. Kang Hyun, with the violin on his shoulder and the bow gently pointed down, looked like a painting.

Without hesitation, Caras spoke to Hyun.

“Hyun, would you like to learn music from me?”

* * *

“Cough.”

A clearly displeased cough filled the room.

“Still?”

“I’m sorry, Chairman.”

The frown on Chairman Kim Seongrak of Dongshin Group deepened.

The reason for his change in mood wasn’t solely business. Kang Hyun, who was shaking up South Korea, was his main concern these days.

Although their first impression of each other wasn’t pleasant, that could be changed.

“Is he still not answering the phone?”

“Yes, Chairman. We are trying everything to arrange a meeting with him and the young lady, but it’s not easy. It seems that neither Kang Hyun nor his side is accepting matchmaking at all.”

Despite being with elders, he had such an arrogant expression. Initially, he thought of him as a cheeky kid.

But after the incident at Seungjeongwon, his view of Kang Hyun changed. The cheeky kid had become a top-tier diamond shining brighter than any other jewel. It was like he was seeing him through rose-colored glasses.

“Secretary Choi, tell me. Does our Hye-in lack in looks or intelligence compared to daughters of other families?”

“No, Chairman. The young lady is an excellent match in both looks and intelligence.”

Indeed, his daughter, who was studying at a prestigious Ivy League school abroad, was different from the children of other families who chose to study abroad as a form of escape.

And what about her looks? She had inherited the fine features of her mother, a famous Korean actress.

Yet Kang Hyun remained unyielding, like an impregnable fortress.

“Did you say other groups are also trying?”

“Yes, Chairman. All the companies except Jeil Group from the top five that gathered at Seungjeongwon have contacted Kang Hyun. Even among the top ten companies, many are trying to get in touch with him.”

“Those hyena-like bastards, they have a knack for sniffing things out.”

Indeed, if there was an unmarried daughter in a conglomerate family, Kang Hyun would be a highly desirable son-in-law.

Especially, the top five conglomerate heads were astonished by Kang Hyun at Seungjeongwon.

But the problem was that Kang Hyun showed no sign of yielding.

“That boy, his confidence is still the same. Keep pushing. If it doesn’t work, arrange a chance meeting with Hye-in. We can’t let him be taken by Chairman Son.”

It was already well-known in the business world that Jeil Group was backing Kang Hyun.

But Kim Seongrak couldn't give up on Kang Hyun. VH Company and the image of Kang Hyun as a conductor at the concert had a seductive charm.

Surely, keeping him close would make him shine even more.

* * *

Why does the back of my head itch as if someone is talking about me?

I sat in my studio, blankly staring at the sheet music. But the notes on the staff did not enter my eyes.

Indeed, who would have thought that I would receive such a proposal from the Empress Caras of Austria?

“Empress Caras.”

Even in my past life, I had never met the legendary maestro.

By the time I developed an interest in classical music, Caras had never appeared in public, let alone conducted.

Many musicians had said in unison. If they could listen to one performance before they die, it would be Caras's conducting.

“Hyuna, can I talk to you for a moment?”

It was then that Director Im Hyera came to the studio.

“EMA seems to want to release the live recording of your and Mr. Jung Hoon’s concert.”

“The live recording?”

“Yes, given the initial sales of your second album, there is global demand for this concert recording. There have been many inquiries from your fans and Mr. Jung Hoon’s fans. It would be good to think about it positively. And what about the concert hosted by Gramophone? Have you thought about it?”

I felt like even two bodies wouldn’t be enough. In my past life, I worked myself to the bone chasing power and material desires.

But in this life, even if I tried to live a simple and contented life, those around me wouldn’t let me. It was then.

“Oh, Director Kim Sang-guk contacted you. He said he couldn’t reach you, so he’s coming to the gallery himself.”

Oh no, I had been so busy that I hadn’t even noticed Director Kim Sang-guk's calls.

Not long after Director Im Hyera left the studio, Director Kim Sang-guk arrived. His square jaw and sharp eyes were the same as ever.

“Director—!”

Normally, he would have shouted “Junior—!” but this time, Director Kim Sang-guk was calling me “Director” with a wide smile.

Was this person always someone who smiled so broadly?

“It’s a jackpot.”

“A jackpot?”

“Do you remember investing in the Austrian Calvin Pharmaceuticals?”

Somehow, I didn’t remember. It was one of the companies I invested in based on their financial statements and growth potential, not necessarily because I knew them.

One of them was a pharmaceutical company.

“They’ve succeeded in developing a new anti-cancer virus drug!”

Well, as they say, “Fortune favors the bold.”

Starting with the Empress Caras of Austria, unexpected good fortune kept coming.
