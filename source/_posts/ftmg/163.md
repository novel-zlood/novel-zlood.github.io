“What do you think about the U.S. trade policy?”

Son Yooha spoke fluent French.

“You just need to say what you normally think.”

Noah felt that the girl sitting in front of him was very different. After retiring from the FBI, he had worked as a butler for the upper class a few times. Although he was called a butler, in reality, he was more like a bodyguard.

Noah had met countless members of the upper class. However, when you stripped away the glamorous facade, many of them were no different from thugs in the slums.

“Noah?”

At Son Yooha's call, Noah nodded. After explaining briefly, he handed over the documents he had prepared to her. It was hard to believe that such a concise and clear description was written by such a young girl.

“Did you expect such a question?”

“No, I just wrote it as a hobby.”

Noah was convinced that if the girl in front of him wasn’t the heir of an Asian tycoon, she would have been scouted by the FBI at the youngest age ever.

Not only was she proficient in languages, but her character, likely influenced by her early education in imperial studies, was also extraordinary. Moreover, her insight and depth in viewing the world were on par with most adults.

“Noah, you said you lived in England too, right?”

“I lived there for over ten years, so yes, you could say that.”

“What does a royal performance in England signify?”

At Son Yooha's question, Noah explained what he knew. A royal performance in England held significant traditional meaning.

Especially in the classical music world, people aspired to perform at a royal event as much as they wanted to be knighted.

“Two years ago, there was a young maestro who conducted at the youngest age in the British royal family. I know him. In fact, I was a fan of his since he played the violin. Come to think of it, I heard he is Korean like Yooha?”

“Yes, and I heard he got a perfect score on the Korean SAT this time. The first in Korean entrance exam history.”

“Korea is truly an amazing country. To have another smart person like Yooha. It's really incredible. I never imagined that Hyun, the violinist, would be so talented in academics too. Although I knew he was extraordinary.”

Son Yooha brushed her dry lips. She thought she was catching up, but every time, Kang Hyun moved further ahead. Kang Hyun was the only person she felt such a high wall of talent from in her life.

When it was break time, Noah quietly stepped aside. Son Yooha took out a photo from her wallet and looked at it. Her icy expression melted away.

“I’m worried—!”

The reason for Son Yooha's worry was simple. If Kang Hyun entered university, there would be different female students waiting for him.

She wanted to stick to Kang Hyun like a magnet in Korea, but she had to complete her studies.

Son Yooha cherished the photo deeply in her heart.

“Oppa.”

It was a memory that served as a strong support in her lonely life abroad.

“We’ve arrived, Kang Hyun.”

He was taken aback by the scenery outside the car window. In front of the gallery, not only were there reporters, but also students in uniforms.

If he hadn’t snuck in through the back door, he might have been blinded by the reporters' spotlights.

“Noona, how long have the reporters been here?”

“It’s been a week. That’s why I told you not to come to the gallery. If they find out you’re here, the reporters will go crazy knocking on the door. Next time, we’ll come to you, so stay at Ichon-dong or the Seoul Arts Center.”

“I was just feeling restless. But if someone sees me, they might think I committed a major crime.”

He understood the excessive interest from the reporters. However, he didn’t expect to have such a large fandom.

Kim Mihyun jokingly said he was becoming more famous than Seo Taiji, and it seemed to be becoming a reality.

He was seriously considering hiring a manager.

“Hyun, shouldn’t you reveal the repertoire and venue for the solo concert?”

It was Im Hyera, the director, who suddenly appeared in the studio. Her face was full of interest rather than fatigue.

It seemed that being a management representative suited her more than being an artist in the gallery.

“It’s okay to reveal the venue, but I think it’s better to keep the repertoire confidential.”

“Like the first solo concert?”

“Yes, since they are my original compositions, people won’t know even if the repertoire is disclosed. It’s better to keep it confidential and let them be curious.”

Like the first solo concert, the second one was also filled with his original compositions.

Moreover, none of the pieces had titles yet. If he revealed a repertoire with just numbers, it would be disrespectful to the audience.

“If EMA finds out that you filled the second solo concert with original compositions, they will rush to release an album. This time, their representative even said he wanted to attend your solo concert.”

Indeed, when the original compositions used in the first solo concert were released as his first album, the initial stock sold out in less than half a day.

The unexpected popularity was evident from the number of zeros in his bank account.

“By the way, have you decided on a university?”

“I think I’ll go to Korea University for now.”

“Korea University?”

It was the pinnacle of Korean entrance exams.

There’s even a saying that to see the future of Korea, you should look at Korea University.

“Have you decided on a major?”

He had no intention of studying music in Korea since he had excellent teachers in England and Germany.

Someone once asked if he would consider studying law. After all, it was the end goal of the entrance exam war.

Having done it once, he was confident he could enter the law department and pass the bar exam at the youngest age if he set his mind to it.

But that was just showing off, not what he wanted.

“German language.”

Given that German was a weak point and he planned to complete the conductor course in Germany later, it wasn’t a bad choice.

“But I wonder if I’ll have enough time to attend university.”

If he didn’t have enough time for university, he could always drop out.

Im Hyera’s eyes widened in surprise at the mention of dropping out, but in hindsight, many famous people had dropped out of university.

* * *

The director of the Seoul Arts Center couldn’t calm his excitement. As the date of Kang Hyun's solo concert approached, his heart raced as if it was malfunctioning.

It might have started from the day he first saw the rehearsal between Kang Hyun and Hirose. Although it was just a practice session, the two played as if they were giving their all.

He wished he could have recorded that day’s scene forever.

“Director, thirty minutes left.”

The staff’s words brought the excited director back to reality.

It was time to regain composure. After all, it was the most important day of the solo concert. The ticket sales were about to begin.

The director was very grateful to Kang Hyun. He knew that many prestigious concert halls worldwide had sent countless love calls to Kang Hyun.

“Everyone, stay focused—!”

The staff’s faces were tense. They had prepared more phone lines than usual and deployed several times more personnel for offline ticketing.

Selling out over 2,000 seats in a concert hall is no easy task. Especially for a solo concert, it would take days.

For example, when a famous Chinese cellist held a solo concert at the Seoul Arts Center, they had to close the third-floor seats because tickets didn’t sell out even after a week.

But Kang Hyun was different.

Gulp.

From early morning, the area in front of the Seoul Arts Center was crowded with Kang Hyun’s fans. It was a sight rarely seen in the classical music world. Usually, it’s hard for young students to like classical music. But the scene was reminiscent of an idol group’s concert ticketing.

“Five minutes left!”

At the staff’s shout, everyone’s throats bobbed.

The moment the second hand on the clock reached the ticketing start time, the phones, which had been reconnected, started ringing like crazy.

* * *

“Ten minutes?”

Kang Hyun couldn’t believe what Im Hyera, the director, told him. Didn’t all the seats sell out in an hour during the first solo concert, setting a new record?

But this time, all the seats sold out in ten minutes, which was unbelievable.

“The overseas ratio is higher than during the first solo concert. People are going crazy trying to get even the third-floor box seats. The Seoul Arts Center is in complete chaos. They’ve been constantly getting calls and the number of people coming offline is overwhelming.”

Even the third-floor seats, which didn’t offer a good view, sold out instantly. The reaction was far beyond what he had expected.

Moreover, this wasn’t the era of online reservations. The 2,500 seats were sold out solely through offline and phone reservations.

“The Seoul Arts Center said this record would be unprecedented. The director was so excited that he stuttered, saying the phones were ringing off the hook. And he asked me to tell you personally.”

“To me?”

“If there are any shortcomings in the concert hall, let them know immediately. They said they would make every effort to suit your taste. I didn’t know the director was so passionate about classical performances.”

Indeed, the position of the Seoul Arts Center director was more political than musical.

But the current director was different. He was attentive to my reactions during every rehearsal, making the Seoul Arts Center concert hall a great choice for the solo concert.

“Hyun, your outfit looks great today.”

Then Im Hyera gave a thumbs-up. It had been a while since he wore a suit. Unlike before, when he looked like a student in his father’s clothes, the suit fit well with his longer limbs.

“If you spruce up a bit more, you could really be an idol.”

“Director, you’re exaggerating.”

“No, I mean it.”

There were already female students gathering in front of the gallery. Whenever he showed his face at the window, they screamed, “Oppa,” making his ears ring.

It was something unimaginable in his previous life. Even Im Hyera’s insistence on skincare treatments made him feel like an idol.

Although he didn’t care much about looks, it wasn’t bad to have better hair and skin.

Initially, he disliked it, but now he understood why celebrities cared so much about their appearance.

“After today’s broadcast, you’ll have even more female fans nationwide.”

“No way.”

“Really, Yooha might have to be on guard.”

With Im Hyera’s escort, he got into the car. Both Im Hyera and Kim Mihyun, sitting in the passenger seat, and the driver looked tense.

He never imagined he would visit the Blue House, a place he hadn’t even dreamed of entering in his previous life.

In a way, he had a deep connection with politics. Didn’t he work tirelessly to enter Yeouido in his past life?

Thinking about the lengths he went to wear a golden badge made his face flush with embarrassment.

Crunch.

He vowed to live a life without regrets this time.

How much time had passed? The Blue House came into view outside the car window.
