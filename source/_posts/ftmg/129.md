"Are you talking about Tchaikovsky's Pathetique?"

Conductor Samuel unknowingly raised his voice.

"Maestro, no matter how talented Hyun is, he's only sixteen years old. We've already confirmed his abilities as a violinist, but conducting? Even Gustav, who is called the eternal maestro, didn't hold the baton at that age. There will also be considerable resistance from the members."

"Samuel, do you really think so?"

"Pardon?"

At that moment, Samuel recalled when Kang Hyun conducted the second movement of Pathetique for the members.

It was a brief tuning session meant to recall the melody of the Moscow Philharmonic, yet it was so skillful. He looked like a veteran who had experienced such things hundreds of times.

"The first time I held the baton was in Heshwald, Saxony. As a guest conductor, no one even knew my name. Guest means an outsider. When rehearsal time was over, the members would promptly close their scores and put away their instruments. Of course, at that level, it would have been nothing. Although it was disappointing, they had a set time promised to them."

"Maestro."

"When you conduct, there are times when you lose tempo or create dissonance that you didn't intend. In my younger years, my abilities as a conductor were not very high. However, whenever that happened, the sharp-eared members would pack up and leave right away."

The pride of orchestra members is tremendous. Especially towards guest conductors, they were even more strict. From their perspective, it was a way of drawing a line.

If you lacked skill or showed even a little gap, you were bound to fall out of their favor. That's why conductors aren't called eternal uninvited guests until they secure their own orchestra.

"What do you think would happen if I met the Berlin Philharmonic of today with the me back then? I'd probably freeze up, unable to even lift the baton, struggling to keep up with the interpretation and flow of the Berlin Philharmonic, making a fool of myself."

It wasn't a self-deprecating expression. He was honestly speaking about the way things were. Although he is now called the Lion of the Berlin Philharmonic, it wasn't like that decades ago.

"Look at Hyun now. I'm not talking about his rapport with the members. Erase his age and boyish appearance and look at his inner talent. That kid clearly has enough talent as a conductor. The question is how big his potential is. I want to find out on this stage."

If one hadn't met the violinist Hyun in person, it would be an unbelievable story. Who would entrust the conducting of the Berlin Philharmonic to a young boy? And conducting Tchaikovsky's Pathetique, no less.

The Lion of the Berlin Philharmonic, Yuri, added with a peculiar smile.

"There is a superstition among conductors like a proverb. You end up being part of the orchestra where you made your debut."

If Spencer of London had heard this, he would have probably glared.

Is this how monks contemplating leaving the world feel? Even though it's not menopause, my heart feels restless.

When I came to Berlin and London, I tried to avoid exposure to the outside as much as possible. I intended to absorb the knowledge from the maestros and disappear like a blink. The reason was simple.

'Tsk.'

What happened to the prodigies who received excessive media attention when they were young?

I was different, but I hated excessive media attention. Didn't I feel it deeply in my past life?

At first, one gets addicted to people's attention, but soon realizes it's like nutritionally worthless junk food. Especially if you're not entering politics.

Moreover, in my case, I had a stronger propensity for self-satisfaction than for fame as a musician.

"Hyun, we've arrived."

Krissy's voice snapped me out of my thoughts.

Outside the car window, there was a small shop that looked like an antique store, and seeing the German name "Fate of the Deer," I knew I had come to the right place.

Where is this place? It was the Berlin music shop Maestro Gustav had once hinted to me about.

He had told me to definitely visit this place when I came to Germany.

"Krissy, please wait in the car for a moment."

"Hyun, don't disappear suddenly like last time. You won't move to another place without saying anything, right? Promise me."

"Don't worry, I'll just be here. How could a sparrow pass by a mill?"

Krissy stared at me with her eyes wide open. It seemed she didn't understand my Korean joke.

Tinkle.

The small bell on the doorknob signaled the arrival of a customer. However, the old man with white hair didn't even get up from his seat.

I didn't really care whether I was greeted or not.

"Oh-oh!"

Even if I saw a Patek Philippe, my eyes wouldn't widen like this. The batons made of walnut, ash, and olive wood caught my attention.

Is there no place like this in my country? Not only is the unit price lower, but the demand is also small, so there are few sellers. In the 90s in Jongno, where classical music was declining, it was hard to find high-quality batons.

"Yes, this grip."

Conductors are picky. They go to great lengths to find a baton that suits them.

If you know how important the balance and grip of the baton are when conducting, you will understand how valuable this small wooden stick is.

Some sensitive conductors even cut the branches themselves and sand them down, that's how serious they are.

"Hmm."

For example, it's like looking at a display of luxury watches, but they all seem vague. Or like Harry Potter choosing a magic wand. There was no baton that perfectly matched my liking. At that moment.

Zing―!

A high-pitched sound, like a bow scraping a string, caught my ear. The source of the sound was none other than the old man with white hair.

He was holding a violin and seemed to be wrestling with it as if in a classical struggle. It wasn't tuning; it looked like he was fighting with the violin.

In the end, I couldn't stand it and moved closer.

"Sir, may I take a look?"

"You?"

"Yes, I know a bit about violins."

Although my German was clumsy, there was no problem in communication.

The old man's wrinkled eyes were filled with doubt and suspicion as he handed me the violin.

It was natural; seeing a young man who was younger than himself, who had spent his whole life in a music shop, claiming to know more about violins. However, after a few touches.

Zing.

A soft and rich melody was heard. The old man looked at me as if he couldn't believe his ears. It was possible because I had more sensitive senses and hearing than others.

I could perceive the very slight warp in the fingerboard and soundboard under the string. For example, if I exaggerated, the difference between the old man's vision and mine would be like that between a magnifying glass and a microscope.

"Wait, can you look at these too?"

The old man, who had been stunned, hurriedly stood up.

Before long, he came out hugging several old violin cases.

I wondered why there were so many old violins stored in a music shop.

"Hoo―!"

I felt like a renowned doctor. Just as I was about to get up after tuning the last patient, I mean, violin.

"Young man, take this."

"Pardon?"

"I saw you glancing at the batons earlier. Unfortunately, those over there don't suit you. Ash wood has a good grip, but the balance is off, and olive is the opposite."

Did he have eyes on the side of his head? He seemed to know exactly what I had done.

I accepted the small wooden box he handed me. Carefully opening the lid, I found an old baton lying inside.

"Grip it."

The grip fit perfectly in my hand, and the balance was excellent. But the most important thing was that my heart started pounding like crazy as soon as I held the old baton.

Seeing my face flush red, the old man spoke.

"It contains the essence of Berlin."

* * *

Chirp, chirp.

The heat of August is at its peak. Under the scorching sun, as hot as the shimmering air over the asphalt, the piano keys did not stop.

Baek Junghoon's long fingers danced tirelessly over the keys. It was like watching a long-legged spider move.

"Here, marcato―!"

His fingertips sprang up from the keys like a spring. The melody was heavy and grand, but the touch was sharp.

From the shoulder to the elbow to the fingertips, he carefully pressed the black and white keys like a well-honed swordsman's blade.

Only after the last stroke.

"Haa―!"

Baek Junghoon exhaled the breath he had been holding and wiped the beads of sweat from his forehead.

The more he played while looking at the score, the more he admired Kang Hyun. The more he danced on the keys to interpret the composer's notes, the more it felt like walking through a maze.

Was it complicated and difficult? No, it was a sweet maze he never wanted to escape from.

No matter how much he practiced all night, it wasn't enough, but at the same time, he was looking forward to hearing what Kang Hyun would say about his performance.

"Junghoon, did you stay up all night again?"

At that moment, Im Hyera entered Kang Hyun's studio. Currently, only two people had access to Kang Hyun's studio when he wasn't there.

"Take a break now and then, I'm worried you'll collapse."

"I'd like to, but if I don't master this score, my little teacher will scold me."

"Teacher?"

Baek Junghoon added with a fresh smile.

"Director, when is Hyun returning tomorrow?"

"Oh, you haven't heard the news yet, Junghoon."

"Pardon?"

Im Hyera shook her head.

"Hyun decided to stay in Berlin for another week."

Should I be happy or not, a subtle emotion flickered in Baek Junghoon's eyes.

* * *

"Essence of Berlin?"

First violin associate principal Alberto couldn't help but laugh.

"Hyun, how much did you pay for it?"

Upon hearing the price, he said, "You got completely swindled." Seeing my puzzled expression, Alberto stopped laughing and explained.

"Fate of the Deer is an old place, but young musicians rarely visit it. There's a lot of dust, and the state of the scores is not very good, as you can see. Moreover, the owner is notoriously grumpy."

"Really?"

"Yes, what kind of wood did he say it was made from?"

Now that I think about it, I didn't hear what kind of wood it was made from. The grip fit perfectly in my hand, and the balance felt like an extension of my arm, so I grabbed it without thinking. Normally, I would have been meticulous, but that day I acted as if I were possessed.

"Still, it's a relief."

"Alberto?"

"Until now, you've been too perfect for your age, which was a bit scary. You seemed like a mini maestro, which made it even more so. It's good to see some flaws, it makes you seem more human."

I was grateful for the roundabout way of saying I was clumsy.

Normally, I should have left Berlin by now, but I decided to stay a bit longer.

Although I intended to stay quietly, the chance to perform with the Berlin Philharmonic, the world's best orchestra, was not something that came easily.

At that moment.

"Hyun, if your conducting is strange, we'll stop."

Concertmaster Samuel, who had been sitting quietly, spoke sharply.

The other members were the same. They seemed friendly, but as soon as they heard I would be conducting, they became cold and strict.

This was the way it should be. In front of music, they were endlessly cold and had a firm world of their own.

It was a rehearsal, but it felt more real than the actual performance.

"Hyun, if you want, you can join the violin section."

"I'll decline, Alberto."

It wasn't that I disliked the violin. The problem was something else. The old baton in my hand was making my heart pound so intensely.

My heartbeat was so clear that I could hear it even amidst the tuning of numerous instruments.
