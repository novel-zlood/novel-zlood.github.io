Breaking news: Dream, an Austrian venture company, has succeeded in expanding the safety of lithium-ion batteries. Although this is only the first phase of development, it is considered to have a significant implication for the lithium-ion industry. Let's hear more details from an expert.

Even in Silicon Valley, known for its talented individuals, the development of lithium-ion battery safety was not guaranteed to succeed.

The fact that such a significant development was achieved by mere rookies who barely graduated from college caused waves in the lithium-ion battery industry.

There were even rumors suggesting this might be the second coming of Bill Gates of Microsoft, indicating the immense impact.

Kim Sang-guk clicked his tongue as he watched the news on the TV. He had known about this since Dream contacted him months ago.

Kim Sang-guk thought Kang Hyun's bold investment strategy was high-risk, high-return, but it was completely different.

Like the Midas touch, seven out of ten talents pointed out by Kang Hyun continued to succeed. Even Warren Buffett, known as the king of investment, was not at this level.

"Could it be that Hyun will become the youngest chairman in Korea at this rate?"

It wasn't an impossible assumption. Kim Sang-guk had seen many members of chaebol families while working at Jeil Group, but it was rare to see someone achieve so much on their own like Kang Hyun.

Moreover, he was only twenty years old by Korean age.

Most chaebol third generations of his age were either studying abroad or idly wasting time. Even the smart ones were in the same situation.

In conservative Korean society, it was unheard of for a twenty-year-old to hold an executive position in a large corporation.

In that sense, Kang Hyun was rewriting the history of Korean business.

"Director, Jinil Securities contacted us again. This time, the vice president contacted us directly. He wants to have dinner with you."

"Hey, call me Director, not Manager."

"Sorry, I'm still used to calling you Manager. Anyway, should I reject Jinil Securities' offer like before?"

Kim Sang-guk nodded briefly. It had only been a few months since VH Company settled in Korea, but they were already receiving numerous external contacts.

Not only were securities firms offering investment partnerships, but even institutions were reaching out, so there was no need to say more.

In fact, VH Company’s popularity in the stock market was comparable to Jeil Group's Strategic Planning Office.

This was due to Kang Hyun's full support and welfare benefits.

With the investment in Barbara Tannenbaum and Austria's Calvin Pharmaceutical, VH Company had already made a significant mark in the investment world.

Not only did they achieve the highest salary in the industry, but their welfare benefits were also better than most Western conglomerates.

In short, Kang Hyun was generously using corporate profits for internal circulation.

Perhaps because of this, most people in the investment industry expressed a desire to join VH Company. However.

VH Company's key employees were all personally selected by Kim Sang-guk.

Not only did he hire resources who retired from the Strategic Planning Office, but he also scouted talents from other companies he had been eyeing, as if filling a shopping bag.

It was as if the top talents in Korea were gathered in one place. With an ordinary career, one couldn't even submit a resume to VH Company.

"Director, I tried to reject them, but the vice president of Jinil Securities was too persistent. After I kept refusing, the president himself contacted us, saying he wants to meet VH Company's CEO."

"Are you talking about President Kang Kyung-rok?"

"Yes, you know how those people have fiery tempers."

Since he had worked in the Strategic Planning Office, he had information on all the prominent securities company presidents in the country. Anyway.

"Tell them the CEO of VH Company is too busy and has no time."

"If I say that, they'll get very angry. They'll likely spread bad rumors about VH Company in the industry."

"If they want to spread rumors, let them. After all, it's the cowardly dogs that bark more. Besides, if they knew who was backing Kang Hyun, they'd be nailing their own coffin. Moreover, Kang Hyun doesn't have time to meet such small fry."

Elnon swallowed his saliva unconsciously. The other guests at the party felt the same tension.

There was an inexplicable tension in the air. The reason was simple. Barbara Tannenbaum, the chairwoman of the Barbara Group, had appeared at the party.

"Is that really Barbara?"

Some even rubbed their eyes with their sleeves to confirm Barbara's presence.

After all, who was Barbara Tannenbaum? She was a Jewish magnate known for her wealth in mining, railroads, and real estate in the United States.

Her insight and judgment were well-known in the investment world. Even Warren Buffett acknowledged her, which spoke volumes.

To exaggerate, she was as hard to meet as the President of the United States.

The people at the outdoor party were influential figures in New York, but compared to Barbara, they were like fireflies before the sun.

"Madam Chairwoman Barbara, thank you for personally attending our boss's charity event."

Miguel, the editor conducting the charity auction on stage, trembled as he held the microphone.

He never dreamed that Barbara would personally attend. Barbara responded to the welcome with a gentlemanly smile.

Perhaps because of Barbara's presence, the charity auction for Kang Hyun's performance was momentarily forgotten.

"Two million dollars."

Barbara started with a faint smile. Miguel, initially puzzled, understood from her deep gaze.

"The first bid for the charity auction of violinist Hyun's performance is two million dollars!"

She was indeed a magnate. Even though it was two million dollars, she acted as if she were handing over a lucky two dollars.

Her elegance and grace in her gestures and walk were so impressive that even the pop star Lux, who had been eyeing Kang Hyun seductively, didn't dare approach.

Meanwhile, others were filled with curiosity.

How on earth did Barbara Tannenbaum, the chairwoman of Barbara Group, know Kang Hyun?

Based on the external information about Kang Hyun, wasn't he a mysterious musical genius from the East?

On the surface, there seemed to be no connection between him and the Jewish magnate Barbara Tannenbaum.

Moreover, Barbara was known for not meeting just anyone easily. It was said that the "Lunch with Barbara" ticket at Sotheby's auctioned for a minimum of one million dollars annually. Yet.

Gulp.

Barbara Tannenbaum was smiling and conversing with Kang Hyun. Although the content of their conversation couldn't be heard, it was clear to anyone that they seemed quite close.

Everyone at the party, including Elnon, felt at that moment that Kang Hyun might be a much bigger deal than they had initially thought.

* * *

"Hyun, it's so good to see you like this after a long time."

After the charity event, Kang Hyun was invited to dinner by Barbara. It seemed that Barbara had come to New York specifically to meet Kang Hyun.

Even the organizers of the party, "Boss," didn't seem to know that Chairwoman Barbara would attend.

"Did I do a good job of raising your profile?"

"Of course, Madam Chairwoman."

"In fact, compared to your performance, that donation amount is rather modest."

Not only had she raised his profile, but the looks in people's eyes at the party were also clearly etched in Kang Hyun's mind.

Most people were looking back and forth between Kang Hyun and Barbara with a mix of surprise and curiosity. Elnon was no exception.

Naturally, they were curious about the connection between Kang Hyun and Chairwoman Barbara.

"How is life in New York? I heard from Tanya that you're staying at the Carlton Hotel."

"Yes, I’m currently staying at the Carlton Hotel and the studio provided by my agency. The only inconvenience is that more people recognize me on the streets than I expected."

"Hyun, you will become even more famous than you are now. If you don't mind, how about moving to our hotel instead of the Carlton?"

She meant the Barbara Hotel. Knowing Barbara's character, she would undoubtedly offer the best suite.

Kang Hyun politely declined. He was already grateful that Chairwoman Barbara offered such a large donation after watching his performance, and asking for a suite would be too much.

The Carlton Hotel, where Kang Hyun was currently staying, was also one of the renowned hotels in New York. It was then.

"Actually, the reason I came to see you today is to ask you something."

Barbara wiped her lips with a napkin and continued.

"There’s a company that Barbara Group is considering investing in on a large scale. We've reviewed their financial statements and confidential documents and judged it to be a good investment. However, there's something that's been bothering me."

Kang Hyun was puzzled. Employees at Barbara Group were known to be among the best in the U.S. Moreover, Chairwoman Barbara's judgment was on par with Chairman Wang.

"I came to seek your advice, Hyun."

"My advice?"

"Yes, do you remember our first meeting? A boy from the East suddenly proposed a deal to me."

‘There are three reasons why you should make a deal with me, Ms. Barbara.’

Suddenly, memories of the past flooded Kang Hyun's mind. Barbara, seemingly reminiscing about that day, smiled pleasantly.

"I know that you are running an investment company called VH Company in Korea. This time, I came to New York to propose a deal with you, not as violinist Hyun, but as the CEO of VH Company."

"Madam Chairwoman, if I may ask, which company are you planning to invest in?"

"You might have heard of it; it’s AOA, a pharmaceutical company that's been making a name for itself recently."

AOA...?

The name seemed familiar.

Kang Hyun felt a sense of déjà vu. But soon, memories from his past life quickly surfaced in his mind.

How could he forget? AOA was the pharmaceutical company that nearly led the U.S. to a great depression before the subprime mortgage crisis.

At that moment, Kang Hyun realized that Chairwoman Barbara had come to the right person.
