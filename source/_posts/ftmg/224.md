- Today, the famous person our documentary team is visiting is none other than the violinist Kang Hyun. Known as a musical prodigy since childhood, Kang Hyun has received love calls from maestros around the world, an already well-known story. Currently, he is studying as an exchange student at the Royal College of Music in South Kensington, England. As a PD and a huge fan of Kang Hyun, my heart is already fluttering with excitement.

Kim Da-hyun PD's excited voice transmitted to the viewers through the screen. In the mansion in Ichon-dong, Kang Hyun's grandfather, parents, and Chairman Wang were all gathered together to watch TV.

The scene of them huddled together in the living room looked almost like a typical family on a holiday.

"Father, it's Hyun!"

Kang Hyun's mother, Yoo Hyun-ja, exclaimed with joy at seeing Kang Hyun appear on the screen.

Even the grandfather's eyes were glued to his grandson's face, which he hadn't seen in a long time.

"In-laws, no matter how much I look at him, our son-in-law is just too handsome."

"Of course, isn't it obvious? He looks like me, that's why he's so good-looking!"

"Oh, come on, in-laws. How can you lie without even wetting your lips? If he looked like you, he would look scary like a bear. Clearly, he got all the good traits from Hyun-ja and Kang."

The two grandfathers were bantering as usual.

Chairman Wang had a playful expression on his face. It was hard to believe that he had just called an emergency meeting of the board members of a conglomerate.

"Hyun really looks good on screen. My daughter-in-law told me that Hollywood once offered Hyun a role."

"Hollywood?"

"Yes, Hollywood. A famous director contacted Hyun several times, wanting to make a romance film with classical music, but Hyun declined every offer, saying he was far from being an actor. But if that director sees this documentary, he might contact him again."

It wasn't just Hollywood. Renowned magazines in the U.S. and Europe had also repeatedly contacted Jeil Gallery to use Kang Hyun as a model.

The offered contract sums were unimaginably large for ordinary people, but Kang Hyun had flatly refused. It wasn't about the money; he simply hated the hassle.

- Now, we're at Kang Hyun's practice room. As a violinist, Kang Hyun has already received praise from numerous maestros for his exceptional skills. He was also the first Korean to win the Queen Elisabeth Competition. Let's listen to Kang Hyun's violin performance.

As Kang Hyun lifted the violin in his practice room, the screen and even the viewers seemed to hold their breath.

Chairman Wang leaned forward, watching intently as if it were a thrilling movie scene.

As soon as they got out of the limousine, the barrage of camera shutters was overwhelming for Tommy. Especially the reporters trying to capture Kang Hyun's image were the highlight.

If Sabrina hadn't held his hand, he would have been frozen in place, unable to move.

'Wow!'

After the photo session at the photo line, they stepped into the grand mansion where the Gramophone music event was being held, and Tommy's mouth dropped open.

It was like a scene from a movie. Various delicacies were laid out everywhere, and servers were walking around with serving trays.

Gulp.

The people in the mansion were all elegant and refined, as if they were prominent figures in society.

Considering that most of them were elderly, Kang Hyun, Tommy, and Sabrina were undoubtedly the youngest in the mansion.

"Hyun, I've been waiting for you!"

At that moment, a middle-aged man with white hair approached Kang Hyun and greeted him warmly.

It wasn't just one middle-aged man. As soon as Kang Hyun appeared, people rushed to greet him as if they had been waiting for him.

It was a scene that might have overwhelmed someone, but Kang Hyun greeted them skillfully, as if he had done it a hundred times.

'Impressive.'

To Tommy, Kang Hyun seemed like a true adult. If he were in Kang Hyun's shoes, he would have been frozen in the crowd, unable to do anything.

But Kang Hyun was not only greeting older people skillfully, he was also engaging in light-hearted conversations. Even his gait and the way he held his wine glass exuded ease and elegance.

"Tommy, what are you doing?"

"Huh?"

"Try this, it's really delicious!"

On the other hand, Sabrina was another person who seemed at ease.

Like Kang Hyun, rather than being intimidated by the social gathering, Sabrina was savoring the food provided one by one.

With silver hair and deep turquoise eyes, Sabrina drew the attention of many people just by walking around, but she didn't seem to care about the gazes around her.

At that moment.

"Are you cellist Tommy?"

The person had a square jaw and sharp eyes. Tommy wondered if he knew such a person but he didn't.

"I watched your performance at the Royal College of Music concert from the audience."

"Oh, thank you!"

"I'm Adam Whishaw, the editor-in-chief of Gramophone."

Tommy's eyes widened.

The name Adam Whishaw, the editor-in-chief of Gramophone, was familiar even to him. Known for his sharp critiques and reviews on classical music, he was famous among musicians.

Adam handed his business card to Tommy and continued carefully.

"Tommy, what are your plans after graduating from the Royal College of Music?"

With Tommy's graduation from the Royal College of Music approaching, Adam's question made him hesitate. He aimed to join an orchestra, but he didn't have any notable career achievements yet.

At that moment.

"If you don't mind, how about taking an audition for the Chicago Symphony?"

"The Chicago Symphony?"

"Yes, the maestro of the Chicago Symphony attended the Royal College of Music concert as an audience member. He was sitting right next to me. He was very impressed with your cello performance."

Tommy gulped at the following words.

"He said if such a talent comes to audition for his orchestra, he would immediately take them in as a member."

* * *

'This is overwhelming.'

Kang Hyun appeared calm while interacting with people, but internally, he was overwhelmed.

Of course, as soon as he appeared, not only famous musicians but also entrepreneurs involved in the classical industry rushed to him.

If he hadn't had past experiences, he would have been overwhelmed by the atmosphere, unable to greet them skillfully.

"Hyun, what do you think of my proposal?"

It was Austin, the representative of the prestigious European classical label EMA.

After releasing Kang Hyun's album, it achieved record-breaking sales worldwide. The name Kang Hyun held significant power in the classical market.

He had already amassed a substantial number of die-hard fans compared to his debut year.

"Sorry, Representative. I have nothing to say about album releases today. I don't feel my skills are good enough to confidently present to the public yet."

"Hyun, excessive modesty can be detrimental. When I heard the trio piece you composed at the Royal College of Music concert, I was beyond moved; it was like experiencing a new world. Many classical enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting your new album. Please don't disappoint them too much. This is not a request from the representative of EMA, but from a devoted fan."

Even after EMA representative Austin left, numerous famous figures continued to approach Kang Hyun. Among them were representatives of well-known companies.

Some asked for his autograph, while others subtly inquired if he would consider representing their companies as a model. There were even questions about whether he considered switching agencies.

'Tsk.'

A typical musician might have been distracted by such rhetoric, unknowingly getting swayed.

But not Kang Hyun. In his past life, he was not only a prosecutor in the Western District but also an ambitious person with political aspirations. He had mastered the art of social interactions.

"Editor-in-chief Adam?"

At that moment, Kang Hyun noticed Adam, the editor-in-chief of Gramophone, standing next to Tommy and approached him.

"Hyun, it's been a long time!"

Adam greeted Kang Hyun warmly.

While exchanging greetings, Kang Hyun glanced at Tommy, wondering what Adam had said to him, as Tommy looked dazed.

Just as he thought he would ask about it after the music event.

"Hyun, did you bring the item for the charity auction?"

"Yes, I brought it as requested."

"Thank you very much. Your item will undoubtedly be a huge hit at the charity auction!"

A week ago, Gramophone had contacted him, asking him to bring an item for the charity auction at the music event.

"May I ask what you brought?"

Adam asked curiously, his eyes sparkling.

"It's nothing special."

"It's fine. If it's Hyun's item, even a used toothbrush would fetch a fortune among your die-hard fans who are here today. Hyun's popularity in the classical field is immense. What did you bring?"

"A music score."

Adam's eyes widened like saucers. Known as one of Gramophone's 'Three Devils' for his unwavering charisma as editor-in-chief, Adam was visibly surprised.

He composed himself and asked again.

"A music score?"

"Yes, it's a piece I composed when I was young. It's a piano solo piece and has never been performed. Mainly because I haven't found a suitable musician to play it. I thought it would be better for it to see the light of day than to remain buried among other scores."

Kang Hyun added with a faint smile.

"However, there is one condition for the charity auction. The piece must not be made public until a suitable pianist is found."

He could have thought of pianist Baek Jung-hoon, but the piece was not suitable for him.

For Kang Hyun, it was just one of the many scores piled up like a mountain, but for others, it was different.

This was evident from Adam's reaction, swallowing hard as if he were entranced by the word 'score.'

Adam cautiously looked around.

Kang Hyun's condition was somewhat stringent, but not impossible to meet.

Moreover, the grand mansion where the music event was held was filled with well-known wealthy individuals from Europe.

Adam composed himself and spoke seriously.

"This charity auction will undoubtedly set a record in Gramophone's history."
