"The variation wasn't good, moreover, you didn't control your emotions properly."

This was the evaluation of the French maestro, Hugo.

As the final stage began, two hundred novice violinists selected from around the world headed to Brussels.

It was a stage that unfolded over a span of fifteen days. Every day, dozens of participants took to the stage, and judges from various countries evaluated and scored them.

Only the top 12 with the highest combined scores could head to Chapelle.

"That was a sloppy performance."

Victor frowned and turned away as if there was nothing more to see.

Perhaps aware of the judges' harsh evaluations, the violinist on stage was trembling.

It must have been due to extreme nervousness that their usual skills were not showing.

'Tsk.'

Kang Hyun clicked his tongue inwardly. It was a pressure he hadn't realized seven years ago when he last visited Brussels.

On the other hand, it was understandable. After all, who were the people sitting on the judges' panel? They were all maestros from various countries, whom the novice violinists admired and longed to meet. If anyone didn't tremble even a little, their heart must have been made of steel.

'But still.'

Maybe his expectations were too high, as the level of the participants who followed was mediocre.

They were selected from thousands of applicants. However, some performed so poorly that they seemed like different people compared to their audition tapes.

Of course, they must have maintained their best condition while recording the audition tape and repeated the recording until there were no mistakes. But the stage is real life.

Twang!

The pitch was off. It was proof that too much force was applied to the fingers pressing the strings.

On stage, even a single mistake couldn't be tolerated. Moreover, the maestros in the judges' seats didn't miss even the smallest mistakes of the participants.

How many days had it been like this, witnessing the mistakes of violinists?

"Next."

The expressions of the violinists coming down from the stage were all the same. Their shoulders were slumped endlessly, and their faces were fleetingly filled with self-reproach and disappointment.

What about the judges? It was like drinking flat cola, a continuous feeling of dissatisfaction. At that moment,

"Participant number 71."

With her platinum blonde hair swaying, Anna stepped onto the stage.

She was already a renowned prodigy at the Moscow Conservatory. Moreover, wasn't she the girl who remained among the final twelve in the Queen Elisabeth Competition seven years ago? At that time, she was the youngest participant besides Kang Hyun.

The Chinese maestro, Deng Lun, who was a judge seven years ago, as well as Hirose and even Victor, leaned forward, eagerly awaiting Anna's performance.

Anna took a deep breath and then positioned herself gracefully, like flowing water.

Paganini's Caprice No. 24.

Who would have thought she would choose this piece? It was a piece that encompassed a multitude of techniques. Considering Anna's usual disposition, it seemed quite distant.

But as the piece began, Anna's eyes changed as if by magic. Parallel octaves, arpeggios, high positions, fast passages, pizzicatoâ€”an unbroken series of fearless techniques.

The bowing was fierce, as if not missing a single thirty-second note from the sheet music. Her long, white fingers, pressing the strings, slid skillfully over them like a spider.

An exclamation of admiration burst from Hugo, who was sitting next to him.

'She's grown a lot.'

Kang Hyun's eyes were evidently filled with emotion. It was similar to the feeling of a parent looking at their grown child.

It was a performance of a different dimension from the Queen Elisabeth seven years ago.

There was no longer a shy, nervous little girl. Her platinum blonde hair fluttered in the wind, and her green eyes were confidently expanding her presence.

Even after the performance ended and the bow pointed to the floor, none of the judges spoke first.

It was proof that everyone was deeply moved. Unlike other participants, Anna confidently exited the stage.

"That was a truly excellent performance."

Starting with Hugo,

"Although I expected it since the director of the Moscow Conservatory wrote a recommendation letter, I didn't expect it to be this good. It felt like discovering a gem after a long time."

"Unless there's an upset, that participant named Anna might win this year."

"Indeed, she's a student raised by Alexei. Her performance was clearly of a different level from the other participants."

The judges continued to share their opinions. Rather than finding mistakes, it seemed like a moment to relieve the lingering emotions as an audience member. It was a sight that couldn't be seen in the previous final stages.

"Finally, it feels like my eyes are cleansed."

Even Victor, who seldom showed a pleasant expression, seemed pleased. At the moment, Victor met Kang Hyun's eyes and turned his head sharply, as if he had no further interest.

It seemed like Victor blamed Kang Hyun for having to spend time together. In reality, it was just that the two youngest judges were assigned together.

At that moment,

"Participant number 72."

Another participant stepped onto the stage. Most of the judges didn't seem to expect much, perhaps because it was the performance right after Anna's. Well, it was still a short time to shake off the lingering emotions from Anna's performance.

But at that moment, Hirose's eyes lit up as he leaned forward. Kang Hyun realized only then upon seeing the presence on stage.

Sabrina.

With her white hair, Sabrina had a tendency to draw attention just by her presence.

Moreover, she was distinctly different from the other participants. As if she had swallowed the word "nervous," her face was evidently relaxed.

Kang Hyun chuckled at her appearance. And he instinctively knew. Once Sabrina's performance started, the judges would once again be deeply moved.

The final stage, which lasted for fifteen days, ended. Anna looked down at the calluses on her hands. It was proof that the seven years had not been in vain.

"It's still the same here."

Anna smiled as she looked at Chapelle, known as the Dawn of Melody. Chapelle, unchanged from seven years ago, still held a mysterious beauty.

She had not yet greeted the other eleven violinists besides herself. Anna recalled her past memories as she took steps around Chapelle.

"That's right, here that time."

Anna stopped in the kitchen. It was because a memory from the past came to mind.

It was when she was hungry in the middle of the night and headed to the kitchen. Anna, who planned to eat toast with butter, saw two faint silhouettes in front of her. A man and a woman were embracing each other, using the soft light from the refrigerator as a lamp.

"Pfft."

Thinking back on it made her laugh involuntarily. The person whose eyes met directly with the then-short Anna was none other than Kang Hyun.

Come to think of it, how was William doing? Rumor had it that he was touring Europe and holding concerts.

As she was immersed in her past memories and taking steps,

Zing.

Anna's head turned towards an unexpected melody. It was coming from the garden of Chapelle. The twelve violinists had not yet all gathered. Who could be playing?

Anna walked as if entranced. Someone was playing, accompanied by the occasional sound of insects and the wind.

Zing.

The sound was so sweet that Anna swallowed her saliva without realizing it.

Under the warm sunlight of Chapelle, someone was stepping on the grass with bare feet.

The sight of them playing the violin was so beautiful that Anna was entranced. And she spoke without realizing it.

"Hyun?"

It was a similar feeling to when she encountered Hyun, who was playing the violin under the dawn in the past.

But the person who lowered the bow and turned their head was none other than a white-haired girl.

* * *

"Mr. Hyun, how do you feel about being invited as the youngest judge?"

Belgium's national broadcaster was producing a documentary about the Queen Elisabeth Competition. The producer was conducting interviews not only with the participants at Chapelle but also with the judges.

This time, it was Kang Hyun's turn. He smiled lightly and answered.

"At first, I felt overwhelmed by the position."

"Does that mean you don't feel that way anymore?"

"Sitting in such an important position as a judge, I can't afford to be nervous anymore. I'm doing my best not to let down the participants and the other judges."

The producer, who had distinct facial features, nodded and continued with the questions.

"Mr. Hyun, you won the Queen Elisabeth Competition as the youngest participant seven years ago, and now you're the youngest judge. What differences are there between the competition then and now?"

"Even back then, many skilled violinists participated in the competition. Of course, there are many skilled participants this year as well. If I had to compare, I would unfortunately have to favor the participants from seven years ago."

"Is there a specific reason?"

"This year, I am not among the participants, am I?"

The producer smiled at Kang Hyun's joke. Indeed, Kang Hyun was different from other judges. He responded calmly even to a boring interview and had a clear sense of broadcasting. Wasn't he the one who captivated many Americans with his eloquence on the Ellen Show?

"Who do you think is the most likely candidate to win this year?"

"The twelve violinists selected for Chapelle, known as the Dawn of Melody, all possess exceptional skills. It's hard to pick one as particularly outstanding."

"What if you were included as a participant among those twelve?"

Kang Hyun answered with a smile. At that moment, the producer seemed to remember something and spoke.

"Ah, I heard that the judges also stay together in a mansion for eight days while interacting with the participants. Is it true that two of the judges will be roommates?"

Where did they get such information?

"Yes, it's true."

"Rumor has it that the Russian maestro Victor and you, Mr. Hyun, will be roommates. Is that correct?"

"Yes, that's correct."

The producer showed a meaningful smile. It seemed like he found a satisfactory scene to include in the documentary about the eight days at Chapelle.

The producer already knew how difficult Victor's personality was.

"Living with Victor might cause some trouble. Are you willing to stay with him considering that?"

Should he say they became friends? To be precise, they were assigned to the same room because they weren't close. But he couldn't let the producer manipulate him. Kang Hyun answered with a smile once again.

"If you had the chance to be roommates with another judge instead of Victor, what would you do?"

"I would still want to be roommates with Victor."

After all, it was already a done deal. Saying he didn't like Victor now wouldn't help.
