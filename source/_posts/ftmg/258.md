"The variations are not good, and moreover, you failed to properly control your emotions."

This was the evaluation from the French maestro, Hugo.

As the final stage began, 200 young violinists selected from around the world headed to Brussels.

It was a stage that would unfold over a span of fifteen days. Every day, dozens of participants took the stage, and judges from various countries evaluated and scored them.

Only the top 12 with the highest combined scores could advance to Chapelle.

"What a sloppy performance."

Victor furrowed his brows and turned his gaze away as if he had seen enough.

Perhaps aware of the judges' harsh evaluations, the violinist on stage was trembling.

It was likely due to extreme nervousness that their usual skills were not showing.

'Tsk.'

Kang Hyun clicked his tongue in his mind. It was a pressure he hadn't realized seven years ago when he first came to Brussels.

On one hand, he understood. Who were the judges sitting in their seats? They were the maestros from various countries that young violinists admired. If anyone wasn’t trembling, their heart must be made of steel.

'Still.'

Perhaps his expectations were too high, but the level of the participants who followed was disappointing.

These were the ones selected from thousands of applicants. However, some performed at a level so subpar that it felt like they were different people from their audition tapes.

Surely, when filming the tape audition, they must have maintained their best condition and re-recorded the video until there were no mistakes. But the stage is a live performance.

Twang!

The pitch was off. It was proof that too much force was being applied to the finger pressing the string.

On stage, even a single mistake couldn't be forgiven. Moreover, the maestros sitting in the judges' seats didn’t miss even the smallest mistakes of the participants.

How many days had they faced such mistakes from the violinists?

"Next."

The expressions of the violinists coming off the stage were uniform. Their shoulders drooped infinitely, and their faces showed unmistakable signs of self-reproach and disappointment.

How did the judges feel? It was a continuous feeling of dissatisfaction, like drinking flat cola. Just then,

"Participant number 71."

Anna, with her platinum blonde hair flowing, stepped onto the stage.

She was already a renowned prodigy at the Moscow Conservatory. Moreover, wasn’t she the girl who made it to the final 12 of the Queen Elisabeth Competition seven years ago? Back then, she was the youngest, aside from Kang Hyun.

The Chinese maestro, Deng Lun, who was a judge seven years ago, as well as Hirose, and even Victor, leaned forward in anticipation of Anna's performance.

Anna took a deep breath and positioned herself gracefully like flowing water.

Paganini Caprice No. 24.

Who would have thought she’d choose this piece? It was a piece that encompassed numerous techniques. Considering Anna’s usual temperament, it wasn’t a piece she was closely associated with.

But as the piece began, Anna’s eyes changed as if it was a lie. Parallel octaves, arpeggios, high positions, rapid passages, pizzicato—a seamless succession of techniques.

The bowing was fierce as if she wouldn’t miss a single 32nd note. Her long, white fingers pressed the strings skillfully, like a spider gliding over them.

An exclamation of admiration escaped from Hugo sitting next to him.

‘She has grown a lot.’

Kang Hyun’s eyes were evidently moved. It was similar to the feelings of a parent looking at their grown child.

It was a performance on a different level from seven years ago at the Queen Elisabeth Competition.

There was no longer a shy, nervous young girl. Her platinum blonde hair fluttered in the wind, and her green eyes expanded her presence confidently.

When the performance ended and the bow was lowered to the floor, none of the judges spoke first.

That was proof that everyone was deeply moved. Unlike other participants, Anna confidently exited the stage.

"It was a truly excellent performance."

Starting with Hugo,

"The recommendation letter from the director of the Moscow Conservatory hinted at it, but I didn’t expect this level. It felt like seeing a rare gem after a long time."

"Unless there’s a major surprise, this participant Anna might win this year."

"Indeed, she is a student raised by Alexei. Her performance was on a completely different level from other participants."

The judges continued to share their opinions. Rather than pointing out mistakes, it was like a moment of being an audience member and savoring the lingering emotions of the stage. It was a scene unseen in the previous final stages.

"Finally, it feels like my eyes are cleansed."

Even Victor couldn’t hide his pleasant expression. At that moment, Victor, who happened to meet Kang Hyun’s eyes, narrowed his brows and turned his head away sharply as if he had seen enough.

Victor seemed to blame Kang Hyun for them being together. In reality, it was just that the two youngest judges were assigned together.

That was when,

"Participant number 72."

Another participant stepped onto the stage. Most of the judges seemed not to expect much, perhaps because it was the performance following Anna’s. Understandably, it was still a short time to shake off the lingering emotions from Anna’s performance.

But then, Hirose’s eyes sparkled, and she leaned forward. Kang Hyun realized it only when he saw the presence on stage.

Sabrina.

With her white hair, Sabrina had a presence that naturally drew attention.

Moreover, she was distinctly different from other participants. Her face showed an evident sense of ease, as if she had swallowed the word "nervous."

Kang Hyun chuckled at her appearance. And he instinctively felt it. Once Sabrina’s performance began, the judges would again be deeply absorbed in the lingering emotions.

The final stage that lasted for fifteen days ended. Anna looked down at the calluses on her hands. They were proof that the past seven years had not been in vain.

"It looks the same as always."

Anna smiled as she looked at Chapelle, known as the Dawn of Melodies. Chapelle, unchanged from seven years ago, was still brimming with mysterious beauty.

She had yet to greet the other eleven violinists. Anna walked around Chapelle, recalling past memories.

"Right, here back then..."

Anna stopped in the kitchen, as memories from the past came to mind.

It was when she headed to the kitchen, hungry in the middle of the night. Anna, intending to eat toast with butter, saw two dim figures in front of her. Under the soft light from the refrigerator, a man and a woman were hugging each other.

"Pfft."

Whenever she thought about that moment, laughter would burst out unintentionally. The one who made eye contact with Anna, who was small at the time, was none other than Kang Hyun.

Come to think of it, how was William doing? Rumor had it that he was touring Europe, holding concerts.

As she was deeply immersed in past memories and walking,

Buzz.

Anna turned her head at the unexpected melody. It was coming from the garden of Chapelle. The twelve violinists hadn’t all gathered yet. Who could be playing?

Anna walked as if drawn by the music. Someone was playing a violin, accompanied by occasional insect sounds and the wind.

Buzz.

The sound was so sweet that Anna gulped without realizing it.

Under the warm sunlight of Chapelle, someone was barefoot, stepping on the grass.

The sight of them playing the violin was so beautiful that Anna was mesmerized. She unconsciously spoke,

"Hyun?"

It was because it felt similar to when she encountered Hyun playing the violin under the dawn in the past.

But the one who lowered the bow and turned their head was none other than a girl with white hair.

"Mr. Hyun, how do you feel about being invited as the youngest judge?"

Belgium's national broadcaster was making a documentary on the Queen Elisabeth Competition. The PD was conducting interviews not only with the participants of Chapelle but also with the judges.

This time, it was Kang Hyun’s turn. With a faint smile, Kang Hyun replied,

"At first, I felt overwhelmed sitting in such an esteemed position."

"Do you feel differently now?"

"As a judge with significant responsibility, I can’t afford to be nervous anymore. I'm doing my best to ensure I don’t let down the participants and other judges."

The PD, with his pronounced features, nodded and continued his questions.

"Mr. Hyun, you won the Queen Elisabeth Competition as the youngest seven years ago and have now become the youngest judge. How would you compare the competition then and now?"

"Back then, many outstanding violinists participated in the competition. This year, too, there are many talented participants. If I had to compare, unfortunately, I'd have to favor seven years ago."

"Is there a reason for that?"

"This year, I’m not one of the participants, am I?"

The PD smiled at Kang Hyun’s joke. Indeed, Kang Hyun was different from the other judges. Not only did he respond to the dreary interview with ease, but he also had a knack for broadcasting. Wasn’t he the one who captivated countless Americans with his wit on the Ellen Show?

"Who do you think is the most likely to win this year?"

"The twelve violinists selected for Chapelle, known as the Dawn of Melodies, all possess exceptional skills. It’s hard to single out one as outstanding."

"What if you were one of the twelve participants?"

Kang Hyun answered with a smile. Then the PD, as if remembering something, spoke,

"Oh, I heard the judges are also staying in the mansion with the participants for eight days. There’s a rumor that two of the judges will be roommates. Is that true?"

Where did they get such information?

"Yes, it’s true."

"Rumor has it that you and the Russian maestro Victor are roommates. Is that correct?"

"Yes, that’s correct."

The PD gave a meaningful smile. It seemed they had found a satisfactory scene to capture for the documentary, as the eight days at Chapelle would also be filmed.

The PD likely knew how difficult Victor's temperament was.

"Living with Victor might cause some trouble. Are you close enough to handle that?"

Was it fair to say they were close? To be precise, they were assigned the same room because they weren’t close. But he couldn’t let the PD steer the conversation as he wished. Kang Hyun responded with another smile.

"If you had the chance to room with another judge instead of Victor, what would you do?"

"I’d still prefer to room with Victor."

Wasn’t it already a done deal? Saying he didn’t like Victor now wouldn’t do any good.

But did Kang Hyun know? That in the future, he would be cited in Korean media as being closest to the Russian maestro Victor among the judges.
