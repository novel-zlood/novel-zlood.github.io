"-The release timing is not good.

The investors' evaluation was sharp.

-We are at a point where blockbuster films are flooding the market.

-Of course, I've heard that director Philip's disaster movie will also be released at the same time.

-No matter how entertaining it is, it's still a music movie, isn't it?

No matter how much of a masterpiece it was, the commercial viability of music-themed movies was clearly limited at that time. There were many suggestions to delay the release, just like hiding from a storm.

However, director Jean-Pierre firmly shook his head.

“It’s not too late to decide after seeing the reactions from critics and journalists at the preview.”

There was a firm belief in Jean-Pierre's eyes. Attending the preview were critics, journalists, and unusually, professors from Juilliard School of Music.

However, the number of attendees was conspicuously low compared to other previews.

The reason was simple. Although Jean-Pierre had gained recognition for the artistic quality of his debut film "La Vie en Rose," he had yet to be acknowledged for its commercial success.

Most of the critics and journalists had likely headed to the previews of the blockbuster films scheduled at the same time.

“I hope you have an enjoyable time.”

Since it was a technical preview combined with a press screening, the stage greeting was brief.

The faces of the journalists, who had not held high expectations, began to change as soon as the film started.

Zzing.

Everyone caught their breath at the sound of Paganini's bow. The film's immersion and grip were on par with, if not superior to, those of blockbusters.

It gave a different kind of thrill. Throughout the screening, the eyes of the journalists and critics never left the screen.

The reaction from the Juilliard professors was the same. Initially, they might have thought it was arrogant to make a music film about Paganini.

Who could dare to revive Paganini's melodies? However,

Gulp―!

If Paganini were alive, he would have presented such melodies. The throats of the Juilliard professors visibly moved in response.

Until the last credit rolled, no one in the audience could rise from their seats.

Everyone in the audience must have felt it simultaneously. This film would be a huge hit. Both the journalists and critics, as well as the Juilliard professors, had many questions for Jean-Pierre.

Eventually, an elderly professor from Juilliard was the first to speak.

“Director, how did you restore Paganini's melodies?”

Was it a rash question? The name Paganini was heavy even to mention among musicians. However, the same curiosity was evident in the eyes of the other professors.

Jean-Pierre, recalling the making-of film, responded.

“It’s simple.”

“Pardon?”

“Because young Paganini himself played it.”

Surely, once they saw the making-of film, they would experience another wave of chills.

“Ajumma, isn’t this soup too bland?”

How could she not realize that her own taste was salty? The housekeeper kept apologizing to my aunt who was complaining.

It was a scene that made me frown. If my grandfather were healthy, he would have hit my aunt on the forehead with a ladle.

“Jinseok hyung.”

“Huh?”

“How long will you keep coming to Ichon-dong?”

I asked after finishing the meal and calling Yoo Jinseok over. But the response was absent.

Of course, how could this young kid know? He was just a puppet moving as his parents told him to.

By the way, my aunt and uncle, as well as my other uncle and his wife, seemed to visit Ichon-dong a few times a week like clockwork.

'Tsk.'

They must be scared that my grandfather might suddenly wake up.

However, as the weeks passed with no improvement in my grandfather's condition, my aunt and uncle seemed more relieved.

Now they seemed to be having a strategy meeting in the living room about what to do next.

My father had already made a fuss once, but it had little effect. At that moment,

“Hyunja, you come here too for a moment.”

My aunt was calling my mother who was in the kitchen. It was just when my father had left his seat. I had to fill in for him. But the looks from my aunt and uncle were not pleasant.

“Hyunja, isn’t it hard to take care of father?”

“Right, Hyunja, it makes us feel bad to see you taking care of everything alone.”

“I’ll send a caregiver when I have time. Hyunja, you should take a break now. And when you have time, go out and have fun with Kang. Kang seems to look pale from always being at work.”

Oh, look at that?

Their lines came out as if they had practiced them. Since when did they care so much about their youngest sibling?

Their intention to hire a caregiver was also clear. They wanted to plant their person in Ichon-dong to monitor every move.

They were becoming more and more audacious. If my grandfather were in good health, they wouldn’t be able to come and go from Ichon-dong at their will.

At that moment,

“Unnie and oppa, don’t you think you’re being too much?”

My mother was angry. There was no need to explain why she was angry. Even if she didn’t know much about the world, she couldn’t be unaware of my aunt and uncle’s dark motives.

“Do you really care about father?”

“No, Hyunja. Don’t you understand our feelings? We are suggesting a caregiver because we worry about you, and now you’re overreacting, making us look bad!”

“If it weren’t for little oppa, father wouldn’t have collapsed in the first place. If he had any shame, he would at least look sorry, but every time he comes to Ichon-dong, he talks about father passing away―!”

It was the first time in my life I had seen my mother get so angry. The saying that if a woman holds a grudge, there will be frost even in May fit perfectly. My mother’s eyes were colder than ever.

Of course, she was the child my grandfather loved the most. My mother, firmly refusing the caregiver, stood up, making them wear awkward expressions.

“Jinseok.”

I went upstairs and called Yoo Jinseok. Ever since he got a beating from me, he had always been afraid of me. Now, speaking informally to him, he looked even more intimidated.

But who am I? I had been a prosecutor for a long time and even prepared to become a congressman. Handling people was something I had been doing all my life. How could I not handle this young kid?

“You have to be my eyes.”

First, I had to plant a black box among that lot.

“America?”

Kim Sang-guk looked puzzled. He hadn’t expected his first business trip to come so soon. Moreover, to America out of the blue was quite surprising.

“You’re going with me.”

“Going with you?”

“We were invited to a film premiere in America. Didn’t I mention it? I participated in the simultaneous recording of a music film around this time last year.”

He still seemed puzzled.

“Weren’t you supposed to be making a lot of money?”

“I need to make a lot of money.”

“Then why go to America? It can’t just be for the premiere. If it’s about investment, you could go alone.”

He was right. It was obvious that with my young appearance, I would be rejected if I went to seek investment. No matter how much Americans valued money, appearances were important.

Who would trust a high school student who wasn’t even a college student? Maybe they would for a movie.

Moreover, I didn’t have enough money for investment yet.

“Mr. Kim, you know exactly how much I own, right?”

“I handle accounting at the gallery as well. I have a rough idea. Do you want the exact amount?”

“No, I already know.”

For my age, it was a considerable amount, enough to be called a fortune. Copyright royalties had been quite substantial.

And what about ticket power? If I held another solo concert, it would sell out even faster than before.

But.

“It’s not enough.”

Dongju Chemicals was already a leading company in the chemical industry. Moreover, with the development speed and value of graphene increasing every day,

In other words, it was a continuously rising stock. So, my current assets were far from enough. It was like trying to catch a running train.

But there was a way.

“The war has begun, so now I need to make bullets.”

“I’m curious about your plan.”

Calling it bullets was an understatement, but I had no choice. I couldn’t reveal the exact amount here.

If my memory of my past life was correct, it would be the next round. It was an incident so frequently covered in newspapers and topics that I couldn’t forget.

How could I remember it so vividly? Isn’t software tremendously advanced? To exaggerate, I could even remember the number of anchovies I had for lunch.

“I have the first method to make a lump sum of money.”

* * *

The grand house in Pyeongchang-dong, surrounded by red walls like a fortress, was bustling early in the morning with people planting garden trees.

Just like the country club in Gapyeong, Chairman Wang spared no expense in buying old trees and landscaping trees. It was said that the cost of the landscaping trees in the Pyeongchang-dong mansion was more than that of an average house.

“Father, aren’t you going to Ichon-dong today?”

“I went yesterday. Today I’ll just enjoy the view of the palm trees.”

“Chairman Yoo is still unwell, right?”

Chairman Wang nodded silently. In reality, he had spent time yesterday catching up on old conversations, losing track of time.

It was said that only the housekeeper knew, and the children didn’t know at all.

At that moment, a man in a suit walked up beyond the garden.

“You’re here, Manager Kim.”

“Hello, Manager Kim.”

Kim Sang-guk bowed to Chairman Wang first and then greeted Im Hyera.

With the perceptive Im Hyera stepping aside, Chairman Wang walked among the landscaping trees. To talk discreetly, this much was necessary.

Looking at the dense landscaping trees, it felt like being in an arboretum.

“Manager Kim, how was it seeing Hyun?”

“He didn’t waver no matter what wind blew.”

“Didn’t waver?”

Kim Sang-guk nodded without hesitation.

As the saying goes, you can tell a lot by a little, the more he talked with Kang Hyun, the more Kim Sang-guk couldn’t hide his amazement.

Sometimes it didn’t feel like talking to a seventeen-year-old but rather to someone of his own age or even an older veteran.

“Chairman, this may be presumptuous, but as a manager in the Strategic Planning Office, I’ve met many people. Of course, compared to you, it’s nothing, but I thought I knew how to read people. But meeting Kang Hyun made me realize it was a vain arrogance.”

As the saying goes, there’s always someone better. This fit Kang Hyun perfectly.

Among the people he had seen in the Strategic Planning Office, Kang Hyun’s planning and driving power were the best. Moreover, his ideas were extraordinary.

“Going to America?”

“Yes, Chairman.”

“Why America all of a sudden?”

It made sense if it was for a movie premiere, but the timing wasn’t right. If it were for investment issues, he could just send Kim Sang-guk alone.

However, Kim Sang-guk hesitated to speak and then started.

“Actually, Kang Hyun had another condition.”

“A condition?”

“He said it’s okay to report minor conversations or impressions with him, but he wants us to keep the contract and business details confidential.”

At that moment, Chairman Wang burst into laughter. His laughter was so hearty that the palm tree leaves seemed to dance and sway.

It was as if Kang Hyun’s words were aimed at him. Despite his young age, Kang Hyun was trying to make Kim Sang-guk his own person, step by step.

Chairman Wang, without asking further, turned his head to look at the landscaping trees.

“Looking at these palm trees, I think of Hyun. Do you know the flower language of the palm tree?”

Since it was a tree imported from abroad, its flowers bloomed late. Moreover, it was difficult to grow in Seoul, but Chairman Wang had managed to grow it with added lighting. Looking at the palm tree flowers that bloomed with much effort, Chairman Wang added a word.

“Seizing.”

Chairman Wang, with a peculiar smile, walked away, curious about how far the boy’s hands could reach."
