"Here you are, Maestro."

Spencer looked up at the sudden voice.

"May I sit next to you for a moment?"

"Do as you please."

Prince Samuel of England slowly sat next to Spencer.

Usually, the London Symphony Concert Hall was packed with people. But now, as the whole of England was buzzing with the festival, the concert hall was on a break.

The empty seats were occupied only by Spencer and Samuel.

"What are you doing here so gloomily while everyone else is enjoying the festival?"

"I was reminiscing. By the way, is it okay for the Prince to be moving around without any bodyguards, or have you aged enough that you no longer need them?"

Samuel smiled and looked at his old friend. Spencer surely knew that the bodyguards were waiting outside.

However, Spencer was the only friend he could be unpretentious with. When he was with Spencer, he could momentarily forget the formalities of the royal family.

"Spencer, if I were younger, I would have put a headlock on you right now."

"It seems the Prince has forgotten, perhaps because you've been heir to the throne for too long. Don’t you remember the time we fought in the bathroom during our Royal School days? If I recall correctly, you had a nosebleed then."

"Ahem. If it had gone to the end, I would have won; the dorm master saved you."

At that moment, Spencer and Samuel looked at each other and burst into hearty laughter. Thinking back, nothing had changed between the two since their Royal School days to their middle age.

"Spencer, what were you reminiscing about?"

"I was thinking back on the years I spent at the London Symphony. From the first time I held the conductor's baton to being appointed as the principal conductor and meeting the wonderful members I would never encounter again in my life. I was letting the panorama of my life pass by."

"To think the great Spencer would be so sentimental! Anyone hearing this might think you're about to retire tomorrow."

Spencer gave a silent, peculiar smile. He knew that his shoulder wasn’t in great shape. Hadn’t his doctor also said that even if the shoulder surgery went well, he might find it hard to conduct again?

"At most, I have a few years left. During that time, my shoulder will have to hold up until the new Maestro of the London Symphony is settled."

"Are you talking about Hyun?"

"Of course, isn't it obvious? The lion of Berlin is aiming for Hyun, but that's nonsense! But the most important thing is what Hyun wants."

In a way, Samuel was the one who connected Spencer with Hyun. Wasn't it Samuel who first showed Hyun to Spencer?

He knew why Spencer was so concerned. It was because Kang Hyun's personality was unpredictable for a child.

"Don't worry, Spencer. You have a very strong ally besides yourself."

"Ally?"

At that moment, Prince Samuel of England twitched his cheek.

"The Queen is a fervent fan of Hyun."

* * *

Mud-stained boots and pants were covered with muddy water. The green apron and wide-brimmed straw hat over the plain clothes made her look like an unmistakable gardener. It was quite different from the Queen's attire seen at royal performances.

But her deep gaze seemed to pierce through one’s soul.

"Do you have a moment?"

"Yes, absolutely!"

I replied with an overly raised tone as if I were a new employee in front of a direct superior. The Queen smiled kindly at this sight.

The Queen put down her trowel and led me into the greenhouse.

The scent that wafted through the slightly ajar door was nothing compared to the rich and deep floral fragrance that greeted me as soon as I stepped inside.

Various flowers flaunted their colors like a painting. If there is a paradise of flowers, it must look like this.

"It's a tea called Rose Queen. Its soft and rich flavor lingers in your mouth, leaving a good memory. Just like Hyun's symphony."

I couldn't tell if the tea was going into my mouth or my nose. Who would have imagined enjoying tea time face-to-face with the Queen of England?

Every time my gaze met the Queen's blue eyes, it felt as if my thoughts were being read.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Of course, Your Majesty."

"What do you think music is, Hyun? With your talent at such a young age, I'm curious about your perspective on music."

It was a difficult question. I had never thought separately about music. I didn’t make music with a clear philosophy or ideology.

It just flowed as if fate had chosen me. But if I were to express music in one sentence, there was no need to hesitate.

"I think it's happiness."

Hadn't I vowed not to dwell on the past failures of my previous life? I pursued only happiness, shaking off power and greed.

In a way, music might be the train running toward the destination called happiness. The Queen smiled faintly at the unexpected answer.

"I ascended to Buckingham at a rather young age and wore the crown. At first, I was extremely nervous about standing in front of people. You wouldn't believe it, but I didn't like being the Queen. It wasn’t a position I ascended to by choice. But as time passed, I realized at some point that this was the path I had to take. In that sense, I think you, Hyun, will become a great musician. You are walking a path with such a firm belief already."

It was high praise. In my past life, I had lived only for success and had never heard such words from anyone. Then the Queen put down her teacup and looked at me.

"I'll make a straightforward proposal. Do you have any thoughts of coming to England, Hyun?"

"Pardon?"

"I’m not asking you to decide anything right now. But I want to open a path for you to study music in England after you become an adult. If you wish, I will guarantee citizenship and ensure all conveniences for your relocation. I want the melody of the London Symphony to be reborn through your hands, just as Maestro Spencer did in the past."

I wasn't this surprised even when I heard I passed the bar exam. Who would have thought the Queen of England would make such a proposal directly?

Moreover, it wasn’t even for right now but for after I became an adult.

At first, I thought I had misheard, but the Queen's piercing gaze was not lying.

When I couldn’t easily respond to the sudden proposal, the Queen gave a short nod.

"Take your time to think about it. England will always be waiting for your conducting. By the way, do you know that this place is called the Magic Garden?"

"It's the first time I’ve heard the name of the garden."

"Tending to various flowers and trees is my small hobby. I’ve called this place the Magic Garden since I was a child. Not only does it soothe the mind, but—"

Her pure white hair swayed as she pointed to the garden.

"It’s a mysterious place where anything you wish for comes true."

"Honey, why are you so excited?"

Kang Hyun's father, Kang Sunwoo, was struggling to calm his wife over the phone.

Normally, a person who remained unflappable no matter what happened was now as excited as someone who had won the lottery.

"Honey, I received a call from England."

"Hyun? I talked to him yesterday, so what’s the big deal?"

"No, not from our son, but from the British royal family!"

Kang Sunwoo's face changed by the second as he listened to the story coming through the receiver. It was enough to make Dr. Tikhonov, who was sitting across from him, look puzzled.

The reason Kang Sunwoo's eyes grew as big as saucers was this: the Queen of England had directly invited them.

"Wait a minute. Honey."

The excited voice was still coming through the receiver. Meanwhile, Kang Sunwoo's face was filled with both joy and tension. After all, it was an invitation to a national event.

Not to mention, the Queen of England had personally sent the invitation.

"Does your father-in-law know?"

"Of course, he knows. Father has also been invited. My hands trembled when the Queen herself called."

"What? The Queen directly?"

Kang Sunwoo unknowingly raised his voice and stood up. Dr. Tikhonov, who was sitting across from him, now raised an eyebrow and repeatedly said "Queen?" in his now-familiar Korean pronunciation.

Sending a glance that he would explain the situation later, Kang Sunwoo gripped the phone tighter.

"Although the call was through an interpreter, I couldn’t understand a thing. I ended up asking about her hobbies, thinking I might bring a gift."

"You asked about her hobbies?"

"Yes, and she laughed, saying her hobby is gardening."

Of course, she was the Queen of a country. It was impossible to prepare a gift for her, as she would already have everything. Yet his wife was seriously contemplating it.

In a way, it was her bright and kind nature, despite being born into a wealthy family, that made him fall in love with her.

Then, a determined voice came through the receiver.

"Honey, since the Queen likes gardening, how about we prepare a hoe as a gift?"

Oh no, it felt like cold water was being poured over his head. That’s something England probably doesn’t have.

* * *

"Just one week left."

Somehow, I was handling a schedule in England as busy as that of a popular celebrity. After the royal performance, there were many people wanting to meet me, so it couldn't be helped.

Most of them were musicians with a great interest in music, so there was no reason for me not to meet them.

"Chrissy, how about I prepare dinner tonight?"

"If Hyun is cooking, I'm looking forward to it."

"How about spicy braised chicken like last time, with sikhye for dessert? I saw sikhye being sold at the Korean mart."

Chrissy was already addicted to my cooking. I had occasionally made simple Korean dishes since my previous visit to England.

So, although she initially declined, Chrissy now loved Korean food almost as much as a native Korean. She even pestered me for recipes like she did back at the chapel.

"Hyun, sometimes I mistake you for someone older."

"Me?"

"Yes, sometimes you look like a typical boy of your age, but when you care for me so kindly, it’s a level of consideration that someone your age wouldn’t normally think of. I'm always grateful for that. I will do my best to protect you."

What a touching statement that made my nose tingle. Chrissy finished speaking and quickly put on her sunglasses, seemingly embarrassed. This added credence to the belief that muscular guys with macho vibes have a lot of sensitivity.

"Chrissy, is it okay if I go for a walk? After the walk, I’ll head straight to the Korean mart to prepare dinner. Let the chef know in advance."

Chrissy was now accustomed to my routine.

Of course, it was a royal-owned mansion.

A few days ago, while wandering in the Magic Garden where I had met the Queen, emotions welled up deep within my heart.

One would think I would be past the age for homesickness, but my body wasn’t. Sometimes, I missed my parents and grandfather.

"A place where any wish comes true, huh."

The Queen's last words echoed in my mind. It was a fitting phrase for the Magic Garden, after all. The scent of the flowers wafted gently, soothing my heart. Then it happened.

Huh?

I rubbed my eyes with my sleeve several times. Strangely, I saw a hallucination despite not having a pollen allergy. People I missed were walking together beyond the garden. But as the figures became clearer, my eyes widened.

"Son!"
