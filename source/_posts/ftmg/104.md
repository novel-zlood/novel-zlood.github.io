"강현 학생, 아침 먹어요."

With a towel wrapped around my neck, I went downstairs to the first floor, where a savory smell tickled my nose.

I also saw Dr. Tikhonov, whose presence I had become accustomed to. As always, he was wearing an apron.

"Boss, today's breakfast is traditional Russian cuisine. I call it 'The Dawn of Vladivostok.'"

The table was set with a soup made from salmon and flounder, crepes with cream cheese, and sweet and slightly bitter pomegranate juice. Russia was spread out on the table.

Even though no one asked him to, Dr. Tikhonov liked to cook and serve the meals himself. I tried to dissuade him, but what could I do? He was stubborn. In Russia, they say it's a gesture of gratitude to prepare heartfelt meals for those they care about.

"Thank you for always preparing these meals, Doctor."

As breakfast was coming to an end, Dr. Tikhonov suddenly looked at me.

"Hyun, you seem to have grown a bit taller?"

It was a welcome observation. Dr. Tikhonov had quite an eye. I had already noticed my fingers getting longer when playing the violin. I had memories of my fingers bleeding while playing Caprice in the past because they were too short.

Breakfast tasted particularly good today.

"We've arrived, Kang Hyun."

It was the start of a new school term. With the help of Mr. Kim, the driver, I arrived at Jeil High School, which was similar to Jeil Middle School. Well, it was under the same Jeil Foundation, so it was to be expected.

As I entered the classroom, I felt the students' gazes focusing on me. I pretended not to notice and sat in any available seat.

"Hyun-ah."

At that moment, a familiar face approached, acting as if he knew me. It was Lee Jin-ho, who had been the concertmaster at our last graduation ceremony.

It seemed we were in the same class. Jin-ho had a brighter smile on his face than ever.

But from earlier, girls from other classes and grades were passing by our class and glancing in.

"They're all here to see you, Hyun."

"Me?"

"You've always been famous, but after the graduation ceremony, you became even more popular. I heard you even have a fan club now."

I had a feeling that school life wouldn't be smooth sailing.

Just then, the school gate opened, and a burly middle-aged man entered. With a stern look, he scanned the room and wrote his name on the blackboard.

As usual, after the homeroom teacher's introduction, the students started talking among themselves.

"Kang Hyun."

The homeroom teacher called me. Without a word, I stood up and followed him, hearing whispers behind me.

The place we arrived at was none other than the principal's office. As I entered, the rotund principal rushed out to greet me.

"Oh my, Kang Hyun―!"

To anyone watching, it would seem like he had known me for a long time.

It seemed Im Hyera's influence was at play. Even at the Jeil Middle School graduation ceremony, Chairman Wang had personally attended. It made sense that the principal was sweating and nervous. At that moment.

"Kang Hyun, can you give the welcome speech at the entrance ceremony?"

"What?"

"As you know, our Jeil High School holds the entrance ceremony after the school term starts. I'd like you to give the welcome speech as the representative of the new students and as a famous violinist. You did an excellent job with the graduation speech, so I believe you'll do well."

It felt like I was becoming a specialist in giving speeches.

"Mi-hyun noona, you seem busy."

The gallery was bustling with work. New paintings were flooding in, making the staff work hard.

That was understandable, as each piece ranged from hundreds of millions to tens of billions of won in modern art, so even a small mistake in displaying them was unacceptable.

"Hyun-ah, your uniform has changed. And you look a bit taller too."

"Today was the first day of the new school term."

"You seem to get more handsome by the day, Hyun. New visitors to our gallery often ask if you're an aspiring actor."

Mi-hyun noona approached me as she found a moment to catch her breath.

When I first met her, she looked like a very young and inexperienced employee, but now she exuded the aura of a career woman.

She hadn't forgotten the help I had given her, so she treated me with particular warmth.

"Hyun-ah, can you guess which of these artworks is the most expensive?"

At first glance, all the paintings looked similar. There was one depicting a farmer and another reflecting a city by the river.

But the painting I pointed to was none other than a white canvas with a single blue dot.

"How did you know?"

Would you believe that this painting would be worth tens of billions of won in the future? How did I know? Because it was a painting I had seen while working under Im Hyera.

Then I waved my hand silently and headed to the studio.

"Mozart, Brahms, Beethoven, Sarasate..."

There were countless repertoires suitable for a solo recital. Each one was a feast of excellent pieces.

But Maestro Gustav's interview lingered in my mind like a fishbone. He had said he wanted to see a solo recital by violinist Hyun.

At that moment.

"Hyun-ah, I knew you’d be here."

Im Hyera appeared in the studio, her smile broad. The reason was simple. I had decided to hold a solo recital.

"What are you so worried about?"

"It's my first solo recital. I can't help but be concerned about the repertoire."

"I'm not as knowledgeable about music as you are, but do you really need to use someone else's compositions? Take a look at the scores you've written. If you write a bit more, you could build a tower with them."

Over the past three years, I had written countless scores. But I wondered if it was okay to bring them out into the world. To me, they still seemed far from perfect.

"By the way, who do you think should play the piano? Even for a solo recital, you need an accompanist. If there's a pianist you want, I'll do my best to get them."

"It's okay. I've already found one."

"What?"

Given that there was still plenty of time before the recital, she probably didn't expect me to have found someone so quickly. Just as Im Hyera was about to speak.

"Hyun-ah―!"

It seemed like he couldn't help it. Baek Jung-hoon entered the studio.

"Maestro, violinist Hyun is holding a solo recital."

A faint smile appeared on the wrinkled lips.

"May I ask why you're so eager to see violinist Hyun's solo recital? Honestly, I thought you would mention Heifetz's performance."

Adam couldn't understand. No matter how skilled the violinist was, wasn't he still a newcomer?

He had expected the Maestro to say he wanted to hear Heifetz's performance again. After all, they had been rivals until Heifetz's death.

"I listened to Heifetz's performances to the point of exhaustion when I was younger. I secretly attended his recitals more than once. I didn't want anyone to know because I was filled with envy. But at some point, his performances started to delight my ears. Eventually, I had to acknowledge him. You asked why I didn't choose Heifetz's recital as the one I most wanted to see again?"

The teacup with flower petals shook.

"I've already lived a long life. I don't have much time left. What's the point of listening to Heifetz's performance again after I'm dead? I should listen to it while he's alive, shouldn't I?"

"Maestro, are you saying that you think violinist Hyun is on par with Heifetz?"

"With time, he will surely reach that level. He might even surpass him."

Adam was at a loss for words. He knew how significant Heifetz's name was in the world of violin.

If the 19th century was known as Paganini's era, the 20th century was often called Heifetz's era.

Yet, Gustav confidently said that Kang Hyun would surpass Heifetz. It was a shock to Adam.

"Heifetz gave me a violin. He played it for a long time. When he passed away, he told me, 'My old friend Gustav, if you ever find someone who can play this violin, give it to them without hesitation. If not, burn it and scatter the ashes over my grave.'"

At that moment, the butler brought an old violin.

"Sometimes, to not forget the melody, I play it. And every time, it cries out, 'Why haven't you found a virtuoso to play me yet?' Perhaps this trip to Korea will help me find its owner."

Adam gulped hard. The strings exuded a palpable aura that was hard to miss.

"Hyung, can I try it one more time?"

Baek Jung-hoon nodded at my question. We had been practicing for so long that a day and a half had passed.

In a violin solo recital, the role of the piano is significant. If the ensemble isn't in sync, the entire performance can fall apart.

In that sense, Baek Jung-hoon was the best accompanist for me.

"Let's start from the second movement."

Even though we paused and restarted, there was no complaint. It showed how much he trusted me.

We paused for a break.

"Hyun-ah, if this continues, your solo recital will be sensational. I've never seen a violinist hold their first solo recital with their compositions. If this gets released as an album, it'll be a hit."

Baek Jung-hoon kept praising my scores. But to me, they still seemed lacking.

"Hyung, let's start from the beginning again."

Baek Jung-hoon smiled knowingly and took his place at the piano.

The moonlight streamed through the window, and the melodies flowed ceaselessly.

"Hyun-ah, did you stay up all night again?"

Im Hyera entered the studio, her mouth agape. The synthesizer was cluttered with scores, and Baek Jung-hoon was sleeping curled up on the sofa.

Preparing for the solo recital meant practicing day and night, especially on weekends.

"Is it okay for Jung-hoon to stay here like this?"

Baek Jung-hoon had started showing up regularly again.

When I asked him to accompany me, he readily agreed. It was as if he was preparing for his own recital, showing such enthusiasm that it made me feel burdened.

"I thought you'd be in Ichon-dong, so I sent something there."

"What did you send?"

Im Hyera gave a mysterious smile. I shook my head, puzzled, and woke up Baek Jung-hoon.

After shaking him a few times, Baek Jung-hoon woke up in a hurry. His mouth was wet with saliva, indicating he had slept deeply.

"Hyung, let's go have breakfast."

Normally, I would have breakfast at the gallery, but Im Hyera insisted we have it in Ichon-dong.

Baek Jung-hoon was visiting Ichon-dong for the first time.

"Hyun-ah, isn't it rude to visit the elders so suddenly in the morning?"

"I already called them. Grandpa said the more, the merrier."

After all, Dr. Tikhonov also shared meals with us. One more person wouldn't be a problem.

"Huh?"

When we entered the Ichon-dong residence, I heard a familiar voice as we approached the kitchen. Baek Jung-hoon was cautiously following me.

"Yooha?"
