Gulp―!

Lia's throat bobbed noticeably. Her eyes were bloodshot, but her gaze never left the VCR for even a moment. Day turned into night, and she had been sitting in the editing room for hours.

Documentaries typically require scenes to be edited and some to be highlighted. But...

"It's so interesting."

That was the problem. The daily life in the chapel was filmed using an observation camera. In the past, there was nothing noteworthy, which was a concern. Since it involved sensitive musicians, all the camera captured was them playing the violin day and night, with no interaction.

But this time was different.

"Jjim, jjimdak?"

Wasn't it like watching a high-teen drama? Of course, Kang Hyun was at the center of that drama without a doubt.

The boy from the East. Despite his small stature, he had a charisma that captivated everyone. He was as charming when playing the violin as he was otherwise.

Especially the scene where he comforted a crying William made it hard to tell who was the older and who was the younger.

Additionally, Anna from Russia followed Kang Hyun like an oppa. That sight strangely captivated the attention.

'The director was right!'

Experience doesn't come from nowhere. There was a reason they picked an unknown young boy among many newcomers.

As a certain maestro said, if the second-round video is released, the music world would be abuzz, and if the daily life in the chapel was shown, Kang Hyun would draw immense attention. That was when it happened.

Lia's eyes widened.

In the VCR, during the scene where Kang Hyun was adjusting the posture of the violinists, something amazing happened. After the posture was corrected, the sound that followed was subtly different.

In this magical series of events, the other newcomers eagerly asked for his help.

"Huh."

It was such an astonishing scene that even admiration couldn't capture it. These were musicians with strong musical pride, and they were competitors preparing for a contest.

But now, it seemed like everyone was united as one. Through the strings. Gulp.

Who on earth is that boy?

"How did you know?" What should I answer?

Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5.

A symphony I often listened to in my past life, but I had never memorized the score, nor had I seen it.

An orchestra with five strings, including a full orchestra arrangement. Would you believe me? That a momentary dissonance in this multitude of harmonies caught my ear.

When I hesitated to answer, Eden instead gave me a bright smile. "Come down quickly, we need to greet the members."

I hurriedly descended the stairs with my short legs.

"Are you really 14 years old?"

In Korean age, I was 14, so it wasn't a lie. The orchestra members all looked at me with curious eyes. They couldn't have imagined that someone as young as me would make it to the final list. Moreover, hadn't they witnessed an unbelievable scene earlier?

"Hyun, is this your first time collaborating with an orchestra?"

"Yes, Maestro."

Eden looked at me with a peculiar gaze.

"Rather than listening to theories, it's better to experience it firsthand, right? During practice, feel free to express the desired musicality and direction."

When I picked up the score, admiration erupted from all around. Even Eden's eyes reflected that excitement. For a moment, the red curtain bathed in moonlight fluttered.

Collaborating with the orchestra was like a continuous dream. It felt like a grand stream was moving toward me. I was momentarily surprised by the grandeur of the melody, but the bow and strings kept meeting without rest.

"It's amazing, you really resemble someone I know."

Eden looked at me with a gaze that seemed to recall the past.

"What part would you like to correct?"

All the members were skilled, but collaboration was different. The interpretation of the score by the violinist might differ from their own thoughts.

Eden treated me comfortably, so I wouldn't feel burdened, like a beloved grandchild.

I promptly received a red pen and the score from Eden. Then, without hesitation, I suggested corrections for the fifth string part with the red pen.

'Amazing, really.'

I never imagined that the person who would solve the mystery after decades would be so young. Usually, people are busy sharing subjective impressions instead of answers.

Moreover, how was the performance skill? I couldn't take my eyes off the entire time I was conducting. It's a feeling I haven't had in a long time.

"Here it is, Maestro."

The corrected score made Eden doubt his eyes. It pinpointed all the problems he had felt.

It wasn't that the members' pitch was wrong. It was just a difference in interpretation between the orchestra and the violinist.

How could someone so young immediately recognize such things? "Hyun, you are truly gifted."

Even with the talent of a conductor.

The modest appearance of bowing slightly made me doubt his age. What kind of maestro is crouching inside that child's body? I even wondered if the rumor circulating in Brussels was true.

That Mozart had reincarnated.

"How do you feel after a solo recital?"

It's a complex question.

"Is it like a sweet candy melting in your mouth?"

I've been playing the violin for decades, but the feeling at the end of a solo recital remains unchanged. If anything, it feels more intense as time goes by.

I don't know why the desire for endless melody burns more as I get older. Maybe it's because I met that boy.

"Mr. Hirose, there's a rumor that someone in Brussels has received your recommendation. Is it true?"

Hirose nodded briefly without hesitation. At that, Tanaka gulped. It was something that hadn't come up during the previous interview about Brussels.

"Do you know that this person made it to the final list?"

Hirose confirmed with silence.

"And do you know they possess the Stradivarius 'Fantasia'?"

At the mention of 'Fantasia,' Hirose's expression changed. His previously calm eyes shook, showing he was quite surprised. But soon, a faint smile appeared on his lips.

The Stradivarius is a violin with a soul, finding its destined owner through a long journey connected by a red thread.

"Mr. Hirose, after your solo recital, you said you would take a break. What will you do first?"

"I plan to take a flight to Belgium this evening."

Tanaka's eyes widened at the mention of Belgium. The reason she was going to Belgium was all too clear. Now it was time to confirm if the rumors in the classical music world were true.

Tanaka paused for a moment before speaking.

"Mr. Hirose, is the person participating in the Queen Elisabeth Competition your student?"

Has the queen of strings ever taught anyone before? That's why the recommendation letter became a big deal. Moreover, she is heading to Belgium herself. The finals of the Queen Elisabeth Competition are famously open to outsiders.

At that moment, Hirose's white hair swayed. "A friend."

A short but meaningful word.

Eight days is not a long time.

Especially for those who seek endless melodies, it would feel like a fleeting moment. As the final day approached, I realized how close I had become with them.

Instead of preparing for a competition, it felt more like they were preparing for a grand finale, helping each other out. Of course, I was the busiest among them.

"Come on, let's have dinner!"

Eric, who resembled a Viking, shouted cheerfully. It seemed like it was his turn to cook dinner today.

It was probably either salmon or pickled herring again. Those were the usual dishes whenever it was Eric's turn to cook.

Joseph's claim that Eric was a bear in his past life seemed more credible. "Oh? This is."

It was a dark red stew.

"Well, I tried to make jjimdak that Hyun made."

No wonder he wrote down the recipe earlier. The appearance was similar, except the potatoes, carrots, and chicken were cut into large chunks, just like Eric's build. I had to cut the chicken into pieces to eat it properly.

But the taste was pretty good. Maybe it's true that people with big hands are good at cooking? "Anna, why do you look so upset?"

At Daniel's question.

"I got scolded by the maestro because I made a mistake out of nervousness."

Anna answered with her characteristic tearful expression. So, Eden does scold people? I didn't know because he's always smiling.

"Maestro Simeon is known to be strict. They used to call him the red-haired witch when he was young. I also get really nervous when playing the violin in front of him."

It seemed Maestro was stricter than I thought. Even William and Zhang Yan agreed. I looked at Anna's upset face.

"Anna, don't worry too much. You'll do great."

"Th-thank you, Hyun."

Anna nodded firmly. Seeing that, Eric, who was holding a whole chicken leg, added.

"Who is the older one, and who is the younger one?"

After a lively dinner, everyone headed to the practice room to play the violin.

With the final competition just around the corner, everyone was practicing late into the night, reducing their sleep time. Thanks to that, melodies echoed in the chapel day and night.

The full moon was visible.

Rustle, rustle, rustle.

The sound of leaves rubbing together and falling reached my ears.

A cool autumn breeze brushed past my cheeks. At times like this, it felt almost a waste to stay cooped up in the practice room playing the violin.

There was a large garden in front of the chapel, and under the subtle moonlight, the foliage exuded a mysterious aura. I carefully took out my violin.

Under the fluttering full moon,

Jiiing.

The melody of fantasy resonated. Sometimes, the bow and strings met without rest, showcasing rapid playing and dazzling techniques. At times, it was as languid and slow as the breath of a puppy.

Using the sound of wind and insects as accompaniment,

Jiiing―!

When I pressed the strings strongly with the bow, a lively high note rang out, and a fish swimming in the pond leaped.

I could understand why the chapel is called the sanctuary of violinists. It felt like returning to an ancient time when there was nothing, allowing me to focus solely on the melody.

How much time had passed? The twilight was starting to fade. My whole body was drenched as if I had been caught in a downpour.

Isn't your arm tired? Compared to the happiness I felt, it was nothing. Then it happened.

In the blazing dawn,

Click-clack―!

I heard clear footsteps.

Thump thump thump.

A clear horn appeared amidst the mist. The swaying foliage stopped all at once, and the entity slowly revealed itself through the twilight.

It was a white deer. But it radiated such a divine aura that I wondered if I was dreaming.

In the blazing dawn, the pure white deer approached me closely. Its eyes seemed to embody nature, exuding an indescribable energy.

At that moment, when my heart was pounding like crazy,

"Hyun, have you been playing the violin all this time? Outside?"

I heard a voice from behind. When I turned around, Anna was standing there, looking worried. She must have been concerned because I was playing the violin outside all night. But then, what was that deer?

Huh?

When I turned back, the pure white deer was no longer there. Only the fish was leisurely swimming in the pond, and the foliage was swaying as if nothing had happened.

On the last day at the chapel, I encountered another illusion. Like a mirage in a fleeting moment.
