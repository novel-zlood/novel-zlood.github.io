"Boss, your popularity is no joke."

Chief Kim Sang-guk could feel Kang Hyun's popularity even on the plane returning to Korea.

Not only were Kang Hyun's face on the magazines and newspapers placed in the business class, but there were also fans among the passengers.

How did he know? Because they were wearing t-shirts with Kang Hyun's face on them.

'Isn't he becoming a world star at this rate?'

Even Seo Taiji or HOT, who led the end of the 20th century, weren't at this level. They had immense fandom and popularity domestically but couldn't break into the overseas market.

Moreover, isn't it ironic that he's so popular in the U.S. and Europe, not even in the same Asian regions? It was said that a fan club for Kang Hyun had already been established in the UK.

'Life is so unfair.'

Chief Kim Sang-guk recalled a previous meeting with Cotton. He, too, had been through countless ups and downs and was highly regarded among the top talents in the strategic planning department, but persuading the picky Cotton was no easy task.

But what about Kang Hyun? He had a conversation with Cotton for over an hour about the nanotech field, which even he didn't know well.

'When did he study so much?'

It was incomprehensible. Even Cotton, already rumored to be a genius in the nanotech field, was astonished by Kang Hyun's knowledge.

Chief Kim Sang-guk, who watched from the side, felt the same. Anyone who saw it would never think Kang Hyun was a violinist.

'Expand the scale in Korea...'

Kang Hyun's next instruction was simple. It was to expand the scale of VH Company in Korea.

Currently, Chief Kim Sang-guk was operating with a select few elite members he could trust and delegate tasks to.

Compared to the scale of funds handled by investment firms, the number of members was modest.

Kang Hyun added that there would be more work to do at VH Company. In line with that, he thought the company's scale should also expand.

- The documentary featuring violinist Kang Hyun achieved a record-breaking rating of 25.7% in the current affairs and cultural section. K Broadcasting Station decided to increase the rerun schedule, and S Broadcasting Station, a competitor, produced and aired a special episode featuring Kang Hyun's life and performances.

The anchor was talking about Kang Hyun on a huge brown tube TV installed in the airport lobby. People stopped in their tracks and stared at Kang Hyun on the screen.

People love geniuses. Moreover, he was so handsome that he could put movie stars to shame, so the attention was understandable.

Chief Kim Sang-guk felt the same. The difference between the businessman he saw in New York and the violinist was like night and day. He was also curious about what Kang Hyun would be like in ten years.

* * *

"Wow!"

A genuine exclamation escaped Kang Hyun's mouth. It was a spacious, almost palace-like studio. It wasn't surprising since it was a studio he had requested from Director Im Hyera. He knew she was generous, but he didn't expect this much.

"I need to do this right."

He even forgot about the sandwich he had packed for lunch. He wanted to immediately put the musical ideas that came to mind onto the staff and create melodies through the synthesizer.

Other musicians would likely feel the same way if they saw this studio. All the machines available in 2000 were fully equipped. If Tommy saw this place, he would undoubtedly make a fuss, making his freckles fall off.

"Jim Filmer's work is almost done with the first phase."

The work of Director Jim Filmer, which first inspired him, was in the final stages of the first phase. Given that musical ideas kept coming day and night, it was only natural.

But other composers would be amazed at Kang Hyun's workload. Composing all the insert songs for a film certainly wasn't something that could be done in a short period. By the way...

"What about this person?"

Kang Hyun rubbed the bridge of his nose. Cotton had contacted him several times a day.

Was it because of the conversation they had about the nanotech field? Cotton seemed to consider Kang Hyun a genius like himself.

He wanted to tell Cotton everything about the papers he saw in the future, word for word, but how could he? Kang Hyun was unintentionally becoming a mysterious genius. At that moment...

Knock, knock.

With a knock, the door to the studio carefully opened. The only person who knew about this place, besides Director Im Hyera, was...

"Oppa!"

There stood Yooha beyond the studio door, holding an armful of food.

It was reminiscent of the time she brought snacks during the rehearsal for the London Symphony Orchestra concert. She was exceptionally good at taking care of people from such a young age.

"This studio is really spacious."

Yooha was also amazed at the size of the studio. Given that even Kang Hyun was surprised by its size, Yooha's reaction was understandable.

As Yooha looked around the studio, she suddenly widened her eyes and looked at Kang Hyun.

"The only people who know about this spacious studio are you and me!"

She looked delighted, as if she had found a secret space.

"Great, no one will disturb us. We can often have dates here from now on."

Were Yooha's eyes squinting, or was it just my imagination?

* * *

"Yooha, can I ask you a question?"

A girl with a shy smile. When Yooha nodded briefly, she cautiously handed over a math problem she couldn't solve during class.

Yooha was known for being one of the top students at the prestigious Phillips Academy. After solving the problem, the girl hesitated before adding,

"Yooha, do you think Hyun will hold a concert in New York?"

As expected, that was the question.

A hint of annoyance briefly appeared on Son Yooha's face but quickly faded.

Lately, many girls had been trying to get close to her. Normally, even those who wouldn't dare to speak to the icy Son Yooha from Siberia were mustering the courage to talk to her.

All because of Kang Hyun.

"I don't know whether oppa will hold a concert in New York."

"Okay, thanks, Yooha!"

Yooha bit her lip, wondering if she had replied too curtly. At first, she didn't mind her friends' interest, but as time passed, it increasingly annoyed her.

Rumor had it that a fan club related to Kang Hyun had already been established within the school.

"Hyun oppa's lecture was so impressive. Yooha, you have to understand."

It was as if Michelle could read Yooha's mind, comforting her.

Michelle was right. The intellectual prowess he displayed during the lecture was one thing, but the violin performance at the end was simply fantastic. It had the entire student body of Phillips Academy in an uproar.

"Um, Yooha?"

It wasn't just the students. Even the female science teacher came looking for Son Yooha during break. Most of them wanted to inquire about Kang Hyun's concert schedule.

Yooha felt like posting a notice on the school bulletin board saying, "No Kang Hyun concert in New York."

"Oppa."

As soon as school ended, Yooha headed straight to Kang Hyun's studio. She wanted to vent about what happened today and confront Kang Hyun, who caused all this.

Who gave him the right to show off like that in front of the entire student body? Although it all started because of her request, the heart of the seventeen-year-old girl was already angry.

"Oppa?"

But when she saw Kang Hyun lying with his head on the table, using it as a pillow, her anger melted away like a lie. He must have been writing music all day.

Carefully, Yooha tidied up around Kang Hyun's head and pouted her lips as she had done before.

Smooch.

At that moment,

"What are you doing?"

Kang Hyun opened his eyes and looked at Yooha.

"Oh no!"

Yooha inadvertently screamed and almost fell backward. Kang Hyun quickly got up and caught her by the waist. Yooha's cheeks turned red as if she had been caught stealing.

* * *

"Oh my Godâ€•!"

Hollywood's renowned director Jim Filmer gasped. He hurriedly went to his agency.

The reason was simple. Kang Hyun had sent him the work as soon as he finished the first phase.

Hadn't he asked Kang Hyun over the phone why his work was chosen?

'The script inspired the music.'

It was a musician's response. As soon as he arrived at the agency, Jim Filmer went straight to his office, not even acknowledging the greetings from his employees.

The thought of listening to Kang Hyun's work made his heart tremble.

"Whew."

Jim Filmer carefully inserted the tape sent by Kang Hyun into the player. After a moment of silence, the melody began to fill the office through the speakers.

The theme of the film, written and directed by Jim Filmer, was a thriller. It was undoubtedly a masterpiece script of his lifetime.

Thump thump thump.

The insert song composed by Kang Hyun made his hands clammy from the start. The eerie tones crashing against his ears were like waves breaking against a cliff.

It was as if the sinister melody portrayed a lurking killer in the darkness. It made his hair stand on end, his lips dry, and his throat parched.

Jim Filmer held his breath as he listened to Kang Hyun's music. There was no time to be amazed. Just listening to the insert song made the script visualize in his mind.

Swish.

The piercing sound was like a knife blade, making Jim Filmer's Adam's apple bob. As the melody reached its climax, his heart pounded as if it would burst.

The intense sound felt like it was hitting all the nerve endings in his body. The suspenseful tension, like the footsteps of a demon king, made it hard to breathe.

Jim Filmer felt a chill down his spine as if the demon king's long nails were scratching his back.

As the demon king reluctantly withdrew his hand, he could finally exhale the breath he had been holding.

Even after the melody ended and silence returned, the lingering feeling couldn't be shaken off.

His back was still drenched in cold sweat, like a downpour.

"Is this really just the first phase?"

Jim Filmer's voice was filled with disbelief. Kang Hyun had said that there were many parts to be revised in this first phase.

Moreover, it wasn't just one piece. There were still more insert songs he hadn't listened to yet.

Jim Filmer's eyes reflected a mixture of tension and excitement, flowing like a river.
