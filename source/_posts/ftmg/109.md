“Yooha, aren’t you sleeping?”

A tiny hand was busy packing.

“Mother, this girl is currently busy.”

Even preparing a pink suitcase was no ordinary task.

Was she returning to America? If so, she would have looked sad. But Son Yooha's face was as excited as a child the day before a picnic.

Even if exaggerated, the full moon in the night sky wouldn’t shine as brightly as her face right now.

“Anyone would think you’re going on an overseas trip. It’s just a day trip; do you really need that much luggage? If Yooha drags such a large suitcase, Hyun might be uncomfortable.”

At that moment, Son Yooha suddenly raised her head. Then, she pursed her lips, showing clear signs of concern on her face.

Im Hyera was beyond dumbfounded. The child, who insisted there was much to pack, suddenly changed her mind at the mention that Kang Hyun might be uncomfortable.

“I’ll pack your luggage, so why don’t we enjoy some mother-daughter tea time?”

“Mother, I’ll bring the tea. I feel sorry to wake up the housekeeper.”

“Oh my, Yooha has grown up, hasn’t she? But I’ve already brought it.”

Son Yooha had grown significantly, both in appearance and internally.

In fact, she was a very bright child who never troubled her parents since she was young. On the contrary, it was regrettable that she lacked the usual cuteness seen at that age.

In that sense, Im Hyera was only grateful to Kang Hyun these days. The once aloof and cold child had developed such warm eyes.

It was then.

“Mother, what did you like about Father?”

Son Yooha looked at her mother with curious eyes. Indeed, it was worth wondering. Im Hyera and Son Ilsung seemed like an unlikely pair at first glance.

Im Hyera was as strong-willed as any man. Didn’t Chairman Wang once joke truthfully that if Im Hyera had been his child, he would have chosen her as his successor without hesitation?

“At first, I didn’t like him. You know your father isn’t from Gyeongsang Province, but he’s incredibly blunt. However, he took care of me immensely in subtle ways. I fell for that. And crucially, your grandfather is very gentlemanly, isn’t he? When getting married, you must look at the elders of the family. Somehow, I ended up saying things I shouldn’t in front of a child.”

“Then I’m already approved. Hyun oppa’s grandfather and uncle and aunt are very nice to me.”

“Hmm?”

Son Yooha showed a happy expression as she held a teacup. Im Hyera let out a hollow laugh as she looked at her daughter.

Seeing her so happy, she had nothing to say. Ultimately, whether it remains a simple first love or becomes a long-standing relationship is up to the two of them.

“But Yooha, why did you ask Hyun to go on a trip to Busan with you?”

Of all places, why Busan? It was hard to understand. Son Yooha disliked water due to a childhood trauma from falling into a swimming pool.

But Son Yooha just winked like a fairy with a secret and didn’t answer.

* * *

“Oppa, here—!”

The eggshell was peeled, revealing its white flesh. For train trips, nothing beats eggs and soda.

The face of Son Yooha, who handed me the peeled egg, was full of excitement. Her usually cold and aloof eyes were constantly curved like crescent moons.

The Saemaeul train heading to Busan was filled with people of all kinds.

From university students going on an MT to Busan instead of Gapyeong, to merchants who had been sourcing goods from Dongdaemun since dawn.

Oh, and there were others. Those who glanced at us while hiding their faces behind newspapers.

Who are they? Of course, they were the bodyguards following Son Yooha. Naturally, the heir of a conglomerate wouldn’t travel to Busan alone.

“Oppa, I want to eat this!”

Wasn’t she like a fish in the water? She was already eating her third water rice cake from a street vendor in front of Busan Station. Worried she might get an upset stomach, I poured fish cake broth into a white paper cup for her.

“Oppa, can we go to Nampo-dong?”

“Sure, let’s go. You’re going back to America next week anyway, so you should enjoy your last weekend.”

Instead of Starbucks, coffee shops lined the streets, and thrift shops were everywhere.

The city’s finances seemed poor; the pavement blocks were so uneven that it was hard to tell if they were paved or unpaved. Well, it was the '90s after all.

Only the bodyguards had a hard time. They followed us from a distance, their eyes wide open to make sure they didn’t lose us.

“Let’s buy this, oppa.”

It was a stall selling cheap accessories. It looked so shabby that no one was even browsing, but Son Yooha’s eyes were already fixed on a silver ring.

It looked like a ring made by drilling a hole in a coin. Before I knew it, Son Yooha had finished the payment and was forcing the ring onto my finger.

It fit as if my finger size had been measured beforehand.

“It fits perfectly—!”

Well, we came all the way to Busan for a day trip; I should at least do this.

“Hey there, are you students from Seoul? Why are your faces so white and pretty? I’ll fill this plate with fresh fish for you, so have some sashimi here. If you have a plate of sashimi here, it’s like you’ve seen all of Beombawu—!”

It was when we had passed Haeundae and reached Gwangalli.

The fish market ladies’ solicitations near the night sea continued regardless of the travelers' age. Surely, this scene would remain unchanged even after twenty years.

I wanted to have a plate of sashimi and a glass of soju, but Son Yooha was still sticking close to me with her bright eyes.

“Oppa, can we go to Chungmu?”

“Chungmu?”

“Yes. The magazine said it’s the Naples of the East?”

She meant Tongyeong, which had merged with Chungmu City a few years ago.

It wasn’t the longest day of June, but the sun was still hot. With plenty of time until sunset, we headed to the passenger terminal together.

“Oppa, let’s take a photo!”

As soon as we arrived at the harbor, I took a picture with the red lighthouse in the background. The sound of the shutter was perfect; indeed, disposable cameras are the best for trips.

As the sound of seagulls stimulated my creative mind,

Growl.

Son Yooha held her stomach and smiled shyly, embarrassed. Moments like these made me doubt if this was the ice queen I knew.

We soothed our hunger with Chungmu gimbap and udon as we explored various places in Tongyeong until evening arrived.

It was time to return to Seoul. However,

“Yooha, the last boat is about to leave. Let’s hurry.”

Son Yooha kept stalling. She claimed to have left the camera behind, then said her shoelaces were untied, intentionally delaying.

Finally, just before the dock, she claimed her stomach hurt and rushed into the terminal restroom.

How much time had passed? She came out cautiously with the sound of the boat’s horn fading away.

“Sorry, oppa.”

I almost burst into laughter. Her voice was as small as an ant, but her face had a shy smile.

What a sly fox. But the bodyguards following us would arrange for another boat, so there was no need to worry.

But,

Huh?

The bodyguards who had been following us were nowhere to be seen.

“What did Chief Kim say?”

A deep curiosity was etched around the wrinkled eyes.

“He said it was like seeing a ghost. He mentioned that he had dealt with many talented individuals in the Strategic Planning Office, but he had never seen anyone so boldly exploit gaps like that. It was to the extent that he felt like his mind was being read, making him feel chilled to the bone.”

“Ha.”

Chairman Wang let out an exclamation mixed with admiration.

Who was Chief Kim? He was the head of the Strategic Planning Office and a student nurtured personally by Chairman Wang himself.

He was an exceptional talent, to the extent that he was called a prodigy. How else would he have been entrusted with the Strategic Planning Office, the brain of Jeil Group?

“And did he say anything else?”

“There is something, but…”

Son Ilsung’s face briefly showed hesitation. It was an opinion given by Chief Kim, but it was slightly exaggerated.

Under Chairman Wang’s continued urging, Son Ilsung had no choice but to speak up.

“He said it was the second time.”

“What was?”

“That he felt like his mind was being read. The first time was when he met you in person. Of course, it wasn’t as chilling and spine-tingling as with you, but he exaggerated to say it was similar.”

Chairman Wang licked his dry lips with regret.

He had been intrigued ever since Kang Hyun mentioned that the Strategic Planning Office was the first place he wanted to go. To think he would engage in such a heated debate with the head of the Strategic Planning Office.

It takes considerable boldness to hold one’s ground among such formidable executives. Even seasoned executives often said they felt suffocated listening to Chief Kim’s presentations.

And yet, Kang Hyun acted like a fish in water among them; it was deeply regrettable not to have witnessed it with his own eyes.

‘Well, even at Dongju, they said he was like that.’

Hadn’t Chairman Yoo mentioned it before? About Kang Hyun’s unwavering stance against executives opposing new material development.

What seemed like an exaggeration turned out to be nothing compared to what had happened at the Strategic Planning Office.

* * *

“Hyun, what would you like for dinner?”

Director Im Hyera carefully opened the studio door and spoke, but there was no response.

Kang Hyun was just staring intently at the score, relentlessly drawing notes on the staff.

It was a concentration so intense that even a natural disaster wouldn’t make him blink.

In the end, Director Im Hyera shook her head and closed the door. He had been like this ever since his solo recital was just around the corner.

How much time had passed?

“Are you still working?”

Just then, Baek Junghoon entered the studio, his mouth wide open, wearing the same expression as Director Im Hyera.

The unfinished scores scattered on the floor looked like a scene from Amadeus.

It had been several hours already. If you put a traditional Korean wig on that boy sitting on the chair, he would be perfect to be called the Mozart of the East.

“Phew, it’s done—!”

At that moment, Kang Hyun stretched his arms toward the ceiling and shouted.

“Oh, hyung, when did you come in?”

“If someone saw, they’d think a tiger could carry you away, and you wouldn’t notice. From what I see, the score is already perfect. Why do you keep revising it? Even the pre-revised score would make people drop their jaws. They say geniuses are perfectionists, and you, Hyun, certainly prove it.”

“I want to give my best, as people are coming to listen to my music.”

Baek Junghoon smiled as if he had expected that answer. With such innate talent, and he was working so hard.

“By the way, Hyun, did you stay out last weekend?”

“What?”

“Director Im Hyera said you went to Busan and stayed overnight. They say a quiet cat climbs the stove first.”

Baek Junghoon squinted his eyes and looked at Kang Hyun.

“The boat schedule got canceled, so I had no choice.”

“Boat? No way—!”

“Hyung, I’m still a high school student. What are you imagining?”

Kang Hyun smiled as if he couldn’t believe it.

Although Baek Junghoon was called the Terius of pianists, he was just as clueless about dating as Kang Hyun. No wonder there were rumors that Baek Junghoon liked men.

“Anyway, let’s practice together, shall we?”

“Alright, I came here intending to practice all night.”

Baek Junghoon grinned and walked towards the piano stool.

Had playing the piano ever been this enjoyable? When playing with Kang Hyun, adrenaline surged through his body.

Surely, past exceptional geniuses who had collaborated with other musicians must have felt the same way.

It was natural to feel the joy of a musician rather than jealousy and envy.

“By the way, Hyun, did anything happen while you stayed in Busan?”

“I told you, nothing happened.”

“Look at this, you’re dating, aren’t you?”

It was when Kang Hyun tried to change the subject by picking up his violin case. Baek Junghoon, with eyes as wide as saucers, rushed towards Kang Hyun.

Baek Junghoon suddenly grabbed Kang Hyun’s hand and exclaimed with admiration.

“You’re already wearing a ring—!”
