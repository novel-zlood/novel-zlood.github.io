"Yooha, are you still awake?"

A small hand is busy packing.

"Mother, I am currently busy."

Even the pink suitcase she prepared was no ordinary sight.

Going back to America? If that were the case, her face would look sad. But right now, Son Yooha's face was excited, like a child the day before a picnic.

Exaggerating a bit, even the full moon in the night sky wouldn’t shine as brightly as her face now.

"Anyone would think you were going on an overseas trip. Do you really need that much luggage for a day trip? If you drag around such a big suitcase, Hyun might find it inconvenient."

At that moment, Son Yooha quickly lifted her head. Then she pressed her lips together, clearly showing signs of deep thought.

Im Hyera was beyond baffled. The child who had insisted on packing so much suddenly changed her stance just because Hyun might find it inconvenient.

"I'll pack the luggage for you. How about we enjoy some tea time together, mother and daughter?"

"Mother, I'll bring the tea. I don't want to wake up the housekeeper."

"My, my, our Yooha has grown up so much. I already brought it."

Son Yooha had grown considerably, both in appearance and inner maturity.

In fact, since she was young, she had never caused her parents much worry. She was a very bright child, though it was a bit disappointing that she lacked the usual cuteness seen at that age.

In that sense, Im Hyera was grateful to Hyun these days. The once cold and aloof child now had warm eyes.

It was then.

"Mother, what did you like about father?"

Son Yooha looked at her mother with curious eyes. It was understandable. Im Hyera and Son Ilseon seemed like an unlikely pair at first glance.

Im Hyera was a woman with a strong personality, even stronger than most men. No wonder Chairman Wang joked that if she were his child, he would have chosen her as his successor without hesitation.

"At first, I didn't like him. You know, your father is not from Gyeongsang-do, but he is extremely blunt. But without me realizing, he was always taking care of me. I fell for that. And most importantly, wasn't your grandfather very gentle? When you get married, you must also consider the elders in the family. I can't believe I'm saying all this in front of a child."

"Then I am already accepted. Hyun oppa's grandfather and aunt and uncle are very kind to me."

"Huh?"

Son Yooha smiled happily and lifted her teacup. Im Hyera let out a laugh and looked at her daughter.

Seeing her so happy, there was nothing more to say. Whether it ended as a simple first love or turned into a long-lasting relationship was up to them.

"But Yooha, why did you ask Hyun to travel to Busan together?"

Of all places, why Busan? Son Yooha hated water due to a trauma from falling into a swimming pool when she was young.

However, Son Yooha just winked like a fairy with a secret and didn’t answer.

* * *

"Oppa, here—!"

The eggshell was peeled, revealing the white inside. Egg and soda were the best for train trips.

Son Yooha's face was full of excitement as she handed me the peeled egg. Her eyes, which always seemed cold and aloof, were now curved like crescent moons.

On the Saemaeul-ho heading to Busan, there were all sorts of people.

From college students going on an MT to Busan instead of Gapyeong to merchants bringing goods from Dongdaemun early in the morning.

Oh, and there were also people peeking at us from behind their newspapers.

Who were they? Of course, they were the bodyguards following Son Yooha. No way would a chaebol's child travel to Busan alone.

"Oppa, I want to eat this!"

She was like a fish in water. She was already on her third water tteok from a stall in front of Busan Station. Worried she might get indigestion, I poured some fish cake broth into a white paper cup for her.

"Oppa, can we go to Nampo-dong?"

"Sure, let's go. You’ll be going back to America next week, so you should enjoy your last weekend to the fullest."

Instead of Starbucks, there were coffee shops, and the streets were lined with second-hand clothing stores.

The city's budget seemed tight, as the sidewalk blocks were so uneven that it was hard to tell if they were paved or not. After all, it was the 90s.

The bodyguards were having a hard time, following us from a distance with their eyes peeled so as not to lose us.

"Let's buy this, oppa."

It was a stall selling shabby accessories. It looked so shabby that no one was even browsing, but Son Yooha’s eyes were already fixed on a silver ring.

It looked like a ring made from a coin with a hole drilled in it. Before I knew it, Son Yooha had finished paying and was forcing the ring onto my finger.

It fit as if it had been measured for my finger.

"It fits perfectly—!"

Well, since we came all the way to Busan for a day trip, this much should be fine.

"Wow, are you students from Seoul? Your skin is so fair and pretty. I'll fill this plate with fresh seafood for you. If you eat a plate of sashimi here, it's like you’ve seen all of Beombawi—!"

It was around the time we arrived at Gwangalli after passing Haeundae.

The fish market ladies' touting at the night sea doesn't discriminate against travelers by their age. This sight probably hasn’t changed even after twenty years.

I wanted to have a plate of sashimi and a glass of soju, but Son Yooha was still clinging to my side with bright eyes.

"Oppa, can we go to Chungmu?"

"Chungmu?"

"Yes. The magazine said it’s the Naples of the East."

She was referring to Tongyeong, which had merged with Chungmu a few years ago.

It wasn't mid-June, the longest day of the year, but the sun was still hot. Since it was still a long time until sunset, we headed to the ferry terminal together.

"Oppa, let's take a photo!"

As soon as we arrived at the harbor, I took a photo of her with the red lighthouse in the background. The click of the camera was perfect; indeed, disposable cameras were the best for trips.

When the cries of seagulls sparked a musical idea in my mind.

Growl.

Son Yooha, embarrassed, held her stomach and smiled shyly. At times like this, I wondered if she was really the ice queen I knew.

We soothed our hunger with Chungmu gimbap and udon and roamed around Tongyeong until evening came.

It was time to head back to Seoul. But.

"Yooha, they say this is the last ferry. We need to hurry."

For some reason, Son Yooha kept dawdling. She said she left the camera behind and then pretended her shoelaces were untied, stalling for time.

Finally, just before reaching the pier, she ran into the restroom of the passenger terminal, claiming her stomach hurt.

How much time had passed? With the sound of the ferry leaving in the distance, Son Yooha cautiously walked out.

"Sorry, oppa."

I almost burst out laughing. Despite the tiny voice like an ant, her face was blushing with a shy smile.

What a sly fox. But the bodyguards following us would figure out a way to get us on another ferry, so there was no need to worry.

But,

Huh?

The bodyguards who had been following us so diligently were nowhere to be seen.

"What did Chief Kim say?"

Deep curiosity showed in the wrinkled eyes.

"He said it felt like seeing a ghost. He had dealt with many talented people in the strategy planning department, but he had never seen anyone so boldly exploit gaps. It felt like the person knew in advance how he would respond, making him almost feel like his mind was being read."

"Whoa."

Chairman Wang let out an admiring exclamation.

Who was Chief Kim? He was the head of the strategy planning department and a scholar of Jeil Group, personally nurtured by Chairman Wang.

He was an outstanding talent, to the extent that he was called a genius among geniuses. Otherwise, would he have been entrusted with the brain of Jeil Group, the strategy planning department?

"And did he say anything else?"

"Actually, there is more."

A moment of hesitation passed over Son Ilseon's face. It was Chief Kim's impression, but it was somewhat exaggerated.

Under the chairman's continued urging, Son Ilseon had no choice but to speak.

"He said it was the second time."

"The second time for what?"

"The second time he felt like his mind was being read. The first time was when he met you, Chairman. Although it wasn’t as chilling as when he met you, he said it felt somewhat exaggerated."

Chairman Wang licked his dry lips with a hint of regret.

Since Kang Hyun had first mentioned the strategy planning department as the place he wanted to go, his interest had been piqued. And now, to have argued so fiercely with the head of the strategy planning department.

Without considerable boldness, it would be difficult to assert oneself among such formidable executives. Even seasoned executives often felt suffocated listening to Chief Kim's presentations.

And yet, he had acted like a fish in water among them. It was a pity not to have witnessed the scene with his own eyes.

'Yes, Chairman Yoo mentioned it before.'

Didn't Chairman Yoo tell him about it before? How Kang Hyun had boldly hit the mark against executives who opposed new material development.

What he thought was an exaggeration turned out to be an understatement compared to what happened in the strategy planning department.

* * *

"Hyun, what do you want for dinner?"

Chairman Im Hyera cautiously opened the door to the studio and spoke, but no answer came.

Kang Hyun was just staring intently at the score, continuously jotting down notes on the staff.

His concentration was so intense that even a natural disaster wouldn’t make him blink.

In the end, Chairman Im Hyera shook her head and closed the door. He had been like this for the past few days, with the solo concert just around the corner.

How much time had passed?

"Are you still working?"

Just then, Baek Jung-hoon opened the studio door and came in. He wore the same expression as Chairman Im Hyera, with his mouth agape.

The incomplete sheets of music scattered on the floor looked like a scene from Amadeus.

Already, it had been several hours of intense concentration. If you put a wig on that boy sitting in the chair, he could be called the Mozart of the East.

"Whew, finished—!"

At that moment, Kang Hyun stretched his arms toward the ceiling and shouted.

"Oh, hyung, when did you come in?"

"Anyone would think a tiger could carry you away without you noticing. Why do you keep revising? Even the unrevised score would astonish people. They say geniuses are perfectionists, and seeing you, Hyun, I guess it's not wrong."

"I want to give my best since people are coming to listen to my music."

Baek Jung-hoon smiled as if he had expected this. A person with innate talent was working so fiercely.

"By the way, Hyun, did you sleep out last weekend?"

"What?"

"Chairman Im Hyera said you went to Busan and stayed the night. They say a quiet cat climbs the stove first."

Baek Jung-hoon squinted his eyes and looked at Kang Hyun.

"The ferry was the last one, so I had no choice."

"A ferry? No way—!"

"Hyung, I'm still a high school student. What are you imagining?"

Kang Hyun smiled as if he couldn’t believe it.

Baek Jung-hoon, known as the Terius of pianists, was as clueless about dating as Kang Hyun. No wonder there were even rumors that Baek Jung-hoon liked men.

"Stop talking and let’s practice together, okay?"

"Alright, I came here determined to practice all night."

Baek Jung-hoon chuckled and headed to the piano bench.

When was the last time playing the piano was this enjoyable? When playing in harmony with Kang Hyun, adrenaline surged through his body.

Surely, those who collaborated with the geniuses of the past felt the same way.

It was only natural to feel the joy of being a musician rather than jealousy and envy.

"By the way, Hyun, nothing happened while you were staying in Busan?"

"I told you, nothing happened."

"Come on, you’re dating, right?"

As Kang Hyun tried to change the subject and picked up his violin case, Baek Jung-hoon suddenly dashed towards him with wide eyes.

Baek Jung-hoon unexpectedly grabbed Kang Hyun’s hand and exclaimed in awe.

"You’re already wearing a ring—!"

The silver ring on Kang Hyun’s finger was gleaming brilliantly, catching Baek Jung-hoon's eye.
