"Director Choi, how did the Dubai matter go?"

It was a meeting of executives from Jeil Trading Company. The faces of the elderly executives were filled with tension.

Jeil Trading executives referred to the weekly meeting as “the resurrection of Chairman Wang” due to the pressure they felt.

"The Dubai side is requesting a more grand and curvaceous tower design to emphasize the architectural beauty of Delia Purpu. Based on the opinions of our on-site staff dispatched to Dubai, we estimate that the construction period will be extended by at least three to five years if we go with the tower design."

"Director Choi, do you think the tower design is appropriate?"

"Since this is a request from the Dubai side, it's hard to reject it outright."

"It's a building more than twice the height of the Taipei Financial Center. In super-tall building construction, safety comes first. Second, preserving architectural beauty is the job of experts, not something the general public can do. Considering the height of Delia Purpu, design it in the shape of a pen tip to withstand strong winds and soft ground. If they don't like that design, tell the Dubai side to design the tower themselves."

The woman sitting at the head of the table continued.

"Think about why the Dubai side is making such unreasonable proposals. Ultimately, it's a matter of who holds the upper hand. If we hastily start construction, intoxicated by oil money, we could make a mistake. Even if an accident happens and we try to evade responsibility, Jeil Trading would end up taking the blame. The chairman has always reminded us not to focus only on visible assets."

The executives in the meeting room looked as tense as students standing before a principal.

The woman at the head of the table scanned the room and finally looked at Director Choi, speaking firmly.

"Furthermore, Jeil Trading currently has the world's best lifting equipment technology and super-tall pumping technology. They know we are the most knowledgeable about safety, so they won't be able to say much. I believe Director Choi can persuade them to that extent."

Even after the seemingly endless meeting ended, the executives' faces remained tense. The reason was none other than the woman sitting at the head of the table.

She was not only young and in the position of president of Jeil Trading, but also so capable that even the seasoned executives had to admit her abilities.

Some senior executives even said her business acumen and management skills resembled those of the late Chairman Wang.

She is none other than the queen of Jeil Trading, Son Yooha.

"Secretary Kim, clear all my evening schedules today."

Various nicknames were used to refer to President Son Yooha within the company. But the most famous one was "the queen of Jeil Trading."

Her appearance rivaled that of any movie star's. In fact, she was even more outstanding than actresses and exuded natural elegance. Time magazine even selected her as the world's most beautiful female CEO. And what about her management skills?

It was said that Jeil Trading, which had been making strides, regained its vitality with the queen's breath.

Her charisma was so remarkable that it reminded people of the late Chairman Wang. Her eloquence captivated those around her, and the overwhelming feeling from her deep eyes suggested that if she weren't in the business world, she would have made significant strides in politics.

President Son Yooha wanted to go home as soon as possible. But looking at the approval documents in front of her, she knew leaving on time today was impossible.

As president, can't she do as she pleases? No, she was fully aware of how many people's lives depended on her every word.

"I want to see him soon."

President Son Yooha looked at the photo frames on the table. The charisma that had overwhelmed the elderly executives was gone, and her eyes shone like those of a teenage girl.

The photo frames on the table were varied, but the one that stood out the most was a photo with a single man.

She looked at one of the photos. In it, a young man and woman were hugging and kissing below a concert hall.

* * *

"Your Majesty."

The Bozar Hall was filled with the audience. The King of Belgium was also in attendance for the national event, along with television cameras and numerous reporters.

"Ladies and gentlemen."

The host tried to calm his overwhelming emotions as he spoke. The audience included many renowned figures.

Among them were not only musicians but also globally famous dignitaries, highlighting the high prestige of the Queen Elisabeth Competition.

Anna felt her heart pounding. It had been the same seven years ago. She had been overwhelmed by the pressure of the Bozar Hall, her face turning pale, but Kang Hyun had comforted and calmed her.

She still couldn't forget his warm touch.

"Anna."

At that moment, Sabrina, sitting opposite her, grabbed Anna's hand.

Although Sabrina was known to have no competition experience, she was the most composed among the participants.

Her touch was as warm as Kang Hyun's seven years ago, finally calming Anna, who then glanced around.

Except for Sabrina, the other participants in the waiting room all looked tense.

Sabrina suddenly stood up and spoke to the young violinists.

"Relax your tense heart and focus only on the violin till the end."

It was the advice Kang Hyun had given her seven years ago. Hadn't they all looked toward the dawn of melodies while sharing joys and sorrows at Chappelle?

Anna, with a trembling voice, said so, and everyone finally showed faint smiles and nodded vigorously.

Anna exchanged glances with Sabrina and added forcefully,

"Everyone, let's show the best performance for the audience."

* * *

"The last performer is Anna from Russia."

The audience's attention focused on the host's voice. Kang Hyun, sitting at the judge's table, was no exception.

Maestro Eden Simeon's face was full of anticipation. He was curious about what kind of performance she would deliver.

Today's stage would determine the winner of the Queen Elisabeth Competition. But Anna's face looked far more relaxed than seven years ago.

Wearing a dress reminiscent of the Moscow sky, she stepped onto the stage, and the buzzing audience fell silent in an instant.

As the violinist took her position, the wind of Moscow seemed to blow. At that moment, the symphony began with Eden Simeon's vigorous conducting.

At the first note, the judges leaned forward. A mighty wind blew alongside the rising prelude of the Belgian National Symphony Orchestra.

It was a wind stronger than the northern wind of Moscow. Though it could have been overwhelming, Anna was unfazed.

Zing―!

With a clear high note, the violinist's bowing began.

The judges couldn't hide their admiration. It felt like witnessing a caterpillar emerging from its cocoon and becoming a butterfly.

The beautiful and grand trembling of the melody made the curtains of Bozar Hall flutter.

The audience's heavy breathing echoed in their ears. It was a sign that the chills had penetrated their entire bodies.

* * *

Although the concerto and free piece had ended, Anna was still in a daze.

She had undoubtedly put her all into the performance, but rather than feeling exhausted, she felt refreshed. The other participants also seemed to feel the same, as their expressions looked relieved.

At that moment, Sabrina approached Anna and asked,

"Anna, what exactly happened?"

What did she mean?

"The color of your melody was entirely different from a few days ago. It felt as if the violin was rejoicing."

Ah, Anna realized it then. She had changed.

Precisely, it was after she had seen Kang Hyun and the pure white deer meeting in the forest of Chappelle a few days ago.

Hadn't the inspiration from that moment turned into a melody and wrapped around her mind?

"Confess after the results come out today."

"Huh?"

"Anna, did you think I didn't know you like Hyun? It was so obvious. If you don't do it today, you won't have another chance. Even if you don't succeed, it's better than holding it in."

With that advice, Sabrina returned to her original seat as if nothing had happened.

How much time had passed? After the award ceremony ended, cheers and applause were heard on the stage.

But Anna's gaze remained fixed on Kang Hyun, who was sitting at the judges' table.

'Do I really like him?'

She wondered. Did her heart race because she truly loved Kang Hyun? Or was she captivated by his mysterious charm, which marked her heart during her adolescent years?

It was after the competition had ended.

A woman approached Kang Hyun. Anna recognized her immediately.

She was the girl who had given Kang Hyun loving glances during the Queen Elisabeth Competition seven years ago.

Now a grown woman, she had come to see Kang Hyun again. He looked surprised by her sudden visit, but the joy seemed greater.

"Anna?"

At that moment, Sabrina looked at Anna with concern. She hadn't expected Yooha to appear here.

But to her surprise, Anna was smiling refreshingly.

"I'm fine. After all, I won this award."

Anna beamed and held up the winner's trophy. Surely, her mentor Alexei in Russia would also be unable to hide his joy upon seeing this trophy.

"Mentor?"

At that moment, Anna saw a familiar figure walking from the audience. It was Alexei, the dean of the Moscow Conservatory and her mentor.

He patted her head and handed her a bouquet. Though his face remained expressionless, he wore a faint smile when facing Anna.

Anna knew that even stoic Alexei was the most jubilant at that moment. Alexei also knew that Anna had feelings for Kang Hyun.

"Aren't you disappointed?"

"How could I be? I won this award today, didn't I? Now you'll be busy boasting that your student won the Queen Elisabeth Competition, right?"

"You've done well."

Listening to Alexei's praise, Anna glanced at Kang Hyun, who was sitting at the judges' table.

He was smiling at her. Kang Hyun, who had hugged and congratulated her during the award presentation, hadn't held back his words of praise.

Anna's mind was flooded with memories of the days she spent with Kang Hyun. He was the one who had changed her musical values and inspired her infinitely as a violinist.

A mysterious muse.

Anna finally understood.

Although she liked and missed Kang Hyun, it wasn't love. Rather, it was a sense of admiration that was stronger.
