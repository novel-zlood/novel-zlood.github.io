"Director Choi, what's the status on the Dubai proposal?"

It was a meeting of the executives of Jeil Trading. The faces of the elderly executives were filled with tension without exception.

The executives of Jeil Trading felt so much pressure that they referred to the weekly meeting as the "resurrection of Chairman Wang."

"The Dubai side is requesting a more grandiose and curved tower design to highlight the architectural beauty of Delia Purpur. Based on the opinions of our on-site personnel dispatched to Dubai, we estimate that if we proceed with the tower design, the construction period will increase by at least three to five years."

"Director Choi, do you really think the tower design is the right choice?"

"Since it's a request from the Dubai side, it's hard to refuse easily."

"The building is more than twice as tall as the Taipei Financial Center. The construction of a super-high-rise building prioritizes safety above all else. Secondly, preserving architectural beauty is the job of experts, not laypeople. Consider designing it in a pen nib shape to withstand strong winds and weak ground, considering the height of Delia Purpur. If they don't like that design, tell them to design the tower themselves."

The woman at the head of the table added further.

"Think about why the Dubai side made such an unreasonable proposal. Ultimately, it's a matter of who holds the upper hand. If we start construction hastily, drunk on oil money, we might make a grave mistake. If an accident happens, Jeil Trading will end up taking the blame. The Chairman always said not to focus only on visible wealth."

The executives in the conference room looked as tense as students standing in front of a strict teacher.

The woman at the head of the table scanned the room and finally looked at Director Choi, speaking firmly.

"Furthermore, our lifting equipment technology and super-high-rise pumping technology are currently the best in the world. They know that we have the best understanding of safety, so they won't be able to say much. I trust that you can persuade them, Director Choi."

The seemingly endless meeting finally ended, but the faces of the executives were still filled with tension. The reason was none other than the woman at the head of the table.

Not only did she become the president of Jeil Trading at a young age, but her abilities were so outstanding that even the experienced executives raised their hands in surrender.

Some senior executives even said that her business drive and management skills were reminiscent of the late Chairman Wang.

She was none other than Son Yooha, the queen of Jeil Trading.

"Secretary Kim, clear my schedule for tonight."

There were many nicknames for President Son Yooha within the company, but the most famous was the Queen of Jeil Trading.

Her appearance was comparable to that of a movie star, no, even more outstanding than most actresses, and she had an innate elegance that even Time magazine selected her as the world's most beautiful female CEO. Moreover, her management skills were impeccable.

There was even a saying that Jeil Trading, which had been struggling, regained its vitality with the queen's breath.

Her charisma was so impressive that it reminded people of the late Chairman Wang. Her eloquence captivated those around her, and the overwhelming presence in her deep gaze was such that she would have excelled in politics if not in business.

President Son Yooha wanted to leave work as soon as possible. However, looking at the approval documents in front of her, it seemed impossible to leave on time today as well.

Can she do whatever she wants just because she's the president? No way, she knows how many people's lives are affected by her every word.

"I want to see him soon."

President Son Yooha looked at the frames on the table. The charisma she had shown while overwhelming the elderly executives was nowhere to be found, and her eyes were shining like those of a teenage girl.

Among the nameplate and the various frames on the table, the one that stood out the most was a photo of her with a single man.

She looked at one of the photos. It was of a young man and woman embracing and kissing each other under a concert hall.

"Dear Majesty."

Bozar Hall was filled with an audience. As befitting a national event, the King of Belgium was also in attendance, and the hall was packed with TV cameras and various reporters.

"And ladies and gentlemen."

The host calmed his rising emotions and recited his lines. The audience included numerous famous figures.

Not only musicians but also globally renowned big names were present, highlighting the immense prestige of the Queen Elisabeth Competition.

Anna felt her heart pounding. It was the same seven years ago. She was overwhelmed by the pressure of Bozar Hall, and Kang Hyun comforted and calmed her.

She still hadn't forgotten his warm touch.

"Anna."

At that moment, Sabrina, who was sitting across from her, held Anna's hand.

She was known to have no competition experience, yet she was the most composed among the participants.

Her touch was as warm as Kang Hyun's had been seven years ago, and Anna finally calmed down and looked around.

Except for Sabrina, the participants in the waiting room all had tense expressions.

Sabrina suddenly stood up and spoke to the novice violinists.

"Relax and focus on your violin until the end."

It was the advice Kang Hyun had given her seven years ago. Hadn't they all endured the dawn of melody together at the Chapelle?

When Anna said this in a trembling voice, everyone smiled faintly and nodded vigorously.

Anna exchanged a glance with Sabrina and added confidently,

"Everyone, let's give the best performance for the audience."

* * *

"The last performer is Anna, a violinist from Russia."

At the host's voice, the audience's attention focused. Kang Hyun, sitting at the judges' table, was no exception.

Maestro Eden Simeon had a look of expectation on his face. He was curious about what kind of performance she would present.

Today's stage would determine the winner of the Queen Elisabeth Competition. However, Anna's face looked much more relaxed than it had seven years ago.

As she walked onto the stage in a dress reminiscent of Moscow's sky, the murmuring audience quickly fell silent.

As the violinist took her position, the wind of Moscow blew. At that moment, with Eden Simeon's vigorous conducting, the symphony began.

At the first note, the judges leaned forward. With the rising prelude of the Belgian National Orchestra, a grand wind blew.

It was a melody as fierce as the north wind of Moscow. While it could have been overwhelming, Anna was not.

Zingâ€•!

With a clear high note, the violinist's bowing began.

The judges couldn't hide their admiration. If one were to witness a caterpillar emerging from its cocoon and becoming a butterfly in front of their eyes, it would feel like this.

The beautiful and grand trembling of the melody made the curtains of Bozar Hall flutter.

The audience's intense breathing filled the ears. Such was the thrill that ran through their entire bodies.

* * *

After the ensemble and free piece ended, Anna was still in a daze.

She had poured her heart into the performance on stage, but instead of feeling exhausted, she felt refreshed. The other participants also looked relieved.

At that moment, Sabrina approached Anna and asked,

"Anna, what happened?"

What did she mean?

"The color of your melody changed completely from a few days ago. It was like the violin was rejoicing."

Ah, Anna realized it then. She had changed.

More precisely, it was after she saw Kang Hyun and the pure white deer in the forest of Chapelle a few days ago.

Hadn't the impression from that moment turned into a melody that swirled in her mind?

"Confess when the results come out today."

"What?"

"Anna, did you think I didn't know you like Hyun? It's so obvious. Today is your only chance. Even if you don't succeed, it's better than holding it in."

Sabrina finished her advice and returned to her seat as if nothing had happened.

How much time had passed? After the awards ceremony, she received cheers and applause on stage.

But Anna's gaze was still fixed on Kang Hyun, who was sitting at the judges' table.

'Do I really like him?'

She wondered. Was her heart pounding because of genuine love for Kang Hyun? Or was it because she was fascinated by his mysterious charm that marked her teenage years?

It was after the curtain had fallen on the competition.

She saw a woman approaching Kang Hyun. Anna recognized her well.

She was the girl who had given Kang Hyun a loving gaze at the Queen Elisabeth Competition seven years ago.

Now a proper lady, she had come to find Kang Hyun again. Kang Hyun seemed surprised by her sudden visit, but his delight was evident.

"Anna?"

At that moment, Sabrina looked at Anna with concern. She hadn't imagined Yooha would appear here.

But surprisingly, Anna wore a refreshing smile.

"I'm fine, I even got this award, didn't I?"

Anna smiled bashfully and held up the winner's trophy. Surely her mentor Alexei in Russia would be overjoyed to see this trophy.

"Mentor?"

At that moment, Anna saw a familiar figure walking from the audience. It was Alexei, the principal of the Moscow Conservatory and her mentor.

He patted her head and handed her a bouquet. His face remained expressionless, but he wore a faint smile when facing Anna.

Anna knew that the stoic Alexei was the happiest person there. Alexei also knew that Anna had feelings for Kang Hyun.

"Aren't you disappointed?"

"Not at all, I even got this award today, didn't I? Now you'll be busy boasting about your student winning the Queen Elisabeth Competition, won't you?"

"You've done well."

Hearing her mentor Alexei's praise, Anna glanced at Kang Hyun sitting at the judges' table.

He was smiling at her. He had already hugged her when awarding the winner and had not held back his congratulations.

Memories of her past days with Kang Hyun flashed through Anna's mind. He was the one who had transformed her musical values and had given her endless inspiration as a violinist.

A mysterious muse.

Anna finally understood.

She liked and missed Kang Hyun, but it wasn't love. Instead, it was more of admiration.

Thus, Anna's first love was passing by.
