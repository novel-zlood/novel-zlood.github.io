"다브노 네 비젤리시(It's been a long time)."

Like a decalcomania, the two people's appearances and atmospheres were similar.

Underneath their raised eyebrows, cold glints shone, and the chill flowing along their sharp noses resembled a portrait of the former Soviet Union.

If strangers saw them, they might believe it was a meeting of mafia bosses.

"You met Hyun?"

At the stiff question from Alexei, the director of the Moscow Conservatory, Maxim Ivanov nodded briefly.

A strange curiosity arose in Alexei's eyes. How would Maxim Ivanov, known for being endlessly picky and cold in music, evaluate the audacious youngster?

"I can't believe you, who rarely moves, flew all the way to Korea. It really feels like the world is changing. Maxim, what was Hyun like?"

"He was annoying."

"Annoying?"

Maxim answered without a moment's hesitation. Alexei showed a puzzled expression at the unexpected answer.

"I didn't expect the person my only student admires to be so perfect."

"It's quite strange to hear the word 'perfect' coming from you."

"I heard his music through the video and album of the royal performance. I wanted to see his conducting and performance in person. Hyun guided me to his studio without hesitation for a foreigner like me."

Maxim's cold eyes were reminiscing about the past. It was his first meeting with Kang Hyun.

Kang Hyun looked young, but his deep eyes and aura, which were hard to read, exceeded Maxim's expectations.

His fluent Russian and natural conversational skills eventually made the usually taciturn Maxim speak.

Moreover, how was his conducting and performance?

"I couldn't hide my admiration. It felt as if a grand orchestra was in his mind. Watching his bright conducting like the blazing sun, countless melodies and musical ideas flashed before my eyes like lightning. Especially, the sheet music piled up like a mountain, each one was a pearl in a shell, so what more can I say?"

Excitement was evident in Maxim's eyes. But his voice, mixed with numerous emotions like falling leaves, flowed out. It was likely because of his student, Baek Junghoon.

"Tchaikovsky admired the classical musician Mozart, and we grew up admiring such Tchaikovsky. If Rachmaninoff is the mountain that pianists have to overcome, then for violinists, it would be Niccolò Paganini. Admiring and envying such already dead musicians isn't a problem. We may feel envy and jealousy towards them, but we don't feel despair because they have already become legends."

Alexei nodded in agreement. It was a relatable story. Feeling inferior to those already dead didn't lead to despair and collapse.

Then Maxim, thinking of Baek Junghoon who had visited Korea, spoke.

"But the important thing is that Hyun is only a nineteen-year-old boy."

"The Seoul Arts Center?"

The reason for visiting the Seoul Arts Center with Baek Junghoon from the morning was simple.

Baek Junghoon seemed to be struggling with an extreme slump. Looking at his dark circles under his eyes from sleepless nights, he looked like a long-term student repeatedly failing the bar exam in Sillim-dong.

"I need to properly check your condition, hyung."

Baek Junghoon was working as a guest conductor in Russia.

A guest conductor literally means a guest. It's not easy to determine the harmony with the sensitive and emotional musicians of an orchestra with only a few meetings.

Especially, Russian orchestras were rumored to be as cliquish as those in Europe, and Baek Junghoon had endured in such places for years.

Such a lethargic appearance didn't suit him.

"Hyun!"

At that moment, the director of the Seoul Arts Center greeted me with a delighted face. He had become an ardent fan of mine for some time. Thanks to the director, it was easy to observe the rehearsal of the Seoul Symphony Orchestra.

The director looked at Baek Junghoon with a peculiar gaze, and the reason was simple. Baek Junghoon had distinct features and a tall stature. His gaunt cheeks and grown hair made him look like a model.

Anyone who remembered Baek Junghoon's past appearance might be confused.

When the principal oboist played a long 'A' note, the members promptly tuned their instruments. Baek Junghoon and I took our seats in the empty audience.

Soon, an elderly conductor stepped onto the stage.

How much time had passed? The rehearsal was excellent enough to live up to the reputation of Korea's top symphony orchestra. That was when it happened.

"Hyung, did something seem wrong?"

"What?"

"In the symphony that was just played."

Baek Junghoon showed an unexpected troubled expression. It was understandable since we were far from the stage, and it wasn't easy to catch the mistakes of the musicians he was seeing for the first time.

"The cellist's note wavered at the beginning of the second movement, and the horn player didn't properly perform the gestop in the third movement. The hand stopping, where you completely block the valve with your hand to produce a sharp metallic sound instead of a soft melody, wasn't done correctly. In the final movement, the conductor's beat was off. The conductor, who should act as the metronome, altered the performance in his own style instead of following the score. It's probably an old habit."

Baek Junghoon looked at me with surprised eyes.

How did I know? I had no idea either. At some point, like seeing the answers to a problem, the discordant melodies couldn't escape my ears and eyes.

By the way, Baek Junghoon's appearance was quite different from the 'Iron-blooded Maestro' I knew.

"Let's go up to the stage."

"The stage?"

"I told you, I need to check your condition, hyung."

When I stood up from the seat, the elderly conductor and the members of the city symphony orchestra greeted me warmly.

It was an orchestra I had met several times while in Korea. Especially the principal conductor and I communicated well.

"Hyun, how long have you been sitting in the audience?"

"Not long. The symphony just played was fantastic. I'm here because of something I mentioned yesterday. Is it okay?"

"Of course, it's okay. You've helped our orchestra so much, how could I not grant such a request?"

It could be considered a kind of mutual aid. I had found and corrected several issues with the Seoul City Symphony Orchestra. Now it was my turn to receive help.

I looked at Baek Junghoon, who was walking behind me. It was time to see what kind of conducting the Iron-blooded Maestro would show.

"How is Hyun these days?"

At Son Ilsung's question, Im Hyera opened her eyes in surprise.

"Hyun?"

"Yes, I heard he only goes to school these days."

"He seems like he will have another concert soon. Interestingly, he received a collaboration proposal. The reporters, how quickly they catch wind of these things, have already been contacting us. It's surprising that you're asking about Hyun."

Indeed, Son Ilsung usually showed little interest in anything related to Kang Hyun.

But Im Hyera felt that his interest in Kang Hyun had noticeably increased after Barbara's visit.

"Also, so many matchmakers were approaching Hyun, so I gave them a stern warning."

"A stern warning?"

"From Dongshin Group to various major corporations, so many people were trying to set Hyun up with their children that it was really becoming a problem. So, at a gathering of the wives, I issued a warning. If any matchmaker contacts us about Hyun's marriage again, Im Hyera of Jeil Group won't stand idly by. I think it will be quiet for a while now."

Son Ilsung showed a faint smile. Wasn't it Im Hyera who handled one of the biggest nuisances, the matchmakers, with ease?

Indeed, Im Hyera was the only one among the wives of major corporate heads who was still actively working.

Even many executives were in awe of her.

"What does Yooha think about college?"

"As I mentioned before, I think it's best for Yooha to go to college in the US and start working at Jeil Trading in Korea, but why do you ask?"

"I was thinking that studying in Korea might not be a bad idea."

A peculiar expression filled Im Hyera's eyes. Wasn't it her husband, Son Ilsung, who raised their child harshly like a lion throwing its cub off a cliff? Then Son Ilsung continued.

"Since we're at it, it might be good to hold an engagement ceremony with Hyun. It's what Father wishes for, after all."

It seems he, too, has started to show affection for his son-in-law.

* * *

Achoo!

Was it a cold? Baek Junghoon looked at me with worried eyes. But he should be worrying about himself, not me.

However, Baek Junghoon, who went on stage with the Seoul City Symphony Orchestra, was truly amazing.

"Hyung, you synced with the members so quickly. Honestly, I was really surprised. I didn't expect you to grasp the characteristics of the city symphony orchestra members so quickly."

"When you work as a guest conductor with various orchestras in Russia, you naturally get into the habit of understanding the members' individuality. Some Russian members, who dislike Asians, deliberately play differently during rehearsals and performances. After experiencing such people several times, my body naturally adapted."

Doesn't it seem like a scene from a spy movie? Just like a spy agent who enters a restaurant and instantly calculates the number of people and the quickest escape route, Baek Junghoon quickly grasped the state and characteristics of the members as soon as he got on stage.

"But it seemed like you were blocked by an invisible wall. Although you conducted perfectly, didn't a part of you feel very uneasy?"

"How did you know?"

"Your conducting was saying so. It felt like you were striving for perfection but also imitating someone."

Indeed, there was a significant difference from the maestro I remembered from my past life.

The 'Iron-blooded Maestro,' who used to show fierce charisma, now seemed distant. He was striving for perfect conducting but at the same time, it was evident that he was imitating someone.

I now understood why Maxim Ivanov had come to see me.

"Hyung, you have your own style. There's no need to imitate other famous conductors. For example, the principal conductor of the Seoul City Symphony Orchestra changes the beat in certain parts according to his habit. It's unimaginable for an ordinary orchestra, but he does it. It's his own style."

Baek Junghoon still seemed to not fully understand. It seemed he didn't yet know exactly what his style was.

Honestly, I wanted to recreate the 'Iron-blooded Maestro' I saw in my past life.

Back then, Baek Junghoon was older and much richer in melody, and sometimes extremely sharp. Like a seasoned veteran.

"Hyung, what piece do you want to conduct with me?"

"I was thinking it would be nice to use your symphony."

"My own composition?"

Suddenly, I thought about composing a symphony for Baek Junghoon. If I create a piece that suits the Iron-blooded Maestro, it might help him find his style. First, I should help with his posture.

"Hyung, I'll play the piano to replace the orchestra, so would you conduct?"

"Here?"

"Why not? It's just the two of us anyway."

Thanks to the director's consideration, we could borrow the concert hall of the Seoul Arts Center for a while.

With over two thousand seats empty, only Baek Junghoon and I stood alone on the stage with a piano.

After a brief moment of hesitation, Baek Junghoon nodded with a determined expression.
