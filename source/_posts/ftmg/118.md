The Stradivarius "Joy" shimmered as it exuded its presence. The intense staccato felt as though it might break the strings.

Determination overflowed as the bow ceaselessly moved.

How could one stop? "Joy" was cheering amidst the symphony of musical ideas, and the heart, beating incessantly, had returned to its youthful state.

It was then.

If it weren't for the timely knock, the queen's bow would never have stopped.

The queen smiled brightly as she greeted her manager, Goro. Goro's face clearly showed signs of distress. It was understandable, given the soundproofing was so perfect that not a single note leaked out of the practice room.

"Teacher, did I interrupt an important part?"

"It's okay. I haven't quite figured out how to play the next part anyway."

"You, Teacher?"

Wasn't she Hirose, known as the Queen of Strings? It seemed impossible that there could be a score she couldn't play.

"Hyun's composition is really difficult. Usually, I can play most pieces from memory after hearing them once, but this time it's not easy. I requested the sheet music, but the deeper I dive into it, the more unfathomable it becomes. It feels as if it's saying only he can play it."

"Is it that challenging?"

"Once Hyun officially releases his album, the classical music world will be abuzz. They will be amazed to encounter live notes instead of interpreting the works of the deceased."

A full smile spread across Hirose's face. She was also eagerly looking forward to the days ahead.

Hadn't the classical music world, which had been stagnant, been stirred by the wind named Hyun?

"Oh, by the way, Teacher. You've received a commercial proposal. It's for a public interest purpose, just like before. What should we do?"

"Do I have a choice?"

"There really aren't any musicians in the current music scene who can match your reputation, Teacher Hirose, so the broadcasting station is eager to have you, just like before. The newly appointed chairman of the committee even tried to visit the studio personally, but I firmly declined."

It must have been since the early 1990s when Japan's bubble economy collapsed, and social anxiety was high.

To dispel the nationwide anxiety and fear of prolonged recession, sports stars and famous musicians began shooting public service advertisements.

In a way, it was an exclusive privilege only for those with the most positive influence in Japan.

"Goro, let's proceed. The tougher the times, the more we need to work together."

"By the way, Teacher, I heard that Korea is also shooting a similar public service advertisement. Their situation isn't good either. Interestingly, I heard they're featuring a musician first. The musician appearing might be…"

Hirose didn't need to hear the rest of Goro's words to know who it was. Who else could have the most positive influence in the current Korean classical music scene, if not him?

Zing.

Even though I had only tuned the violin, it felt like all eyes were on me. Every staff member on set was looking at me in wonder.

Among them, the one looking at me the most intensely was none other than the director. I heard he was a fervent fan of mine, and judging by his eyes, it seemed true. Such a rapturous expression even for a simple tuning.

"Kang Hyun, are you really okay with proceeding according to the storyboard?"

"Yes, Director. Don’t worry, and proceed as planned."

The director looked at me worriedly. It was understandable since, according to the storyboard, I had to play until the violin strings broke.

"Kang Hyun, you really don't seem like a high school student. You're the same age as my nephew, but your speech and actions make you seem as mature as someone my age. Have you done this kind of shoot often?"

"No, this is my first commercial shoot."

"Really? During the rehearsal just now, you seemed so accustomed to the camera angles and walking patterns that I must have been mistaken. Today is a public service ad, but I guarantee that once the economy improves, big companies will line up to cast you. I can assure you of that."

It was understandable why the director was puzzled. In my past life, while preparing to be a member of the National Assembly, I had received all kinds of lessons. Among them were lessons on camera angles and dignified walking patterns.

Given that it was a career often seen on television, appearances mattered more than actual work for the public.

'Please take good care of me.'

I picked up the violin. Of course, it wasn't the Stradivarius or Guarnerius I usually used.

As I took my position, the surroundings became instantly silent. Not only the staff but also the cameras capturing me became a single audience, completely engrossed.

Hyun, the Queen's Portamento.

As the bow slowly touched the strings, the sound of someone swallowing hard became an accompaniment.

Like a double-faced coin, at times, a poignant melody pierced the ears, and at other times, a magnificent melody reached the ceiling.

It was then.

Zing―!

Following the mesmerizing glissando, the bow fiercely crossed the strings.

At that moment, as the bow pressed hard against the strings, the first E string snapped.

If I loosened my grip even a little, the tension would cause not only the bridge but also the bow to bounce off.

But the bow continued to fiercely cross the strings.

An unrivaled melody surged with faster bowing, like a sharp blade.

As if it was just beginning.

Gulp―!

The director, reviewing the previous shoot's footage, gulped hard. It was because the visual quality exceeded the storyboard.

Sometimes, when general models didn't understand the shooting angles, they had to adjust the lighting, but not today.

Moreover, how was the sound? It was so enchanting that I wanted to keep listening.

Even the staff, who had no interest in classical music, couldn't take their eyes off and gaped in awe. What more could I say?

"Kang Hyun, I never imagined the shoot would end in one take. Usually, it takes at least half a day, sometimes several days if it's difficult."

"Did the footage turn out well? I couldn't really tell."

It wasn't about underestimating myself. In any field, subjective and objective views are distinctly different.

However, the director waved his hand vigorously.

"Not only did it turn out well, but honestly, I'm heartbroken. I came to the shoot excited, thinking I could listen to your performance all day, but who knew we'd get it in one take."

"Director, should I play another piece for you?"

"What?"

The director's voice rose involuntarily. Other staff members also licked their lips.

There were several violins prepared, so there was no problem, and it didn't matter if I played a few more pieces. However, the director repeatedly asked if it was really okay.

"It's okay, Director. I neglected my practice a bit after the solo concert. I'm actually grateful. I'm glad you like my humble performance."

"Kang Hyun, you're not lacking at all. Not at all. I'm not a musician, but it's not easy to move the audience's hearts like this. The same goes for being a director; we need to move the viewers' hearts through the screen. In that sense, your public service ad will move many people's hearts. I'm sure of it."

A violinist who continues to perform their own music despite the old violin strings breaking and only one string remaining.

The director, who had been staring at the finished product, added quietly.

"South Korea needs a hero more than ever."

* * *

Was it because a tiger was getting married? Despite the warm sunlight, raindrops started falling, one by one.

I could see Mr. Kim, the driver, hesitating whether to turn on the wipers. Anyway.

'Life sure is full of surprises.'

No, come to think of it, it's the opposite. All of this was possible because I had returned to life.

Regardless, who would have thought I'd end up shooting a commercial? And not just any commercial, but a public service ad like those shot by sports stars Park Seri and Park Chan-ho.

After the video shoot, I spent quite some time wrestling with the microphone to record the cheesy lines.

"Kang Hyun, we're heading to Pyeongchang-dong, right?"

"Yes, sir."

The reason for heading to Pyeongchang-dong after the commercial shoot was because Chairman Wang and Grandfather were both there.

How shocked I was when I learned about the reality of VH Company in Grandfather's study.

It was a perfect example of the saying, "There's always a bigger fish." The ability to draw a blueprint far exceeded the realm of ordinary people. After all, they were giants in the business world who had endured turbulent times.

"Sir, does Aunt still visit Ichon-dong often these days?"

"Of course, she visits frequently even when you're not around. It'd be better if she only came to Ichon-dong. She seems to visit the company often as well."

She thought she was being clever, but she was just testing the waters.

Usually, Grandfather would have scolded her harshly, not sparing her despite being a woman. But this time, he didn't.

It meant that no matter how much she tried, she was still in Grandfather's grasp.

"The traffic is a bit heavy."

It was then.

Bang―!

As soon as Mr. Kim finished speaking, there was a loud noise ahead on Gangbyeonbuk-ro, and all the cars came to a sudden stop. It looked like a chain-reaction collision had occurred, with the cars tangled up.

"Kang Hyun, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. Are you okay, sir?"

"My shoulder feels a bit stiff, but I'm not seriously injured."

When Mr. Kim and I got out of the car, the eight-lane road was already a mess.

Because of that, everyone who had been in their cars got out and headed for the shoulder. As I was about to leave the road.

Bang―!

There was another loud noise, and one of the cars caught fire. People were visibly panicking and evacuating from the accident area.

It seemed there were no casualties, as no one was visible inside the car.

"Help!"

At that moment, a child tugged at my sleeve, crying. Next to me, an old man who had been sitting in the driver's seat of a Tico seemed to have twisted his leg and couldn't walk properly.

Without hesitation, I approached the old man and offered him my back.

"Grandfather, please climb on."

It was too difficult to ask Mr. Kim, given that he seemed to have injured his shoulder more severely than he let on.

Eventually, the old man repeatedly thanked me as he climbed onto my back. The child, who seemed to be his grandchild, clung closely to my side.

"Still, it seems we're fortunate there were no casualties in such a big accident."

Just as Mr. Kim said, despite the chain-reaction collision on the eight-lane road, most people had gotten out of their cars.

I could see paramedics rushing over from a distance to extinguish the burning car. It was then.

"A camera?"

There were not only evacuees on the shoulder but also broadcast reporters. It seemed that a broadcasting vehicle had been involved in the accident.

As I was walking out with the injured old man on my back.

"Huh?"
