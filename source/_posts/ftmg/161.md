The mansion in Ichon-dong is filled with people since morning. The savory smell tickling the nose suggests that cooking is in full swing.

In celebration of the end of the College Scholastic Ability Test, everyone has decided to have a meal together. Even those who don't usually visit Ichon-dong are here today.

"Alright, everyone, let's start."

At Grandfather's words, everyone picked up their spoons.

Even my aunt, who used to chatter a lot, was eating breakfast quietly like a noble lady today.

The same went for my uncle. Hasn't he been demoted and sent to a local factory for a while? His face has become haggard and gaunt, but what can he do? It's all because of his own actions.

"Hyun, how was the College Scholastic Ability Test?"

When Mother carefully asked, all eyes on the table turned to me.

Mother even visited temples to pray right after I entered the exam hall. She was so worried that her son might have done poorly on the test that she couldn't even bring herself to ask.

How did the test go?

"I solved all the questions I knew."

There were no questions I didn't know. When I gave a faint smile, Mother finally sighed in relief.

At that moment, my aunt chimed in.

"Hyun, where are you planning to go to college? You probably couldn't study properly for a while. If you mess up this exam, how about studying abroad instead?"

"Like Jinseok hyung?"

"Yes, like Jinseok. Studying abroad isn't a bad option. Father, you won't believe how fluent Jinseok is in English. If we had known he had such a talent for languages, we might have considered making him a diplomat. By the way, he said he'd come to Ichon-dong right after arriving at the airport."

Surely, even if I solved the questions with my feet, I would have done better than Yoo Jinseok.

My aunt seemed to be regaining her usual self as her worries subsided.

Grandfather didn't respond to my aunt's words and continued to look at me.

"Hyun, did you mention to your doctor about getting another thorough examination?"

"Yes, Grandfather."

"Haha, because of my grandson, this old man might live a long and healthy life."

In my past life, Grandfather passed away when I was 19. The memories are still vivid.

At Grandfather's first funeral, Mother was shedding tears, and the uncles and aunts, who called themselves siblings, were glaring at each other, obsessed with dividing the inheritance.

"This time, don't skip it because you're busy. Make sure you go and get the thorough examination."

"Alright, rascal."

Grandfather's complexion was so bright that it was hard to believe he was over seventy. He looked twenty years younger than his age, to say the least.

His gait was steady, and his eyes were sharp and full of vitality. It was as if he was experiencing a second prime.

In this life, I must strive not to repeat the mistakes of my past life. At that moment,

"Grandfather, I'm here."

Yoo Jinseok had arrived at Ichon-dong. At the same time, the family's gazes narrowed. My aunt was so surprised that she couldn't close her mouth. Even my oldest uncle clicked his tongue.

The reason was simple. Yoo Jinseok had piercings in his ears, and his hair was dyed yellow.

After the meal, during a brief tea time, I walked to the second floor with Yoo Jinseok and spoke.

"Hyung, you're not learning anything weird while studying abroad, are you?"

"What?"

When I first met Yoo Jinseok years ago, it was hard to believe that such a timid guy would later commit fraud and embezzlement.

However, after Yoo Jinseok returned from studying abroad, his face now looked familiar.

"If you mess around, I won't let it slide."

His thug-like attire was exactly like the Yoo Jinseok I had encountered as a petty criminal at the West District Prosecutor's Office in my past life. Didn't he beg me to save him after committing fraud and embezzlement?

When I gave him a stern look, Yoo Jinseok seemed to recall past memories and gulped hard.

"Teacher, how do you like it?"

Hirose seemed quite pleased with the Seoul Arts Center Concert Hall. No wonder, the extensive reconstruction had been completed.

Architectural design that eliminated dead spots in acoustics and exceptional external beauty were results of efforts to shed the past reputation of being called an "arts bathhouse."

"Hyun, it's like a mix of Suntory Hall and Tokyo Opera City."

"Is it really that good?"

"I haven't played the violin yet, so I can't fully feel it, but it certainly looks that way. I never imagined there would be such a wonderful concert hall in Korea, our neighboring country."

It was no less impressive compared to the Seoul Arts Center in my memory. This indicated that history had indeed changed.

The director of the Seoul Arts Center, standing in the back, had a very moved expression. He seemed to understand a bit of Japanese.

"Hyun, you'll be an adult soon. How about going on a world tour?"

"A world tour? That's too much praise."

"I've always felt that you underestimate yourself too much. If you knew how much classical music fans around the world are waiting for you, you'd be surprised. Even Japanese music professors I know occasionally ask about you. That's how much mystery you hold in the classical world."

Mysterious figure, indeed. Though unintentional, that's how I've been perceived. Since I disappeared after the royal performance in England two years ago, people must be very curious.

At that moment, the white-haired queen walked to the center of the stage.

"Hyun, shall we play the violin here?"

Here?

Hirose seemed very moved by the Seoul Arts Center Concert Hall. Although there was no proper audience, she liked the place so much that she couldn't resist playing the violin right away.

When I conveyed this to the director, he wholeheartedly agreed with a beaming smile.

Of course, the queen's performance isn't something you can hear just anywhere.

"Hyun, can I play with you?"

"Teacher, what piece shall we play?"

"Of course, we should play one of your compositions. Every time I see the sheet music for your duet for two violins, my heart races. It feels like a piece made for joy and fantasy."

Indeed, when I composed the piece for two violins, I had joy and fantasy in mind. Moreover, I had brought the violin to assess the concert hall's condition.

Soon, two Stradivari violins, with starkly contrasting tones and appearances, were revealed.

Only the director of the Seoul Arts Center was seated in the audience. His face now showed not just emotion but also awe.

Gang Hyun Concerto for Two Violins.

At that moment, the two Stradivari violins gleamed as if competing with each other's melody.

"Teacher, may I ask why you visited Korea during your sabbatical?"

Kim Saetbyeol from DailyQ was holding her notebook tightly as she conducted the interview.

Her face was brimming with excitement and anticipation, much more than usual. She was so nervous that she even brought an interpreter.

It was no wonder, as sitting across from her was Hirose, known as the queen of Hyun.

"It's for a duet performance with violinist Hyun."

Kim Saetbyeol felt a rush of joy inside. The outcome she had anticipated had become a reality.

Until now, Hirose had never moved for a duet performance. She had even moved during her sabbatical for this duet.

"I've been waiting for this duet with Hyun for a long time. From the moment I first met him, I wished to play the violin with him."

"May I ask when you first met him?"

"It was exactly five years ago at the Tokyo Opera City Concert Hall. I was so enamored with a video from Korea that I desperately searched for the child in the video as if I had lovesickness. When I saw him on the Opera City stage, my heart raced uncontrollably. And when our eyes met, it felt like time had stopped."

That day was still vividly etched in Hirose's mind.

Didn't she slowly lift her bow and point at Hyun, who was seated in the center of the audience?

It felt like Beethoven's Hymn of Fate was ringing in her head.

"Teacher, could you comment on the piece you'll be performing with Kang Hyun this time?"

"It's one of Hyun's compositions."

"A composition by him?"

Kim Saetbyeol's voice rose involuntarily.

Kang Hyun's compositions were already famous among classical musicians.

His first album, filled with his compositions, was so renowned that it was considered a masterpiece by Gramophone.

She wanted to know more about his compositions, but Hirose remained tight-lipped. How much time had passed?

The interview continued and was nearing its end with only the final question remaining.

"Could you share your thoughts on Kang Hyun's compositions, Ms. Hirose?"

"My thoughts, huh."

The queen smiled pleasantly, recalling Kang Hyun's workspace. Wasn't it piled high with sheet music?

Although they seemed like ordinary scores, each one was filled with notes that were incredibly impactful.

"When Hyun's numerous musical ideas are revealed to the world, many classical musicians will rejoice."

Just as musicians did when they first encountered the scores of Beethoven, Mozart, and Rachmaninoff.

"We've arrived, Kang Hyun."

The scene at the high school after the College Scholastic Ability Test was as relaxed as could be. Especially for third-year high school students, it was practically free time.

But today, the students' faces were filled with tension and excitement. It was the day the results of the College Scholastic Ability Test were announced.

They might know their scores from preliminary marking, but everyone was anxious about whether their OMR answer sheets were filled out correctly.

"According to the Ministry of Education's guidelines, the test results will be announced before lunch, so let's all wait a little longer."

Even the homeroom teacher's face was full of tension. Of course, today was the day to put the final period on their college entrance journey.

Every teacher would want their students to do well.

At that moment, the homeroom teacher glanced at me. He had asked me about my preliminary scores before.

At that time, I had made an excuse that I hadn't copied the answers for preliminary marking because I was too busy during the test. I felt sorry for the teacher, but I didn't appreciate unnecessary fuss.

"Hyun, could it be that you got a perfect score?"

"Why?"

"I'm so nervous I feel like dying, but you look too relaxed."

The girl class president sitting next to me asked with a grim face. She was the one who often ranked second in the class.

"Minjeong, you're aiming for the law department at Korea University, right?"

"Yes, I must go to the law department. You know, my dream is to become a public defender."

I had some acquaintance with Minjeong. Honestly, I was quite surprised when she sat next to me in the third year of high school.

Wasn't she my classmate in the law department at Korea University in my past life? Come to think of it, she entered the Judicial Research and Training Institute one term after me.

Back then, I couldn't understand why Kim Minjeong chose the path of a public defender. It seemed like she was taking a difficult road, leaving the bright path behind.

But looking back, I realized that it was I who hadn't lived my life properly.

"Don't worry, Minjeong. You can definitely make it."

Kim Minjeong's cheeks turned red. At that moment, the homeroom teacher re-entered the classroom with a flushed face.

The teacher distributed the test result slips to the students one by one. But he didn't give one to me.

Just as I was filled with curiosity,

"There is a student in our class who got a perfect score on the College Scholastic Ability Test."

The homeroom teacher looked at me with a face full of emotion. The other students did the same.

Before long, the voice of the principal shouting "Kang Hyun!" overlapped and echoed in my ears.

The homeroom teacher approached me, grabbed my shoulders, and proudly shouted,
