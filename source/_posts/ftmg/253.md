To Reach the Sun, to Reach the Sun, like rising illusionsâ€•!

The Russian maestro, Viktor, was tilting his glass and enjoying a symphony. It was the Gang Hyun Symphony No. 1, which had recently swept the Billboard charts.

Starting with the prelude of horns and strings, the rising melody was flawless. It was a piece that brought out the charm of orchestral music, as if pursuing the ideal world of a musician.

There were critics who compared Gang Hyun Symphony No. 1 to Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor, the "Choral". The grand and majestic hymn indeed had similarities to the Choral.

The surprising element was the storytelling in the first and fourth movements. The melody, which was as fresh as a child's steps, became the grand steps of a giant.

It was understandable why so many music critics were praising Kang Hyun's symphony.

"Damn it."

Although reluctant to admit it, from the composition of the movements to the finale, the piece itself was worthy of being considered a masterpiece.

"Violinist Hyun."

He was a virtuoso, called as the final judge. Viktor had strongly opposed it, but the other judges had unanimously agreed to invite Kang Hyun as a judge. There was no more room for opposition.

"Evaluating others is not just about playing well!"

Viktor nervously gulped down his drink. The biting sensation of vodka flowed down his throat like reversing lava, but instead of feeling hot, it felt lukewarm like plain water.

It was only natural to feel that way about sitting alongside a young man barely over twenty as a judge.

He would have preferred Nikolai, even with his alcohol dependence.

-If he is not qualified to sit as a judge, I will immediately expel him.

It was a stern warning. Even if he was recognized as a violinist, if he lacked the discretion to evaluate others, he should be ready to leave the judge's seat immediately.

Other maestros, knowing Viktor's nature, did not argue further.

Clink.

The symphony ended, and the glass was placed down with a sound. In Viktor's blurry vision, the face of Kang Hyun, whom he had never seen before, flashed.

It was impossible not to know the face of the person who had stirred up the classical music world.

Viktor sneered. Fine, let's see how outstanding he is.

* * *

Rustle.

Was someone cursing?

"You rascal, where's your mind while playing Go?"

"Someone must be cursing me. My ear suddenly itches."

"Ha ha, now you're making lame jokes to stall time. Lately, whenever I turn on the TV, it's all praises for you, Hyun."

Kang Hyun looked down at the Go board. Chairman Wang's competitive spirit was no less than that of a young man. Otherwise, how could his Go skills have improved so much? It's likely that while Hyun was abroad, he received daily lessons from a professional Go player.

"Grandfather, your Go skills have improved a lot."

"Ha ha, can you tell?"

"In the past, I could see gaps, but now I can't see any at all."

"Of course. How long has it been since I learned from the master? And I even learned from the teacher. We played so much Go together before he returned to Jirisan that I can't even remember. Now, I can beat even you with three stones handicapped."

Chairman Wang's spirit was high. This was evident just by looking at the state of the Go board. From the beginning, the black stones had the advantage. Even in the fierce battle in the lower right corner during the midgame, the black stones maintained the upper hand. At this rate, it was clear that Kang Hyun would lose.

However, Kang Hyun's face showed no signs of anxiety or impatience. It was the composure of a master who oversaw the entire Go board.

Clack.

The white stone held by Kang Hyun's long fingers was placed without hesitation. It boldly penetrated the black stone's territory, like a general charging into the enemy camp.

Was it a losing move? But there was not a single twitch on Kang Hyun's face. Chairman Wang, unable to hide his puzzled expression, began to read the moves slowly.

"What?"

"If black can defend the territory with this move, it will gain the upper hand. If the gate is breached, white will take the lead. Didn't someone say that no matter how chaotic and complicated the situation is, one move can decide the outcome?"

"Who said that?"

"I just made it up."

Go was indeed a game that perfectly fit the saying that life is full of ups and downs. It might seem that black has the advantage, but isn't white immediately targeting the gaps?

In the persistent chase on the Go board, it was eventually Chairman Wang who placed the stone.

"You rascal, you never let your grandfather win."

"Grandfather, I almost lost this time. I might lose next time."

"You smooth talker. By the way, when are you going to Belgium?"

"I think I'll leave in about fifteen days. Honestly, I'm still in a daze about being invited as a judge. Even now, the media is continuously reporting on my invitation to be a judge for the competition. There's so much talk."

While many spoke of national prestige, others had diverse opinions on whether Kang Hyun was too young for such an important role.

"I believe you'll do well, Hyun. Age doesn't necessarily improve judgment. Your judgment is trustworthy."

Chairman Wang acknowledged Hyun's discernment. Indeed, VH Company, which Kang Hyun had nurtured, was now well-known in the investment industry.

Though externally, Director Kim Sang-guk was the representative, the actual investment operations and directions were led by Kang Hyun.

"By the way, Hyun, shouldn't you visit the company?"

It was well-known that VH Company had its headquarters in Korea.

Many stockbrokers had eagerly sought to join VH Company at one point. It was the first time the stock market had been so agitated since the financial crisis.

"The company?"

Hyun scratched his head. Though he was the de facto head of VH Company, he was not its face. Many in the public still believed Director Kim Sang-guk to be the representative.

* * *

VH Company's Korean headquarters was located in Yeouido, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul.

The exterior was modest compared to other large investment firms.

It made sense. The number of employees was small, and the main investment targets were overseas rather than domestic.

However, the number of people wanting to join this company was immense. Known figures like Director Kim Sang-guk, who had previously headed the strategic planning office of Jeil Group, were part of the company.

The dozens of subordinates under Director Kim Sang-guk were also known to be prominent figures in domestic companies.

The reason for this eagerness to join VH Company was simple.

Besides the salary and benefits, VH Company's future growth potential was immense. It was already regarded overseas as a company with the "Midas touch."

"Yay!"

New employee Kim Hyun-a, who was in charge of the VH Company's desk, also started her first day with high hopes.

All employees at VH Company exuded intelligence. The intellectual aura was evident from their appearance.

At the top was undoubtedly Director Kim Sang-guk. His chiseled jaw and sharp eyes resembled a character from a Hong Kong noir film.

His charisma was such that he was the object of unrequited love for many female employees at VH Company. At that moment,

"Excuse me."

A man with a hat pulled down low approached the desk. Though puzzled, Kim Hyun-a responded according to the set manual.

"Yes, how can I help you?"

"I came to meet Director Kim Sang-guk. Ah, his title has changed now."

"What?"

The man addressed Director Kim Sang-guk as if he were a neighborhood friend.

At first, she thought he might be strange and was about to call the security guard waiting in the lobby, but the man's eyes under the hat brim made her hesitate.

It felt like facing a deep, clear lake. His eyes exuded an aura no less than that of Director Kim Sang-guk.

Gulp.

The man pulled his hat down further, perhaps conscious of Kim Hyun-a's gaze or the surrounding attention.

'What's this?'

Momentarily taken aback, Kim Hyun-a regained her senses.

"Do you have an appointment with Director Kim Sang-guk?"

"No, I didn't contact him beforehand. It seems he's in a meeting right now."

"Then you don't have a prior appointment with Director Kim Sang-guk. Can you tell me why you need to meet him?"

People frequently came to meet Director Kim Sang-guk. Some sought him for job opportunities, while others falsely claimed past connections.

According to protocol, the man in front of her should also be turned away from the lobby. After all, he didn't look like an employee. Judging by his flawless skin, he didn't seem that old either.

What lingered in her mind was the glimpse of his eyes under the hat brim.

'Sigh.'

Kang Hyun licked his dry lips. The hat drawn low to avoid reporters had become a problem. He didn't contact Director Kim Sang-guk before visiting the Yeouido VH Company headquarters for a simple reason.

'Who makes an appointment to visit their own home?'

Kang Hyun was the actual owner of VH Company.

However, very few employees at the headquarters had seen his face. Only a select few led by Director Kim Sang-guk had met him.

Consequently, most employees at the desk or in general departments didn't know of Kang Hyun's existence. With the help of Jeil Group, it hadn't been widely reported in Korea.

Although he wanted to reveal his identity and say, "I'm the representative here," he couldn't. Yeouido was a place where rumors spread like wildfire. The whispers of stockbrokers traveled faster than a galloping horse.

Just as he was about to call Director Kim Sang-guk again,

"Any updates from the Austrian Dream? What happened to Hong Kong's Wang Wei, whom we met a few days ago?"

A familiar voice reached his ears. Director Kim Sang-guk, walking with his subordinates, stopped at the desk, puzzled as he glanced at the man in the hat.

Director Kim Sang-guk's eyes widened, then grew even larger.
