"Yooha―!"

Michelle excitedly called out Son Yooha's name.

"You got first place!"

On the bulletin board, Son Yooha's name was proudly displayed at the top, meaning she was at the top of her grade.

It wasn't really surprising. Son Yooha always took first place as if it were a given.

"I don't know how you never miss being first. Do you know how frustrated Kaya gets? She always grumbles about being second forever. If you win the school popularity contest too, Kaya might completely give up on ever being first."

"It's still not enough."

"What?"

Son Yooha always thought she wasn't enough. Poverty is relative, after all.

Compared to Kang Hyun, she felt as small as a firefly in front of the sun. Kang Hyun had already achieved unimaginable success for someone his age.

At that moment,

"Excuse me for a second!"

A handsome male student suddenly blocked the path of Son Yooha and Michelle. In his hand were a single rose and a letter.

Michelle immediately understood the situation. It wasn't the first time she had experienced this while hanging out with Yooha.

"Thank you for the gift, but I'm sorry."

Son Yooha's firm response made the boy's face twist. No wonder, many boys at Phillips had tried but none had ever won Son Yooha's heart.

But this boy seemed unwilling to give up easily.

"I heard you don't have a boyfriend, so why do you always reject everyone so coldly?"

"You heard I don't have a boyfriend?"

"Yeah, it's a famous story at Phillips. Despite not having a boyfriend, Son Yooha doesn’t accept any boy's advances."

No wonder there were even rumors that Son Yooha liked girls instead of boys. She had even received a few love letters from younger female students because of it.

Son Yooha shook her head in disbelief and looked the boy straight in the eye.

"Sorry, but I do have one."

"What?"

"A boyfriend!"

The boy froze as if he had turned into a fossil. The surrounding students were equally shocked.

Son Yooha had never revealed that she had a boyfriend before. The hallway soon buzzed with noise like a marketplace.

As they passed through the crowd and got some breathing space, Michelle looked at Yooha and asked,

"Yooha, are you going to England again this summer break?"

Every summer break, Yooha would go to England to study royal studies and management.

"No, I'm not going this year."

But this time was different. She had someone she wanted to spend the summer break with.

Someone once said that the romance of college life lies in the campus and alcohol.

Even if you were to get an FF grade tomorrow, a drink with friends could wash away all worries.

But Kang Hyun was different.

As soon as he entered the Law Department of Korea University, he started preparing for the bar exam. He didn’t even have enough time to read the law books, so he rarely drank with his peers.

He had no memories left from his college life. His peers and even his seniors called him a "beast."

"Hyun-ah―!"

As soon as he entered the pub, Kim Daewoo stood up and waved.

The large pub was already packed with students. Upon closer inspection, there were not only his peers but also some seniors.

By now, it was only natural for all eyes to focus on Kang Hyun's arrival.

"You made it just in time. Here, have a drink―!"

An unknown female senior approached and handed him a draft beer. Next to her, Kim Daewoo mouthed the words "club president."

Only then did he remember. She was a senior called Yeongmi, who was often referred to as a heroine because she rarely wore makeup. But today, she had put on enough makeup that he didn't recognize her.

"Hyun-ah, did you know all the female peers and seniors in our department put a lot of effort into their makeup today?"

"Huh?"

"Look, even Yeongmi, who doesn’t usually wear mascara or lipstick, and all the female peers are dressed up. I thought there was an end-of-year awards ceremony or something."

Looking around as Kim Daewoo suggested, he saw that even the usually plain-dressed female students were wearing fluttering dresses.

"Daewoo, is there a dress code for department meetings?"

"Dress code? No way, it’s all because of you, Hyun. Do you know how much of a ruckus it caused in the department room when they heard you were attending the end-of-term party?"

"What?"

It was certainly a different life compared to his past. He received more attention now than when he passed the bar exam and was called a beast.

It was common to find fan letters in Kang Hyun's locker, and gifts were even delivered to the department office for him.

"Hyun, you must have saved Korea in your previous life. How else could you be so perfect? Not only were you the top scorer for university entrance, but you also monopolize the love of your peers and seniors. Wow."

Though he once threw himself in front of a subway in his past life, he didn’t save Korea. Moreover, the reason seniors liked Kang Hyun, who didn’t participate in departmental activities, was surprisingly simple.

Because he always provided necessary items for the department room, life there was very comfortable.

Even though it was a small act of kindness from Kang Hyun’s perspective, it was significant for the university students.

"Everyone, attention―!"

With the club president’s toast, the end-of-term party began. A karaoke machine appeared from somewhere, though it wasn’t clear where it had been prepared.

Since the entire pub was rented out by the department, it didn’t matter.

"Senior, I’ll sing a song!"

The sociable Kim Daewoo stood up and took the microphone. Soon, the nostalgic prelude of a trot song echoed through the ceiling. His skillful performance enlivened the atmosphere.

Kang Hyun thought he wouldn’t be envious of Na Hoon-a if he wore a tight shirt and bell-bottom pants. At that moment,

"Hyun, now it’s your turn to sing!"

"Huh?"

"This time, our department’s superstar Kang Hyun will perform!"

Kim Daewoo’s unexpected action resulted in a thunderous cheer. The female students' eyes were already filled with excitement.

No wonder, no one had ever seen Kang Hyun, a violinist, sing before.

It’s said that compliments can make even a whale dance. Eventually, Kang Hyun stood up and took the microphone.

With plenty of stage experience, there was no reason to be nervous. As he smiled naturally, the surrounding erupted with screams. It was another moment that stirred the hearts of the female students.

"PD Kim―!"

The director's voice was full of excitement. No wonder, the documentary trailer about Kang Hyun and Baek Junghoon had become a nationwide sensation.

The director, who resembled a bulldog, hugged PD Kim Dohyun tightly in admiration. The atmosphere in the newsroom was as festive as a party.

"I knew PD Kim would make it big someday! The trailer response is so hot it’s almost burning. Can you imagine that we’re getting calls about the documentary from early in the morning?"

It wasn’t an exaggeration. Even the general public called the newsroom to inquire about the airing time of the Kang Hyun and Baek Junghoon documentary.

"Can you make it into two parts?"

"Director, two parts?"

"Yes, the president is also very interested. If the content is solid, a two or even three-part series is fine."

PD Kim Dohyun was stunned. Initially, it had been planned as a one-off program. It was rare for a regular documentary to be extended to two or three parts.

"Do you have enough content?"

"Yes, we do. Although the filming period was short, there are many impactful scenes."

He had let out happy screams in the editing room. To be precise, there was nothing to discard from scene to scene.

Especially Kang Hyun’s appearance was so captivating that even PD Kim Dohyun, who had been in the broadcasting industry for a long time, found him appealing.

"Alright, I’ll support you fully this time, so do whatever you want."

"Thank you, Director!"

At that moment, the TV in the newsroom was broadcasting the documentary trailer.

Images of Kang Hyun and Baek Junghoon alternated, and they looked no less attractive than actors.

Especially Kang Hyun’s charisma was palpable even through the screen.

Though he was young, he exuded charisma that captivated countless members instantly.

Especially the scenes of him conducting were so elegant and beautiful that they seemed like scenes from a movie.

Once the documentary aired, it was likely that the advertising industry and even Chungmuro would want to cast Kang Hyun.

And there was more. The highlight was still to come. As the scene transitioned from conducting to Kang Hyun heading to university in everyday clothes, hanging out with friends, and attending classes,

-Do you have a girlfriend, Mr. Kang Hyun?

The last question, along with a close-up of a flustered Kang Hyun, ended the trailer.

* * *

"Does he really have one?"

The concert hall of the Seoul Arts Center was bustling from the morning. Members of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra were preparing their instruments for practice.

Among them, especially the female members, were discussing a common topic with excited faces.

"Don't you know how TV people work yet? They edit it provocatively to boost ratings."

"Yeah, I don't think Kang Hyun has a girlfriend either."

"I'm sure he doesn't. If he did, would he practice so late every night?"

It was all because of the last scene of the documentary trailer. The question about whether Kang Hyun had a girlfriend ended the trailer, leaving a lingering curiosity like a blackout during a crucial movie scene.

At that moment,

"Rehearsal starting."

Kang Hyun appeared on stage. Although he was the youngest, the members felt an inexplicable sense of awe towards him.

Even the notoriously prickly concertmaster turned into a meek lamb when talking to Kang Hyun, so it was no surprise that other members felt the same.

"Viola―!"

As always, Kang Hyun precisely pointed out the mistakes of the members.

The members were spooked. At first, they thought it was a coincidence, but the more they practiced, the more they realized how sharp Kang Hyun's hearing was.

When he instantly noticed the old habit of the timpani player, some members even compared his musical talent to Mozart’s.

Thud, thud, thud.

His fingertips moved sharply through the air instead of a baton.

While reciting the beat, he looked at the performers. He especially signaled to the string section members who couldn’t see the concertmaster clearly.

His proficiency was unbelievable for a 20-year-old conductor. The orchestra's synchronization was as stable as when they performed with their resident conductor.

How much time had passed?

Even though quite some time had passed, the members did not look tired.

In fact, practicing with Kang Hyun seemed to boost their adrenaline.

"Should I ask him?"

During the break, curiosity arose among the members. They wondered if Kang Hyun truly had a girlfriend, as implied in the documentary trailer.

Eventually, a violist mustered the courage to ask Kang Hyun, who was looking at the score on the podium.

"Conductor, did you see the documentary trailer yesterday?"

"Yes, I saw it."

"So, do you really have a girlfriend?"

In an instant, all eyes were on him. Even the male members were curious, focusing as if awaiting exam results.

Just as Kang Hyun smiled and was about to answer,

Huh?

His lips stopped. His eyes shook as if he couldn't believe what he was seeing. The reason was simple.

"Yooha?"
