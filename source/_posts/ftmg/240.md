-Hollywood's renowned director Jim Filmer has reportedly selected violinist Kang Hyun as the music director for his next film, 'Horror.' It's truly astounding that 20-year-old Kang Hyun was chosen by such a master director and not a rookie in Hollywood. Furthermore, other renowned directors have also expressed their desire to work with Kang Hyun. Let's hear from Han Ji-won, the president of the Korean Film Association, regarding this matter.

-It's indeed astonishing. However, Kang Hyun has already showcased his talent as a music director in the French film 'La Vie en Rose' and the Italian-German co-produced film 'Paganini.' Perhaps that's why Kang Hyun has been quite popular among filmmakers for a long time. I understand that many directors from Hollywood, as well as from Chungmuro, have been sending love calls to Kang Hyun for years. This is unprecedented for an Asian musician.

-Does this mean that Kang Hyun's current popularity in Hollywood, which is causing a stir, might last longer and not just flicker like a meteor shower? According to news from Hollywood, Director Jim Filmer couldn't stop praising the inserted song composed by Kang Hyun, calling it the climax of his cinematic career.

The anchor's voice was evidently excited. Unsurprisingly, the excited emotion was also visible on the wrinkled face of Han Ji-won, the president of the Korean Film Association.

And for a good reason, as there were hardly any musicians in the Korean film industry who had left such a strong impression.

Han Ji-won nodded vigorously as if in agreement and began to speak.

-I can confidently say that having such a genius appear in Korea is truly a blessing for the country.

* * *

I suddenly wondered how Hollywood's top actors live under such attention.

From the beginning, the situation had garnered a lot of media attention due to numerous love calls from Hollywood directors, but not to this extent.

Perhaps because of the rumor that "the big hand that moved Barbara Tannenbaum is none other than the violinist Hyun!" paparazzi had even started to appear.

As expected, somehow they had figured out the location of the studio and were lurking around.

Because of that, Im Hyera had to personally find another studio for me.

"Hyun……?!"

Even earlier, while buying a sandwich, I made eye contact with an unknown paparazzo.

One would usually be flustered when making eye contact, but the paparazzo, upon seeing my face hidden under the hat, hurriedly picked up their camera.

I can understand why many Hollywood stars raise their middle fingers at paparazzi.

I wanted to approach the paparazzo and smash the camera, but doing so would surely be captured by another paparazzo.

Damn it!

I barely managed to shake off the paparazzo and arrived at the new studio.

Paparazzi feel like endless ants in an ant nest. To them, I must be a very sweet sugar.

"Should I leave New York quickly……."

In Korea, I wouldn't attract this much attention. Given the deep-rooted Confucian society in Korea, paparazzi wouldn't be so rampant. Anyway.

"Soo's wedding, huh."

I heard that the wedding of Soo, the eldest son of Geumwang Group, is happening in New York today.

Once, after landing at an airport in the UK, I was almost kidnapped to the Geumwang Group's mansion without knowing it.

Thanks to that, I built a relationship with Soo, and even after several years, we still kept in touch during Chinese New Year or the New Year.

I never imagined that someone known simply as the unfortunate heir of a conglomerate would maintain such a long friendship with me.

Moreover, I received invitations and plane tickets to weddings held in both New York and China.

-Hyun, you are already my dear friend. Regardless of age and nationality, you are the only friend I've shared my heart with for so long, so I would be truly grateful if you could attend my wedding.

Soo even contacted me personally.

What is Geumwang Group? It is a huge corporation renowned not just in China but globally.

Furthermore, considering the expanding Chinese market, any global tycoon would want to establish a connection with Geumwang Group.

Being invited to the wedding of the eldest son of Geumwang Group, and having Soo personally request my attendance, means there's no need to discuss the potential for Dongju Chemical's entry into China. At that moment.

The doorbell of the studio rang. Was it a paparazzo? No way, the security was tight because Im Hyera had invested a lot of money in securing the studio.

In fact, there had been prior contact from Geumwang Group that they would send someone directly. When I opened the door, a familiar face appeared.

"Wang Chun?"

It was Wang Chun, the driver from Geumwang Group who had once kidnapped me at the UK airport.

* * *

A few years ago, Wang Chun was a newcomer who had just joined Geumwang Group.

But now, he was the exclusive driver for Soo, who was known as the de facto successor of Geumwang Group.

When I first came to the UK for a business trip several years ago, I never imagined this would happen.

Glancing.

Wang Chun looked at Kang Hyun's face through the rearview mirror and reminisced about that time.

He had been ordered to pick up the young master at the airport, but unexpectedly, he picked up a completely different person. Just thinking about it still made his spine tingle.

It wasn't a simple mishap. If he had been fired on the spot, there would have been no way to explain it.

If he had been fired right there, he would never have been able to face his parents, who had held a neighborhood feast, slaughtering a pig to celebrate his entry into Geumwang Group.

But as they say, opportunities arise in crises, who would have thought that the young Asian boy he picked up by mistake would become Soo's inseparable best friend?

"Mr. Hyun, is there anything uncomfortable?"

"Not at all. Your driving skills are still exceptional. How is your mother's health?"

"Oh, you remember. Thanks to the treatment she received at Geumwang Group's hospital, my mother is much better now. She's healthy enough to tend to a small garden."

Wang Chun found Kang Hyun, sitting in the back seat, truly mysterious. He was fluent in Cantonese as if he had lived in China for a long time. Moreover, he still remembered the condition of Wang Chun's mother, which he had mentioned in passing years ago.

"Is Mr. Soo doing well?"

"He's extremely busy with business expansion and the wedding, but he's healthier than ever. Sometimes he talks about you, Mr. Hyun. He says if I hadn't picked you up by mistake back then, we wouldn't have built such a deep bond."

The eldest son of Geumwang Group even rejected the successor position because he didn't like meeting people.

But after meeting Kang Hyun in the UK, he completely changed. Of course, in a good way.

Thanks to that, Geumwang Group was experiencing a second golden age in China.

"I dare say, Mr. Hyun, that thanks to you, the young master has changed a lot. Because of that, Geumwang Group can maintain its position as one of the top companies in China."

"No, it's because Mr. Soo is inherently an outstanding individual."

As Soo's exclusive driver, Wang Chun had heard countless stories about Kang Hyun.

Each story of Kang Hyun was incredibly fascinating, highlighting his genius musical talent.

On top of that, he was so humble, making it hard not to like him.

* * *

With Wang Chun's help, Kang Hyun donned a prepared suit at a famous tailor shop in New York.

The wedding held at the grand mansion in the suburbs of New York showcased magnificence from the entrance.

With numerous security personnel and a line of luxury cars, each as expensive as a decent mansion.

"Warren Buffett?"

It felt like all the notable personalities from America, including the investment emperor known as the Oracle of Omaha, had gathered. In the past, these were people I couldn't even dream of meeting, only seeing them on TV or in newspapers.

Even before the wedding started, people were busy greeting each other, showing off their connections.

No matter how much I looked around, it was hard to find another young-looking Asian person like me. Then.

"Hyun!"

Soo, whom I hadn't seen in a long time, came out to greet me in a tuxedo. It was clear that most people at the wedding wanted to greet Soo, but the first guest he greeted was none other than me.

"It's been a long time. I always get your concert videos on DVD. I heard you created a huge sensation in Hollywood again. Your musical talent is truly a gift from heaven. Oh, this is my sister, Huai. Please say hello, she's also a big fan of yours."

Kang Hyun greeted Soo's sister, Huai.

She looked much younger and more sophisticated than in the news I had seen in the past, a typical Chinese beauty. She resembled Fan Bingbing, who later became very popular.

Moreover, in my past life, she was the de facto successor of Geumwang Group, known as one of the most beautiful CEOs in the world.

"Mr. Hyun, it's a pleasure to meet you. Soo speaks so highly of you that I became a big fan as well. By the way, you didn't come with your fiancée today? I heard you have a girlfriend in New York?"

'I can't say my fiancée is a high school student attending school,' thought Kang Hyun, responding with a thin smile. Seeing this, Huai narrowed her eyes, showing a look of intrigue.

Kang Hyun greeted Huai and quickly moved away. Fortunately, Soo also seemed too busy greeting many people to feel regretful about parting with Kang Hyun.

'So flashy.'

True to the Chinese wedding style, the place was a spectacle of gold and red. If not for being told it was New York, one could easily mistake it for a mansion in Beijing.

Though some famous guests occasionally glanced at Kang Hyun, he paid no mind.

It was probably due to the rumors spread on Wall Street that interest had heightened. While moving towards the wine.

"Hyung-ah―!"

An awkward Korean phrase pierced his ears.

"Huh?"

Turning his head, he saw a familiar face. It was the Chinese kid who once followed him around like the Pied Piper.

Kang Hyun, doubting his eyes, asked the person.

"Deng Weiping?"
