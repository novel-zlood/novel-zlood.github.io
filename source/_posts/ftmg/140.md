"Moscow?"

Isn't that an amazing story?

"They say Kang Hyun gave lectures to undergraduates and professors at the Moscow Conservatory. The response was tremendous. In Moscow, they even referred to the violinist Hyun as the 'reincarnation of Tchaikovsky.'"

The elderly professors at Juilliard School of Music simultaneously gasped.

Where is the Moscow Conservatory? It is the pride of the Russians, colder than the north wind of Siberia, and known for its ruthless standards towards outsiders.

Moreover, everyone knew what Tchaikovsky meant to them.

"Especially, the head of the Moscow Conservatory, Alexei, greatly admired and liked the violinist Hyun. It was so unprecedented that the faculty, led by Professor Anton, even suggested officially hiring the violinist Hyun as a professor."

"An official professor?"

"Yes, particularly the comment left by Professor Anton was astounding. When the undergraduates repeatedly requested another lecture from the violinist Hyun, he said, 'It would be a sin for such a brilliant musician to teach future generations in the classroom. In the past, musicians taught because of hunger. There's even a saying that if Mozart had reduced the time he spent teaching aristocrats, the history of music would have advanced a step further.'"

Rumors tend to be exaggerated. Especially when a nickname like 'Little Ghost' changes to 'the reincarnation of Tchaikovsky.'

However, the statements from Alexei and Anton were true.

The remarks from the Russian maestro Alexei and the outstanding Professor Anton were enough to sway the hearts of the elderly professors at Juilliard School of Music.

"As the head of the string department, I can tell you I couldn't sleep properly for several nights after watching the movie about Paganini. Others must have felt the same way as me. His violin was as captivating and dangerous as if Paganini's melody had come back to life. Isn't that right, Carl?"

"Yes, indeed, Professor Oliver."

"Even Carl, who is stingy with praise and quite fastidious, recognized it. So, there's no need to say more about how exceptional his melody was. Honestly, I think we should give the violinist Hyun a chance to lecture at Juilliard. Even the closed and prideful Moscow opened its doors to him."

The elderly professors, who had thought it was just a simple music movie, felt their hearts race at the private screening. They genuinely wanted to hear his melody and meet him.

When Oliver heard his performance at a Hollywood party, it felt like his heart stopped.

However, there was a problem.

"Professor, but won't the director oppose it?"

Setting aside musical perspectives, the violinist Hyun's age made the idea unappealing.

Juilliard's music director, Joseph, had said it.

As his name suggests, the German-born musician was a stubborn person who wouldn't make any judgment unless he saw and heard it himself.

"Our director will change his mind once he meets the violinist Hyun in person. He won't dismiss the rumors as mere exaggerations anymore."

Michelle could hardly believe what she was seeing. It was, after all, the first time she had seen Son Yooha so excited.

Who was she? The one with the always cold expression like an ice princess.

"Oppa!"

At that moment, Son Yooha almost seemed to tumble down the stairs as she ran and hugged a man.

Her excited voice was so ticklish to the ears that passing students turned to look.

The man gently patted Son Yooha's head, as if he was used to it.

Oh my.

The scene was like a movie, and Michelle covered her mouth with her hand.

Only then did the man's figure become clear in Michelle's eyes.

He wasn't very tall, but his facial features were exceptionally beautiful, resembling an Asian man.

With deep eyes and a sharp nose under his wind-blown hair, he looked like a painting.

"Yooha, I’ll be off now. Have a great time!"

After being introduced to Kang Hyun by Son Yooha, Michelle wisely stepped aside.

Though she was only two years older than Son Yooha, her every action was elegant, exuding an indescribable aura.

"Oppa, do you want to tour our school?"

"School?"

"Yes, we can get a visitor's pass from the security guard and have a look around!"

Son Yooha was as excited as a child visiting an amusement park for the first time.

Her eyes, which usually resembled a haughty cat, had turned into those of a gentle puppy.

As they roamed around the school, Hyun felt the students' glances.

"Yooha, are you famous at school?"

"Why?"

"No, it just seems like all the students know you."

Of course, they would know her. Son Yooha was the queen bee even at the prestigious Phillips School.

Moreover, she had been so cold to all the boys who approached her that there were rumors about her sexual orientation.

But looking at her now, she was unmistakably a teenage girl in love, which must have been surprising from their viewpoint.

"Oppa, how long will you stay in New York?"

"Not very long."

Son Yooha hesitated and eventually asked if they could watch a movie together.

To Kang Hyun, Son Yooha seemed utterly lovely and adorable.

What was the problem with watching a movie?

On the other hand, seeing Son Yooha so excited made Kang Hyun want to create new memories for her.

"Yooha, you can't come to Korea during the holidays anymore, right?"

"Yes."

"We won't see each other often, so I should play something for you to remember, so you don't forget me."

Kang Hyun knew why Son Yooha couldn't come to Korea during the holidays.

She was the heir to the Daeil Group. She had to focus intensely on her studies for succession, including learning the art of ruling, to the point of shedding blood and sweat. If she showed even a slight lapse, her cousins would pounce on the opportunity like hyenas.

"This is the music room, and I've got permission to use it, but there's no violin right now."

Son Yooha's tone turned gloomy. Of all days, all the practice violins had been sent out for repairs.

Kang Hyun looked around the music room, which was as good as any practice room in a music college. If it weren't for Son Yooha, he wouldn't have even dreamed of visiting Phillips.

At that moment, he spotted a piano in the corner.

"That will do."

"A piano?"

Kang Hyun sat on the piano bench and skillfully removed the cover. It was a perfectly tuned white piano.

He looked at Son Yooha, who was standing idly, and patted the bench next to him, signaling her to sit down.

"I composed this piece thinking of you, Yooha."

Although Son Yooha had learned social music from a young age, she wasn't adept enough to follow along without sheet music.

Knowing this, Kang Hyun first placed his long fingers on the keys. Then, he took Yooha's left hand with his right hand and placed it over his left hand.

Son Yooha's eyes widened, and her cheeks turned bright red from the sudden contact.

In the end, her white fingers rested on his long fingers on the black and white keys.

As if she were being held, her hand was entirely enveloped by his.

"Paganini."

It seemed it was indeed popular. The theater was packed with people who had come to watch the movie "Paganini."

Spending a peaceful holiday like this was nice. He needed time until the definite victory news from Barbara Mining came through.

"Oppa, let's have caramel popcorn too!"

Son Yooha was already excited. If he had known, he would have taken her to more places in Korea too.

At that moment, a huge poster with Alessandro's face caught his eye.

The word-of-mouth must have been great, as the poster was several times larger than those of blockbuster films released at the same time.

"I heard an Asian boy played the violin solo in the movie. He's an unknown violinist."

"No, I heard he's a genius. He's already famous in the classical music world. What was his name again?"

"Hyun?"

At that moment, he overheard the conversations of moviegoers.

He couldn't help but feel his face flush.

On the other hand, Son Yooha looked delighted.

She seemed to take pride in it, as if boasting that the person they were talking about was the man she was holding arms with.

"Wow."

The movie was fantastic, just as it had been at the private screening.

Especially during the violin solos by Paganini in the movie, the audience in the theater stopped eating their popcorn and focused on the melody in silence.

However, what caught his eye was Alessandro's calluses. It showed how much effort he had put in.

Then,

'Tch.'

The audience member next to him kept muttering to himself. Occasionally, he even shot a disagreeable look at the movie’s Paganini.

How could he ignore the noise pollution?

Even in the U.S., where movie culture had long been established, there were always people without etiquette.

He wanted to say something, but he couldn't ruin the moment when everyone was engrossed in the melody.

* * *

"Paganini!"

Joseph, the director of Juilliard, clicked his tongue at the movie poster.

The professors who had seen the movie wouldn't stop raving about it.

Moreover, the professors who had heard the boy's performance at a party were all saying absurd things.

They claimed it felt like Paganini had come back to life.

Clearly, their ears, soaked in champagne, had exaggerated the melody.

'Violinist Hyun.'

Joseph was already familiar with the name. He was the one who caused a sensation in the classical world a few years ago. There were even rumors that Mozart had reincarnated.

But Joseph didn't believe anything unless he saw and heard it himself. Rumors were always exaggerated.

Even so, he had come to see the movie because of a slight doubt.

"Professor Oliver recommended him so highly, ahem."

The head of the department had praised him endlessly.

Not only that, but even the professors who were usually stingy with praise were noisily talking about violinist Hyun, which naturally piqued his interest.

Let's see how good he really is. With this mindset, Joseph entered the movie theater.

Crunch.

However, as the movie progressed, Joseph's wrinkled hands clenched hard. His reaction was the same as the other professors.

He might have been even more amazed, as his major was also the violin.

His eyes and ears were already captured by the melody beyond the screen, and he found himself unconsciously humming along to Paganini's themes.

He felt the eyes of the boy sitting next to him, but what could he do? Normally, Joseph would have maintained his dignity, but not this time. It felt like someone had poured cold water over his head.

As Paganini's melody continued, and his bowing repeated, Joseph's heart pounded for the unseen performer.

Even after the movie ended, no one moved. Everyone was still lost in the deep afterglow.

At that moment,

"Pen!"

As soon as the movie ended, Joseph hurriedly took out a pen and an empty score from his bag.

The last piece was said to be arranged by the violinist Hyun, based on Paganini's work.

Though it was an arrangement, it was a vast recreation that made many musicians doubt their ears.

Joseph started to jot down notes, recalling the melody he had just heard.

The reason was simple. He wanted to hear that piece again.

As he drew the notes without hesitation, he suddenly paused. Although he had written the score, something felt off. It felt like he had made a mistake.

Furrowing his brows and straining his nerves, he couldn't recall the melody any further. Of course, relying solely on memory to write this much was remarkable.

While Joseph was intensely staring at the score,

"This part is wrong."

The boy sitting next to him pointed to a part of the score with his finger.
