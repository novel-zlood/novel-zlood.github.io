- What do you think of Kang Hyun as a musician, Mr. Cellist Tommy?

An interview with an undergraduate student from the Royal Academy of Music continued. It provided a glimpse of how Kang Hyun is viewed not by the general public but by fellow musicians.

However, even the freckle-faced boy harbored admiration for Kang Hyun, just like the general public.

"Our Hyun is getting good reviews."

"Of course, our grandson-in-law is not someone to be faulted anywhere."

Chairman Yoo and Chairman Wang were watching the documentary together and conversing. 

Normally, the grandfathers wouldn't fully watch a documentary, but maybe it was because Kang Hyun appeared, or perhaps the content was genuinely interesting. They couldn't take their eyes off the screen even for a moment.

"By the way, our grandson-in-law is quite popular in England, isn't he?"

Chairman Wang's voice revealed discomfort. It was understandable since the schoolgirls on the screen were all sending meaningful glances toward Kang Hyun. Of course, perhaps due to the filming cameras, none of the girls dared to approach him.

"Are you worried?"

"There's no way I'd be worried. Compared to our Yooha, they're all mediocre."

"I agree with you. It's hard to believe Yooha is your bloodline, given how outstanding she is."

"You old geezer, you're one to talk."

Kang Hyun's parents smiled warmly as they watched the two grandfathers. When they conversed, they reverted to being mischievous children.

Kang Hyun's mother, Mrs. Yoo Hyun-ja, handed the grandfathers some peeled fruits and said, "Fathers, please have some while you watch."

She was concerned that the elderly grandfathers might have a drop in their blood sugar. The grandfathers, understanding her concern, accepted the forks with the fruit without any complaints. Then it happened.

- There's a video of Kang Hyun performing as a trio?

A voice mentioned that there was a video of a performance from a concert at the Royal Academy of Music.

As the voice of the PD in the documentary grew excited, the first part of Documentary 7 ended.

At the same time, viewers let out a sigh of disappointment. To end it on such a cliffhanger.

But the preview that followed made the viewers sit up again.

"Amazing―!"

PD Kim Da-hyun cheered so loudly it seemed like the broadcasting station might collapse. This was because it recorded record-breaking viewership ratings in the history of Documentary 7.

Particularly, the moment when Kang Hyun played the violin had a staggering viewership of 25%.

In the history of K Broadcasting Station's current affairs and educational programs, there had never been such high ratings.

As proof, despite the late hour, inquiries were already flooding into the broadcasting station.

"Distinguished guests seated in the hall."

A man in a dark suit with mysterious green eyes spoke. His voice drew the attention of everyone in the banquet hall.

"We will now begin the charity auction, the highlight of the Gramophone Music Concert. Please follow the manager's guidance to the auction location. Many rare items are up for auction today, so I hope you enjoy your shopping. The amount you spend will greatly help children with rare diseases."

Dante, the representative and chief editor of Gramophone, smiled faintly.

Tommy swallowed hard. There were three devils in Gramophone. The foremost critic and reviewer was none other than chief editor Dante.

Some referred to him as having the ears of a god. It was well known that many composers wanted him to hear their music.

"The first item is the famous painting 'Days of a Thousand Years' donated by Gregory's CEO Jameson. It was completed around 1890 by French painter Raphael Poussin, known for its abstract style and surrealistic dimensionality. It's said that Pablo Picasso's cubism was inspired by him."

This was no ordinary charity auction.

Famous artworks, well-known antiques, and even shares of Central Park's co-op board that money alone couldn't buy were up for auction.

The items were worth tens of thousands of dollars each.

"Adam, in such an event, you told me to bring just anything?"

If he had brought an ordinary item for auction, it would have been a disgrace.

Kang Hyun was astonished as he looked at the items up for charity auction.

As someone who had attended numerous auctions under the direction of Im Hyera, he couldn't be unaware of the value of these items. Though it was called a charity auction, the prices were comparable to those at Sotheby's in Hong Kong.

"Hyun, no matter what anyone says, today's highlight is your sheet music."

Adam smiled reassuringly. Finally, the much-anticipated auction item was presented.

"A very rare auction item has been presented. It is arguably the most unique item in the history of Gramophone's charity auctions. It is sheet music by the violinist Hyun. However, it is not for a violin piece but a piano piece. Moreover, Kang Hyun has set a condition. The piece will not be released to the world until a pianist who satisfies the composer's standard is found."

Although it was a rather demanding condition, as Adam mentioned, no one seemed incapable of meeting it.

This implied that the attendees were all extraordinary individuals.

Especially those in the classical music industry were eyeing the item like they had discovered a gold mine. At that moment,

"Before we begin the auction, as the representative of Gramophone, I have a request for the violinist Hyun."

All eyes turned to Kang Hyun. Dante, still gazing at Kang Hyun, continued.

"Would it be possible for you to play the original piece here?"

As soon as Dante finished speaking, a piano was being set up on the auction stage.

Everyone else also looked extremely curious. After all, it was difficult to fully understand the melody just by looking at the sheet music.

Kang Hyun nodded briefly and walked over without hesitation.

"Honey, what do you think?"

Im Hyera asked her husband, Son Il-seon, who was watching Documentary 7 with her.

"Even just the brief appearance on the broadcast is so captivating that it feels like a waste for him to solely focus on music. That must be why Father likes him so much."

Son Il-seon, ever the businessman, succinctly evaluated Kang Hyun's worth.

It was just a one-hour broadcast. But the content was so engaging that time seemed to fly by.

Even though it simply followed Kang Hyun's every move, it was enough to make him a fascinating subject for the viewers.

"Don't you find him appealing?"

"How could I not? He's definitely an impressive talent."

"What if our Yooha and Hyun were to get married?"

Son Il-seon momentarily hesitated, pursing his lips. Despite being the second-in-command of Jeil Group, overseeing numerous employees, he was just a father in this situation. However,

"Ahem, if they like each other, how could I stop them?"

Normally, Son Il-seon would have firmly said no, but today was different.

It wasn't just because of the exciting documentary. He was already aware that while he was imprisoned, Kang Hyun, along with Teacher Deok-su, had helped his father in many ways.

If not for Teacher Deok-su, it would have been much harder to thwart Son Kang-wook's ambitions.

Unbeknownst to him, he had already incurred a great debt to Kang Hyun.

"I would love to have grandchildren. If I have a talented grandchild like Hyun, I would give them everything as a grandmother. Hohoho."

Im Hyera, drinking kimchi soup, was already imagining herself as a grandmother.

Watching her, Son Il-seon finally shook his head and got up. How much time had passed since the broadcast ended?

Oh?

Im Hyera snapped out of it when her phone rang. Seeing "International Call" on the display of her phone, she was intrigued.

Not many people knew her direct number. As her curiosity grew, the voice on the other end of the line made her smile.

-Miss Im, it's Cameron!

It was James Cameron, the father of countless masterpieces and a legendary director in Hollywood.

As Kang Hyun sat on the piano bench, the charity auction hall turned into a concert hall.

If the word "charisma" could be personified, it would look like this. The audience held their breath at the sight of Kang Hyun.

As his long fingers touched the keys,

Duuung―!

Just like ripples on a calm lake, the hearts of the audience began to stir.

His long fingers moved smoothly across the keys as if they were dancing. The fingertips pressed the keys elastically, like springs.

From his shoulders, through his elbows, down to his fingers, Kang Hyun's playing flowed like water, making the audience lean forward.

At that moment,

Du-du-du-duung―!

The melody struck like a thunderbolt.

The pace of the piece was accelerating.

The calmness that portrayed the greenness of spring now shone down on the audience like a scorching sun.

Kang Hyun's shoulders moved like waves. His long fingers dancing on the keys mesmerized the musicians present.

The melody changed again, like the gusting winds of autumn.

The fingers that had been moving flamboyantly now moved slowly.

Lively and light leggiero, powerful and agile marcato, or perhaps rapid staccato single notes, various piano techniques came to mind.

The sheet music required a variety of techniques that were hard to single out. Like reeds that bend but never break, it boasted flexibility.

Lastly,

Duuung―

Like walking on freshly fallen snow, each time his long fingers pressed the keys, deep footprints were engraved in the hearts of the audience.

Each note left an indelible impression on their minds.

Even after the performance ended, no one in the audience spoke. That included Dante, who was hosting the charity auction.

Everyone was lost in thought, as if they were intoxicated by the moment.

How much time passed? Someone, as if spellbound, shouted as Kang Hyun stood up from the piano bench.

"One million dollars―!"

It was the call to start the auction.
