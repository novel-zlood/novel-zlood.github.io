Bzzz.

It was an unfamiliar melody. Dmitri, the concertmaster of the London Symphony, perked up his ears and cautiously opened the door to the concert hall.

It was late at night. There was no reason for staff or members to be still present. Moreover, wasn't it a day without rehearsal?

He himself wouldn't have visited the concert hall at this late hour if not for the sheet music he had left behind.

But.

It was a refined and rich melody. Even without accompaniment, it filled the stage without a gap.

It felt like a gentle wave soothing his ears, but suddenly the tone changed roughly like a rising tide.

The concert hall was dark as if covered by blackout curtains, with only the moonlight filtering through the long curtains faintly illuminating the stage.

It was an amazing technique.

The hand holding the bow was bowing without hesitation. The string reflected in the moonlight was emitting a subtle glow.

Dmitri, the concertmaster, became an audience member, captivated by the melody without even thinking to identify the presence on stage.

How much time had passed?

When the bow and string finally parted as if the fleeting time had wished to be eternal, Dmitri was overwhelmed with lingering feelings and regret.

As a violinist, he wanted to appreciate such an enchanting melody a bit longer. It was then.

Who on earth?

"Who is it?"

Only then did the situation start to make sense. An unidentified figure was playing alone on the concert hall stage at a late hour. Naturally, it was a restricted area except for authorized personnel.

James, Samuel, John, Drake, Mika...

The names of numerous members in the violin section flashed through his mind.

But he soon shook his head. He couldn't find a violinist who could match the performance he had just seen.

Isn't it an exaggerated statement? Dmitri, the concertmaster, wanted to believe so.

The London Symphony members were so skilled that there was a saying that their noble musical confidence was proportional to their ability. But if asked whether there was a violinist who could replicate the performance he had just witnessed, he could confidently answer 'impossible.'

That was how much the unidentified violinist had captivated Dmitri's heart.

It was then.

Thud.

With the sound of footsteps, the unidentified violinist descended from the stage.

The long curtains swayed as if the moonlight was chasing his retreating figure. Dmitri approached the figure, his eyes glistening.

It was only after Dmitri grabbed his shoulder in the dark that he realized. For some reason, the back looked familiar.

"Maestro?"

Wasn't it Spencer, the maestro of the London Symphony!

Kang Hyun opened the window with a towel around his neck. The October wind brushed past his cheeks.

The colorful autumn leaves were pleasing to the eyes, and the birds chirping beautifully delighted his ears. But anyway.

"Vroom."

It sounded like the exhaust noise from a car. Kang Hyun turned his head to look at the freckled boy lying on his bed.

Tommy had already flipped onto his stomach and was in a deep sleep. Tommy had spent almost every night in Kang Hyun's room these past few days.

"Umm, Sabrina... Hyun..."

Occasionally, he would mumble in his sleep, calling out Sabrina and Kang Hyun's names. His freckles and cheeks seemed to dance along as well.

Kang Hyun couldn't even imagine what kind of dream Tommy was having.

Tommy likes you.

At that moment, Sabrina's words popped into Kang Hyun's mind. He suddenly felt a chilling sensation down his spine.

As Kang Hyun was shaking his head to dispel his thoughts, Tommy stretched and woke up.

"Hyun, is it morning already?"

"The sun is high in the sky. Hurry up and wash up. Sabrina must be waiting."

"Oh right, we were supposed to have breakfast with Sabrina!"

At that moment, Tommy, who had been drowsily opening his eyes, jumped out of bed. How is it that he moves so quickly whenever Sabrina's name comes up?

When the two men arrived at the Royal Academy of Music cafeteria, many students were already having their meals.

"You're late today."

"Sorry, Sabrina!"

As Tommy repeatedly apologized with his head down, Sabrina swayed her silver hair as if she understood.

"By the way, why is it so noisy even though it's just students having breakfast?"

At Kang Hyun's question, Tommy, who claimed to be a social butterfly, started asking the students around.

As Tommy listened to the students, his eyes grew larger and larger. Eventually, he seemed to understand the cause of the commotion.

"Unbelievable!"

Tommy spoke in disbelief.

"Maestro Spencer is going to participate in the concert!"

"The maestro?"

"Yes! And the even more surprising thing is that the maestro is challenging the violin section."

"Violin?"

It was an unexpected story. Tommy quickly added.

"The highlight is that the maestro is scheduled right before us!"

"Tommy, don't senior performers usually perform last?"

"Our school's concerts are different. The seniors perform first, and the undergraduates perform afterward. It's strictly a festival for undergraduates."

Only then did Kang Hyun understand the cause of the commotion. Since Spencer, the maestro and pride of the London Symphony, was personally participating in the concert, it was no wonder.

As Kang Hyun nodded, Sabrina, biting into a sandwich, asked.

"It might not happen, but won't our performance be compared to the maestro's? Especially since it's the same string instrument. I thought he would surely play the piano. Hyun, what do you think?"

"What about?"

"Which do you think will be better, the maestro's performance or ours?"

To someone who didn't know, it would seem like an arrogant question. That's how famous Spencer was.

Kang Hyun took a moment to think in silence.

Although the concert wasn't a competition, wouldn't there be an award? According to Tommy, the guest performances were also included in the award selection.

Moreover, no undergraduate had ever won the award at the concert.

Of course, since the seniors who were exceptional talents from the Royal Academy of Music performed directly, it was inevitable.

"The maestro's performance will surely be outstanding."

Instead of answering, Kang Hyun imagined the maestro's violin performance.

* * *

"Tommy, are you nervous?"

Of course!

Tommy nodded so vigorously that it seemed he might shake off his freckles.

The Royal Academy of Music's concert was originally renowned. Naturally, talented undergraduates participated, as well as famous alumni.

However, this year was exceptionally popular beyond comparison.

It was because of Maestro Spencer and Kang Hyun.

As soon as the news of their participation spread across the UK, famous musicians and even nobles donated and took their seats.

Even being watched by professors was nerve-wracking, but the presence of renowned musicians was overwhelming.

Gulp.

It wasn't just Tommy who was nervous. The waiting room was already filled with palpable tension. Other undergraduates who had applied for the concert couldn't easily shake off their nervousness either.

If there were two people who weren't nervous, it would be Kang Hyun and Sabrina.

Kang Hyun's composure was understandable given his extensive experience, including conducting for the British royal family, but Sabrina was unexpected.

Given her reluctance to perform in front of others, there were concerns about stage fright, but surprisingly, she showed no signs of nervousness. Instead, she teased Tommy.

"Tommy, you look like a squirrel that lost its acorn. Are you so scared that you might wet yourself on stage? If I may give some sisterly advice, it's best to visit the restroom in advance."

"N-Noona, what are you talking about? Sabrina, I'm older than you..."

"If you're really an oppa, you should protect your dongsaeng at times like this. Wait, I'll bring some strong tea to help you calm down. Look at Hyun. He's smiling gently like a kind father, not nervous at all."

Despite Sabrina's teasing, Tommy was too overwhelmed to respond.

At that moment, Maestro Spencer appeared on the screen above the stage.

He received a thunderous applause, almost shaking the Royal Academy of Music hall where the concert was being held.

"The maestro really brought out his violin."

Although he half-expected it, Kang Hyun was thrilled to see the maestro's violin performance, which had been rumored but never witnessed in person.

He had seen the maestro coach numerous members as a conductor but never actually saw him perform.

Then, the maestro stepped forward and tapped the microphone.

"The applause is overwhelming. Is it because I've aged? It's surreal to see my old friend, who used to always play pranks on me, sitting as the president of our alma mater. But I was surprised to see my performance slot. I didn't expect to be scheduled so early! Could it be because I spilled wine on the president's pants a few days ago?"

Spencer, usually serious, made a joke to lighten the mood. President Samuel even responded, saying, "Those were my favorite pants," causing laughter to erupt.

Satisfied, Spencer nodded briefly and looked at the audience.

"Today, as a senior and with my connection to the president, I have a request. Before my violin performance, I'd like to see a trio's performance that includes violinist Hyun. President Samuel, may we?"

What was this about? Tommy stood up in surprise at the unexpected request. They weren't even mentally prepared yet, and suddenly their performance order was changed.

However, President Samuel smiled, as if finding it amusing.

"It seems the maestro is playing an interesting prank."

Kang Hyun said, patting Tommy's shoulder. Sabrina also seemed pleased, as if she didn't like waiting. Only Tommy looked glum.

Kang Hyun leaned in and whispered something to Tommy. Tommy's eyes widened, and his nervousness seemed to vanish.

"Sabrina, could you ask the question you did at the cafeteria?"

"What question?"

"The one comparing the maestro's performance to ours."

"Oh!"

Sabrina, recalling, asked.

"Hyun, which do you think will be better, the maestro's performance or ours?"

Looking alternately at Sabrina and a now composed Tommy, Kang Hyun answered without hesitation.
