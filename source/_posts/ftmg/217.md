Bzzt.

A strange melody played. Dmitri, the concertmaster of the London Symphony, pricked up his ears and cautiously opened the door to the concert hall.

It was late at night. It was unlikely that any staff or orchestra members would still be around. Besides, it wasn’t even a rehearsal day.

He wouldn’t have come to the concert hall at this late hour either if he hadn’t left his music score behind.

However,

The melody was refined and rich. Despite the lack of accompaniment, it filled the stage completely.

One moment, it was as soothing as a gently flowing stream, and the next, the tone surged like a rough tidal wave.

The concert hall was dark, as if a blackout curtain had been drawn, with only the moonlight shining faintly through the long curtains onto the stage.

What incredible skill.

The hand holding the bow moved with confidence. The strings, reflecting the moonlight, emitted a subtle glow.

Concertmaster Dmitri, without even thinking to identify who was on stage, became an audience member, completely absorbed in the melody.

How much time had passed?

When the bow and strings finally parted ways, as if wishing the fleeting moment had lasted forever, Dmitri was left overwhelmed and filled with regret.

As a violinist, he wanted to savor that enchanting melody a bit longer. It was then.

Who on earth...

"Who is it?"

Only then did he grasp the situation. A mysterious figure was playing alone on the stage at this late hour. It was, of course, an area restricted to authorized personnel.

James, Samuel, John, Drake, Mika...

The names of numerous violinists in the orchestra flitted through his mind.

But he soon shook his head. He couldn’t find a violinist who matched the performance he had just witnessed.

Exaggerated words? Dmitri wanted to believe so.

The London Symphony members were known for their outstanding skills, so much so that their musical confidence was proportional to their abilities. But if asked whether any of them could replicate the performance he had just seen, he could confidently answer "No."

That was how much the mysterious violinist had captivated Dmitri.

It was then.

Thud.

With the sound of footsteps, the mysterious violinist descended from the stage.

The long curtains swayed, and the moonlight seemed to chase after his retreating figure. Dmitri’s eyes gleamed as he approached the figure.

It wasn’t until Dmitri grabbed the figure’s shoulder in the darkness that he realized why the back seemed familiar.

"Maestro?"

It was none other than Spencer, the maestro of the London Symphony!

Kang Hyun wrapped a towel around his neck and threw open the window. The October breeze brushed past his cheeks.

The colorful autumn leaves were pleasing to the eyes, and birds chirping made delightful sounds. But,

"Rumble."

It sounded like the exhaust noise from a car, didn’t it? Kang Hyun turned his head to look at the freckled boy lying on his bed.

Tommy had flipped onto his stomach and was deeply asleep. For the past few days, Tommy had spent almost every night in Kang Hyun’s room.

"Mmm, Sabrinaaa. Hyeooon..."

From time to time, he would mutter in his sleep, calling out Sabrina and Kang Hyun’s names. His freckles and cheeks seemed to dance along.

What on earth was he dreaming about?

Tommy likes you.

Sabrina’s words suddenly flashed through Kang Hyun’s mind, sending a chill down his spine.

As Kang Hyun shook his head to dispel the thoughts, Tommy stretched and woke up.

"Hyun, is it morning already?"

"The sun is high in the sky. Hurry and wash up. Let’s go to the cafeteria. Sabrina must be waiting."

"Right, we were supposed to have breakfast with Sabrina!"

Instantly, the drowsy-eyed Tommy sprang up. Why did he move so swiftly whenever Sabrina’s name was mentioned?

By the time the two men arrived at the Royal Academy of Music’s cafeteria, many students were already having their meals.

"You're late today?"

"Sorry, Sabrina!"

Tommy bowed his head and repeatedly apologized to Sabrina, who acknowledged with a nod, her silver hair shimmering.

"By the way, why is it so noisy here? I mean, it's not just that there are many students early in the morning."

At Kang Hyun’s question, Tommy, the self-proclaimed social butterfly, asked the surrounding students.

As Tommy heard the story from the students, his eyes grew wider. Eventually, he seemed to grasp the source of the commotion.

"Awesome—!"

Tommy exclaimed in disbelief.

"Maestro Spencer is participating in the concert!"

"The Maestro?"

"Yeah! And the even more amazing part is that the Maestro will be competing in the violin section."

"The violin?"

It was an unexpected revelation. Tommy added more details, not missing a beat.

"The highlight is that the Maestro will be performing just before us!"

"Tommy, don’t the senior guest performers usually play last?"

"Our school's concert is different. Seniors perform first, and then the undergraduates. After all, it's a festival for the undergraduates."

Only then did the cause of the commotion make sense. It was naturally a big deal that Spencer, the pride of the London Symphony and the Maestro himself, would be participating in the concert.

As Kang Hyun nodded in understanding, Sabrina, munching on a sandwich, asked,

"Although it’s unlikely, won’t our performance be compared to the Maestro’s? Especially since he's playing the same string instrument. I thought he would play the piano. Hyun, what do you think?"

"What do you mean?"

"Which do you think will be better, the Maestro’s performance or ours?"

To a stranger, it might have seemed an arrogant question. That was how high Spencer’s reputation was.

Kang Hyun paused, pondering silently.

Although it wasn’t a competition, the concert did award prizes. According to Tommy, guest performances were also considered in the prize selection.

Moreover, no undergraduate had ever won the grand prize at the concert.

Naturally, with the alumni performing, it was inevitable.

"The Maestro’s performance will undoubtedly be outstanding."

Instead of answering, Kang Hyun envisioned the Maestro’s violin performance.

* * *

"Tommy, are you nervous?"

Of course!

Tommy nodded so vigorously it seemed his freckles might fall off.

The Royal Academy of Music’s concert was highly prestigious. Not only did talented undergraduates participate, but famous alumni did as well.

However, this year’s concert was more popular than ever.

It was because of Maestro Spencer and Kang Hyun.

As soon as the news spread that both would be participating, renowned musicians and even aristocrats from all over the UK sponsored the event and secured seats.

Even the professors' scrutiny was nerve-wracking, let alone the presence of renowned musicians.

Gulp.

Tommy wasn’t the only one nervous. The waiting room was thick with tension. Other participating undergraduates also struggled to shake off their anxiety.

There were only two people in the room who didn’t seem nervous.

Kang Hyun and Sabrina.

Kang Hyun’s calmness was understandable, given his extensive experience, including conducting for the British Royal Family. Sabrina, however, was a surprise.

Despite her aversion to performing in front of others and the concern that she might have stage fright, she showed no signs of nervousness. She even teased Tommy.

"Tommy, you look like a squirrel that lost its acorn. Are you going to wet yourself on stage? As your unnie, my advice is to visit the bathroom beforehand."

"No, noona. Sabrina, I’m older than you..."

"If you’re an oppa, you should protect your dongsaeng at times like this. Wait, I’ll get you some strong black tea to calm your nerves. Look at Hyun. He’s smiling kindly like a father."

Despite Sabrina’s teasing, Tommy had no energy left to retort.

Just then, Maestro Spencer appeared on the screen above the stage.

He was greeted with a storm of applause. It was as if the concert hall at the Royal Academy of Music would burst.

"Maestro really brought out his violin."

Kang Hyun, though he had hoped, was thrilled to see Maestro’s violin performance live.

He had only ever seen the Maestro coach countless orchestra members as a conductor, never actually play.

At that moment, the Maestro stepped forward and tapped the microphone.

"The applause is overwhelming. Maybe it’s because I’m getting old. A friend who used to play pranks on me is now the president of our alma mater; it’s hard to believe. But I was surprised by my performance order. I didn’t expect to go this early! I spilled wine on the president’s pants a few days ago. Could it be because of that?"

In an uncharacteristic move, the Maestro lightened the mood with a joke. Samuel, the president, even responded, "Those were my favorite pants," prompting laughter from the audience.

Spencer nodded in satisfaction and looked around.

"Today, as your senior and a friend of the president, I’d like to ask a favor. Before I perform, I’d like to see a trio performance featuring violinist Hyun. President Samuel, may I?"

What was this? Tommy jumped up at the sound from the screen. How could they change the performance order without notice?

But President Samuel smiled as if amused.

"Looks like the Maestro wants to play a fun prank."

Kang Hyun said, patting Tommy’s shoulder. Sabrina seemed pleased, as if she was tired of waiting. Only Tommy looked distressed.

Then Kang Hyun whispered something into Tommy’s ear, which made Tommy’s eyes widen and his tension vanish.

"Sabrina, can you ask me the question you asked at the cafeteria again?"

"What question?"

"The one where you compared the Maestro’s performance with ours."

"Oh!"

Sabrina, recalling, asked,

"Hyun, which do you think will be better, the Maestro’s performance or ours?"

Looking between Sabrina and the now composed Tommy, Kang Hyun answered without hesitation.

"Ours!"
