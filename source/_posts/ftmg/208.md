“Leave of absence?”

The assistant at the department office asked back, seemingly puzzled.

“Yes, sir. I’d like to apply for a leave of absence.”

“But wait a minute. Kang Hyun, I heard from the professors that your midterm grades were quite good, so why are you suddenly taking a leave?”

“Well, it just turned out that way.”

The assistant still looked like he didn’t understand.

It’s understandable because Kang Hyun had not only topped the department in the first semester but also demonstrated outstanding skills in the midterms of this semester. If he continued like this, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to be the top student of the department for the first year. Moreover, it wasn’t even the end of the semester.

“Why don’t you think about it again? In a few months, it’ll be winter break, and taking a leave now seems like a waste, doesn’t it? If it’s because of your public performances or broadcasting activities, the professors might be able to allow some flexibility with your attendance.”

“I think I need to go abroad, so it will be difficult to attend classes regularly.”

“Abroad?”

The assistant’s face was full of regret. It wasn’t just the assistant. Even the head of the German Language Department and the professors were dissuading him from taking a leave of absence.

Among them, the one who opposed the most was none other than Professor Jung from the Law Department.

“A sudden leave of absence?!”

“I’m planning to work as a violinist abroad. Even though it’s for a short time, I enjoyed learning law from you, Professor. I’m really sorry for missing the recent quiz.”

“No, you could have easily passed my quizzes even with your eyes closed. But suddenly taking a leave? I didn’t even expect you to change your major, but taking a leave? Why not consider being an exchange student instead?”

“I thought about it, but there’s no university I particularly want to go to.”

Well, he had considered being an exchange student.

But the subjects he could learn at a university in London were only in the same language and business fields.

For someone who decided to be a violinist, language and business subjects were no longer helpful. It was then.

“How about the Royal Academy of Music?”

“Professor, with all due respect, the Royal Academy of Music doesn’t accept exchange students. Besides, I’m not a music student but a language student.”

“That’s a matter for regular undergraduates. You have unique social standing and experience. The Royal Academy of Music is known for its high entry standards, but it might work out. I’ll talk to the president separately. It’s a pity for you to stop your studies like this. It’s not because of your talent in law, but because of you as a person.”

I never expected Professor Jung to think so highly of me. After all, to him, I was just another passing undergraduate.

Although I had taken his class in my past life, I hadn’t built such a bond. I even remember disliking him because he was known for giving tough grades.

At that moment, Professor Jung patted my shoulder and said,

“You’ll do well wherever you go.”

No matter how I think about it, I’ve had incredible luck with people in this life.

A subtle scent of ink wafted in the air.

“Delicious.”

It was a famous tea made by renowned tea masters in China. It was so expensive that a few grams could cost millions of won, but it wasn’t something just anyone could obtain.

Chairman Wang wetted his dry lips with the fine tea, waiting for his guest.

“Grandfather, have you been waiting long?”

Finally, the long-awaited guest arrived.

Chairman Wang, known for his lack of facial expressions, couldn’t help but smile.

Kang Hyun sat opposite Chairman Wang as if he were meeting his own grandfather.

“You’re going to study abroad?”

“Yes, it seems I’ll be living in London. I’m planning to return to music. I’ve been away from the violin for too long.”

“I trust you’ll prepare well, but is there anything you’d like to ask of your grandfather?”

“A request, huh? While I’m away, please stay healthy and spend a lot of time talking with my grandfather.”

Chairman Wang found him admirable. He thought Kang Hyun was very mature for his age.

After all, their first meeting had been extraordinary. Not only did he possess deep insight, but he also predicted the financial crisis.

Chairman Wang had met numerous talents, but he had never seen a unique genius like Kang Hyun.

Moreover, he even seemed to hide his abilities as if he didn’t want to reveal them.

“Aren’t you curious about how Daeil Group is doing?”

“If I say I’m curious, will you tell me everything?”

“Why not. You’ve helped me a lot.”

“Actually, I’m more curious about the relationship between you and Mr. Deoksoo than about Daeil Group…”

Chairman Wang chuckled. Of course, someone like Kang Hyun would already have a clear picture of Daeil Group’s situation.

“My first meeting with my teacher was when I first came down to Seoul from Hamgyeongbuk-do. It was right after the war, and Seoul was almost in ruins. I thought I had been through everything in Hamgyeongbuk-do, but I was swindled several times in Seoul. I met my teacher when I was almost penniless. Even then, he looked like a strange man.”

The first meeting between Chairman Wang and Teacher Deoksoo was extraordinary. Teacher Deoksoo spoke to Chairman Wang as if he had seen his future.

“My teacher boisterously told me he would help me build a foundation if I had the guts to take over South Korea. Naturally, I said I did. At first, I thought he was joking, dressed like a shabby sage, but he really taught me many things. Especially during the military regime, I benefited greatly from his teachings.”

“What kind of benefits did you receive?”

“Let's see, I can’t tell you for free. Promise me something, and I’ll tell you.”

What promise was he talking about? Chairman Wang leaned forward and looked at Kang Hyun.

His experienced eyes seemed to be reading Kang Hyun's inner thoughts.

Chairman Wang took a sip of tea and spoke quietly.

“Take over Daeil Group in the future.”

“Teacher, it’s truly an honor!”

The journalist from the domestic music magazine stood up abruptly. His face was full of excitement.

After all, it was an interview with the world-renowned maestro, Empress Karas. Interviewing Empress Karas in person felt like a dream.

“No, I don’t know how to thank you for this warm welcome. By the way, your German is very fluent.”

“I studied in Munich during my college years. I spent my school days listening to your albums. I never thought you would agree to this interview. May I ask about the reason for your sudden visit to Korea?”

“Of course. I’m returning to the stage in London, and I came to Korea to personally give the ticket to Hyun.”

“By Hyun, do you mean the violinist Hyun?”

Karas nodded with a gentle smile.

“There are rumors that violinist Hyun is your disciple. The classical music scene in Korea has been quite stirred by those rumors.”

“A disciple? Not at all.”

“You mean he’s not your disciple?”

“Our relationship is so special that it cannot be described with words like teacher and disciple. In a way, he could be a friend, or we have a musical connection. I was able to take up the baton again thanks to Hyun.”

The journalist’s pen moved busily. Every word she said was a scoop.

“The fact that you became a guest conductor of the London Symphony is already widely known. Did violinist Hyun have a part in your decision to choose the London Symphony?”

“Of course. His music will be completed with the London Symphony. And I’m looking forward to the day I can listen to Hyun’s music as an audience member.”

“As an audience member?”

“Many people are amazed by Hyun’s musical talent. But I think he’s still in the budding stage. The musical world of Hyun we’re seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg. When his vast musical world fully unfolds, we will finally hear the true melody of Hyun.”

It was more than praise; it was glowing admiration. Had any Korean musician ever received such shining praise from a world-class maestro?

The journalist felt his heart pounding. He quickly turned the pages of his notebook.

There was still a lot of time left for the interview, but he had so many questions that his mind was racing.

“Let’s drink and die!”

Kim Daewoo cheerfully raised his beer mug. Thanks to Kim Daewoo, the class president and self-proclaimed social butterfly, all the students from the German Language Department had gathered for the farewell party.

I never imagined so many people would gather because of me. We had even rented out the entire pub.

As the cheers to drink and die went back and forth several times, the atmosphere was ripe, and some students’ faces were already flushed like red persimmons.

At that moment, Kim Daewoo stood up and tapped his beer mug with a spoon.

“Let’s hear a farewell speech from our proud millennial star-to-be, Kang Hyun!”

It was kind of embarrassing, but for some reason, it didn’t feel bad. It felt like, at this moment, I was really 20 years old.

With everyone’s attention focused on me in the pub, I stood up.

I saw friends I had gotten to know while attending school. Thanks to Kim Daewoo, who was a social butterfly, I could become friends with all of them.

“Thank you all for coming because of me. I’m not leaving the school completely, just taking a step towards my dream. I’ll always remember that I’m a 00 student of the German Language Department at Korea University. So then.”

I lifted my beer mug.

“Let’s drink and die today. It’s on me!”

The sound of beer mugs clinking echoed everywhere. It was as beautiful as the ringing of a triangular bell.

I shared drinks with friends I had gotten to know. I can’t count how many times I received drinks from seniors I hadn’t properly greeted before. Since becoming young again, I hadn’t drunk this much.

“Hyun, I’m really envious of you.”

It was when the tipsiness had reached my chin. Kim Daewoo, looking like a bear, was staring at me with bleary eyes.

“What are you envious of?”

“Man, what you said earlier. Taking a step towards your dream. How romantic is that? These days, I’m already under pressure at home. What will I do after graduation? My mom tells me to get a job at a big company, and my dad, maybe because of the financial crisis experience, tells me to consider being a civil servant just in case. My grandpa gets furious, asking how can a Korea University graduate become a civil servant. Honestly, I don’t know what’s right either.”

“Daewoo, just do what you want to do.”

“What I want to do?”

Kim Daewoo brushed his nose bridge and added.

“Actually, I had a dream since I was young. To be a star’s manager!”

“A manager?”

“Yes, a star’s manager. My cousin is a medical student, but he wants to be a soccer team doctor. But I strangely want to be a manager. Supporting a star quietly without receiving the spotlight but diligently assisting the star. It feels like I’m creating a star myself.”

At that moment, I said without thinking.

“Then be my manager later.”

Maybe it was because of the alcohol. I replied casually, but Kim Daewoo asked again if I was serious.

When I said I was serious, Kim Daewoo, who looked like a bear, smiled bashfully and buried his head on the table. Many students had already passed out from drinking.
