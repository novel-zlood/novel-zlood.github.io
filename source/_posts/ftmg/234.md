“Oppa, you're so clumsy.”

Yooha brushed off the sandwich crumbs from the corner of Kang Hyun's mouth.

Her actions were so tender that it felt as if honey was dripping from the Ice Queen's eyes.

With his hat pulled down low, Kang Hyun stared endlessly at Yooha's face.

Although he wanted to throw off the hat, he couldn't help it.

“Do you think anyone will recognize us today?”

“With the hat pulled down like this? I doubt it.”

Kang Hyun felt like a celebrity. He never imagined that even in New York, there would be so many people recognizing him.

One day, while eating crepes with Yooha on the streets of Broadway, so many people recognized him that Yooha almost fell due to the crowd.

If the bodyguards hadn't arrived in time, it could have been a big problem.

“But oppa, if so many people recognize you in New York, won't it be chaos when we go back to Korea?”

“It's because it's New York. People here are sensitive to gossip. It's not as bad in Korea.”

“Hmm? Really?”

Yooha seemed skeptical. It was understandable since Kang Hyun's presence in New York was truly remarkable.

Perhaps because famous Hollywood personalities were interested in him, Kang Hyun's name frequently appeared in well-known New York magazines.

Unexpectedly, he even managed to rank within the top 100 most influential musicians in the world. If he became more famous, paparazzi might follow him.

At that moment.

“Tommy, instead of a sandwich, how about a hamburger?”

Two men were bickering on a bench a little distance away.

The moment Kang Hyun heard the familiar name and looked up, his eyes met with the man called Tommy.

In that instant, Tommy's previously annoyed face changed to one of shock.

Damn!

Kang Hyun realized that the man had recognized his face. He couldn't let his precious date be interrupted like this.

Just as he was about to get up with Yooha.

“Are you the violinist Hyun!?”

Tommy hurriedly ran towards Kang Hyun. Kang Hyun thought of giving an autograph to keep things quiet since he had already been recognized.

“Yes! We are from ABA Broadcasting. If you have a moment, could we talk in a café?”

“I don't do interviews. Sorry, but I'm spending personal time right now. Please contact my agency.”

“W-Wait!”

After some typical exchanges, Kang Hyun turned away.

Even if he seemed cold, he had no choice. He had to be firm with reporters or broadcast people to avoid any lingering issues.

If he left any room for negotiation, they would cling on to him endlessly.

At that moment.

“We want to invite Mr. Hyun as the first guest for a new program we're launching, hosted by Ellen Fox!”

Kang Hyun's steps halted. The Ellen Show was a famous American talk show he enjoyed in his past life.

It was a globally renowned program hosted by the famous comedian Ellen Fox.

Not only was it considered the best talk show since the Oprah Winfrey Show, but it also went on to win numerous Emmys and the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.

*

It would be a lie to say he wasn’t tempted.

“Did you say The Ellen Show?”

Kang Hyun moved to a nearby coffee shop with Tommy, who introduced himself as a producer from ABA Broadcasting.

With his hat pulled down low and the café being almost empty, he didn’t have to worry about other people's gazes.

They had already verified his identity with ABA Broadcasting, so the conversation proceeded smoothly.

“Yes, you know Ellen Fox, right?”

“Of course I know her.”

How could he not? Ellen Fox was the star of American sitcoms and talk shows he enjoyed in his past life.

She was famous even now, but she would become globally renowned in the future.

Not only as a comedian and actress but also as a talented writer, she was highly regarded. Her numerous Emmys and People's Choice Awards proved her popularity.

“But you said the first taping of The Ellen Show is this year?”

“Yes, have you heard about The Ellen Show? It’s a program we're preparing in secret, so very few people know about it. Ah, by now, some journalists should have heard the rumors. The first broadcast will air nationwide in January next year after wrapping up the recording at the end of this year.”

Kang Hyun was puzzled. He retraced his past memories but was unsure if the first broadcast of The Ellen Show was really in 2001.

“Did Ellen Fox agree to this casting? What do the broadcasting executives think? They wouldn’t be too thrilled about having me as the first guest, right?”

It was the year 2000, with the fervor of the millennium still lingering.

Even though the era of racial discrimination was said to be over, remnants still existed.

Moreover, considering the times, the popularity of Asians in mainstream American society wasn’t that high.

The few Asians acting in Hollywood were mostly backed by Chinese capital.

“All the executives agreed. Mr. Hyun’s popularity has already been proven in Europe. I understand your concerns, but compared to Europe, the U.S. is almost free of racial discrimination. The director is also a big fan of yours and agreed unconditionally. If you don't believe me, I can contact him directly here.”

Kang Hyun couldn't grasp the extent of his popularity.

He fully understood his fame in the UK, where the London Symphony Orchestra existed.

He had performed for the British royal family in the past and received high praise from Spencer, known as the heart of the London Symphony.

But America might be a different story.

“Of course, Ellen doesn’t know who the first guest will be yet. She’s probably thinking of a famous Hollywood actor or celebrity. It’s unprecedented for a classical musician to be the first guest on a talk show. I hope you’re not offended by what I’m saying.”

“Of course not. I understand completely.”

He didn’t blame Ellen.

Even if Kang Hyun was the host of a talk show, he wouldn’t invite a classical musician as the first guest, who would determine the show’s success.

Moreover, Kang Hyun was Asian. Having lived abroad for a long time in his past life, he understood their mindset better than anyone.

“But I’m confident I can persuade Ellen.”

Tommy’s expression was resolute, like a general heading to battle.

Kang Hyun also felt tempted. He had the chance to be the first guest on The Ellen Show, which he had enjoyed so much in his past life.

Although his life had been far from fame, this was a different kind of desire. But he had to separate personal and professional matters clearly.

“Alright.”

“Pardon?”

“I’ll positively consider your offer. But.”

Kang Hyun added with a faint smile.

“You’ll need to discuss the appearance fee and other conditions with my agency. I’ll inform them in advance.”

Im Hyera, the director, was undoubtedly the best negotiator Kang Hyun knew. She would surely secure satisfactory conditions.

At that moment, the eyes of Tommy, the ABA Broadcasting producer, lit up as if he had gained the world.

* * *

“Violinist Hyun?”

Ellen couldn’t understand. Inviting a classical musician as the first guest on the show she would host?

At first, she thought producer Tommy was joking.

Although she had no bias against the profession, classical musicians didn't have much impact, did they?

“He’s currently the most popular classical musician.”

“But it’s still classical music, right? And he’s Asian. I don’t dislike Asians, but isn't this supposed to be ABA Broadcasting’s flagship program? This is so different from the usual practices of the broadcasting company. Tommy, did the director really approve this?”

“Ellen, seriously, what era do we live in to talk about racial discrimination?”

“What are you talking about! It’s not about racial discrimination. How can a classical musician, who doesn’t have much impact, be the first guest? Moreover, Americans don’t prefer classical music. I thought you were joking, Tommy!”

The argument between Ellen and Tommy continued.

The broadcasting executives understood Ellen’s concerns.

Even though extreme racial discrimination had disappeared, it was still customary for broadcasting companies not to feature Black or Asian people in pilot programs.

Moreover, how could a violinist attract attention in the U.S., where most people were unfamiliar with classical music?

“Instead of arguing, contact the Hollywood directors.”

“Why Hollywood?”

“They can explain Violinist Hyun more objectively than I can. Ellen, you won’t believe a word I say anyway.”

Ellen didn’t understand Tommy’s point. Why bring up Hollywood now?

But Ellen eventually contacted the Hollywood directors she knew.

-Violinist Hyun? Ellen, are you joking? He’s one of the most famous people in New York right now. Hollywood is in an uproar because of him!

What?

It could have been just one person’s opinion.

But.

-I know Hyun well. He composed the music for my next project. I discovered more of his hidden charms at a garden party recently. If I had a daughter, I would have matched them without hesitation!

Even Jim Filmer, known for being picky in Hollywood, was praising Hyun.

Ellen didn’t stop there. She contacted James Cameron, known as the father of masterpieces.

-Ellen, I don’t know if I can judge Hyun. I don’t know what answer you’re expecting from me, but if I were you, I would invite Hyun as the first guest over anyone else. I’m desperate to have him in my movie, not just your show!

It was unbelievable. She never imagined hearing such a response from James Cameron.

Indeed, one of the top directors in Hollywood was desperately wanting Hyun, who wasn’t even a famous actor.

Ellen continued to call the famous people she knew.

Not just Hollywood directors but also famous journalists and celebrities from the U.S. and Europe.

The more calls she made, the simpler the conclusion became. Violinist Hyun was far beyond Ellen’s imagination.

Phew.

A cold sweat ran down Ellen's forehead as she hung up the phone.
