"Hyun, have you ever been to the United States?"

Isn't it a voice full of curiosity?

"Excuse me?"

"No, I mean, you don't seem very surprised even when looking at the Golden Gate Bridge. It looks like it's your first time in the U.S. according to your passport, but did you travel abroad frequently for movie shoots when you were young?"

It seemed that Kim Sang-guk expected me, a child, to be excitedly roaming around as soon as I arrived in the U.S.

Of course, it was the year 1997. There was a significant difference between South Korea, which was on the brink of a crisis, and the U.S., which was welcoming the 21st century.

For instance, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Empire State Building in New York, or Las Vegas could all be described as otherworldly. However...

"It's fascinating, but that's all."

Hadn't I visited the U.S. frequently in my past life? The late 20th-century U.S. looked more like a scene from a retro movie than something extraordinary.

It felt as if everyone else saw things through colored lenses while I alone wore gray lenses. That might be why I didn't feel much excitement.

"No matter how I see it, Hyun, it seems you were an American in your past life."

Kim Sang-guk's eyes widened as I skillfully selected and ordered bread to go with the seasonal menu at a 50-year-old Pete's Coffee. It seemed like an old habit came out naturally.

I vaguely explained that I had read about the ordering method in a catalog on the flight to the U.S.

"I didn't expect you to make such a silly joke, Mr. Kim."

"Look at you. Who would think you're a seventeen-year-old high school student?"

I had gotten quite close to Kim Sang-guk by now. The irony was that I never dreamed I would make the Prime Minister I had watched preparing for the National Assembly in my past life my representative.

Kim Sang-guk took a sip of coffee and looked at me intently.

"I'm curious about what your plan is."

I hadn't told Kim Sang-guk the specifics yet. Of course, if he heard my plan, he would undoubtedly call me crazy.

There were countless ways to make money. But coincidentally, the timing never matched up.

Investing in what would become a giant corporation in the future was a good idea, but it would take a long time to bear fruit.

How about trying a big short?

'Tsk.'

No way. During the subprime mortgage crisis, many people dreamed of becoming movie protagonists and making a fortune. There were even those who made astronomical profits through put options.

But were they the only ones who exercised put options? Most investors had the same idea as the protagonists but eventually fell off a cliff because they couldn't time the short correctly, something the movies don't show.

No matter how advanced software becomes, it's impossible to know the detailed trends of foreign stocks that I am unaware of.

I needed a more groundbreaking way to gather funds. Of course, others might see it as reckless.

"To make the movie a reality."

That was my first objective in the U.S.

"It's like looking at Myeongdong."

Hollywood Boulevard is always packed with people. The tall palm trees give a slight resort feel, but the dazzling neon signs and flashing billboards are so bright they hurt your eyes.

Moreover, as time goes by, the number of people increases rather than decreases, making the street even more crowded.

"Mr. Kim, you could have stayed at the hotel."

"How could I let you, a young one, go to such a crowded, remote place alone? If I sent you to the premiere without a guardian, the police would surely arrest me for child abuse."

"Child abuse?"

Ahem, I understood Kim Sang-guk's concern. In some ways, I still had a stronger image of a seventeen-year-old high school student rather than an employer.

In hindsight, I should have taken the car Alessandro sent. I regretted saying I would walk.

"Hyun, is Martina coming to this premiere?"

"Martina?"

"Yes, I've been a huge fan of hers for a long time—!"

It seemed he was more interested in personal gain. Now I realized he wasn't worried about me but was eager to see Martina, the female lead of the movie Paganini. After all, she was voted the sexiest actress in Hollywood.

"Hyun—!"

Just then, an assistant director who had come to greet me waved his hand.

Although it had been a year since we last met, the assistant director was so glad to see me that Kim Sang-guk praised me, saying, "Hyun, you must have been good at socializing."

Thanks to him, I could comfortably make my way to the theater where the premiere was held.

"Hyun, it's been a long time."

"Long time no see, Director."

"And who is this beside you?"

After warmly hugging Director Jean-Pierre, I introduced the awkwardly standing Kim Sang-guk.

"This is my uncle."

Kim Sang-guk briefly cleared his throat at the word "uncle." He seemed at a loss for a more appropriate title, so he stayed silent.

"Alessandro and Martina are probably taking pictures at the photo line."

"Getting out of a long limousine, right? I've seen it a few times in Hollywood columns. Top stars attending premieres."

"Ha-ha, shall we go together then?"

The movie Paganini was competing with blockbuster-level works, but looking at the number of journalists at the premiere, it seemed they were not falling behind. I heard the press preview had received very favorable reviews.

Just in time, Alessandro and Martina were getting out of the arriving limousine from a distance.

"They do look like Paganini and his lover."

They walked the red carpet as if they had stepped right out of the movie poster. Their graceful steps and adept manners clearly showed they were top stars.

Next to me, Kim Sang-guk was staring at Martina with his mouth wide open. The two stood at the photo line.

"Hyun?"

Alessandro recognized me and gradually widened his eyes. Martina, in her red dress, did the same.

The two hastily gestured for me to come over.

Huh?

Before I knew it, I was pushed to the photo line with them. The reporters' faces were full of curiosity.

Alessandro flashed a mischievous smile and positioned me between himself and Martina.

Someone might think we were taking a family photo. Coincidentally, my formal attire matched well with the overall color scheme.

At that moment, Alessandro spoke softly to the reporters.

"This friend is the young Paganini you've all been curious about."

At that instant, dazzling spotlights poured down on me.

Chairman Wang visited the mansion in Ichon-dong for a simple reason: to relay the events of the past few days to an old friend. Although Chairman Wang himself found it amusing to do such things at his age, it was also enjoyable.

"Old man, get up already."

At Chairman Wang's voice, Chairman Yoo, who had been lying on the sickbed, slowly opened his eyes like before.

Despite being bedridden, Chairman Yoo's face was getting plumper day by day instead of becoming gaunt.

It was because the housekeeper had secretly prepared special meals for Chairman Yoo late at night more than once.

"As soon as your children saw me, they fled Ichon-dong like a bat out of hell. Especially your second son, Beom-gyeong, turned pale and ran away as soon as he saw me, probably afraid I'd crack his forehead like yours. How much longer are you going to let them scheme like this?"

"Hand, isn't it fun? They think I'm still out of my mind and say all sorts of things right in front of me. Each time, it feels like the scales are falling from my eyes regarding my children."

"Tsk, if it were up to me, I'd smack everyone except Hyeon and his wife. But you must have your reasons for letting it slide."

Chairman Yoo showed a faint smile. Indeed, he wasn't lying in bed for no reason.

The longer he remained bedridden, the more his children's greed and desires surfaced. Moreover, they would let their guard down.

"Are you aware that Hyun went to the U.S.?"

"I know. He made a firm resolution in front of me the day before he left."

"A resolution?"

How could one not be curious? Wasn't this the high school student who had won over Kim Sang-guk from the Strategic Planning Office?

Chairman Yoo's cryptic smile piqued his curiosity, but he didn't answer.

Chairman Wang recounted the events between Kim Sang-guk and Kang Hyun.

"To rake in money, huh."

"Old man, do you have any idea how?"

"I'm not sure. He didn't use the term 'rake in money' in front of me. Besides, he didn't go to the U.S. just to attend a movie premiere. Hand, what do you think?"

Chairman Wang recalled the various sides Kang Hyun had shown thus far.

Wasn't Hyun someone who revealed a different aspect each time, like peeling an onion? This time, too, he would undoubtedly stir the hearts of the two old men.

"He must be thinking of some extraordinary method."

Just then, they heard a noise from beyond the door, and Chairman Yoo lay back down on the bed.

Chairman Wang was amazed by his friend's cunning. On the other hand, he thought that such secretive movements would prevent bedsores.

"Number 30, $1.2 million—!"

The painting "Shadows in the Mist" by French artist Nicolas Foin. No matter how I looked at it, I was clearly living a life far removed from modern art.

I knew this painting would sell for ten times its current value in the future, but I wasn't particularly interested.

"Number 7, $1.25 million."

"Number 19, $1.3 million."

It was the same auction house I had visited with Im Hyera, except it was in LA this time. Thanks to that, it was easy to prove my identity.

Typically, only the final bidder is named, but since this was a private auction, each bidder was called out individually.

"Hyun, why are we here? Is there a piece you want to buy?"

Kim Sang-guk still looked puzzled. He probably never imagined that we would visit an auction house right after the Hollywood premiere.

Moreover, all the auction items were antiques.

"Yes, there's something I must buy."

"Something you must buy?"

I had confirmed several times through newspapers and news. The auction item I was looking for was definitely coming up at this LA auction.

Like a lion waiting for its prey in the bushes, I leaned back in my chair leisurely.

Even as billions of won were being bid right before my eyes, I didn't flinch, causing Kim Sang-guk to be astounded.

"The next item is 'Lunch with Barbara.'"

The auction room buzzed. Kim Sang-guk also looked puzzled. After all, 'Lunch with Barbara' wasn't a painting. It was literally a lunch.

Who is Barbara, you ask? A Jewish magnate involved in mining, railroads, and real estate. She had put up a lunch for auction long before the Oracle of Omaha did.

"The starting bid for 'Lunch with Barbara' is $10,000, with no minimum increment. The auction proceeds will be donated to the Barbara Foundation's charity fund."

In a way, it was more of an event auction. But given the era, starting at $10,000 for lunch with a magnate was unbelievable, and everyone clicked their tongues. Still, people gradually raised their paddles.

"Number 17, $30,000."

"Number 28, $35,000."

Since there was no minimum increment, people raised their paddles and called out prices.

If I remember correctly, the first auction for 'Lunch with Barbara' historically sold for less than $100,000.

Given that 'Lunch with Barbara' would later fetch billions of won, it was a bargain.

However, considering the era, it was a groundbreaking amount.

"Number 76, $97,000!"

The auctioneer was about to declare it sold and strike the gavel three times.

The room buzzed. The price had quickly shot up, but no higher bids were forthcoming.

Indeed, spending $100,000 on a single lunch was absurd. Even Kim Sang-guk sighed and shook his head.

At that moment...

"$1 million—!"

I raised my paddle and shouted.
