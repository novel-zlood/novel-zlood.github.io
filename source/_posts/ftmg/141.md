"How are you so sure this part is wrong?"

It was a boy who immediately pointed out the mistake in the sheet music.

"The teacher only relied on his ear to write down the notes. That's why he fell into the trap that Paganini set in the movie."

"Trap?"

"The Paganini in this movie seems to be a very playful character. He must have thought someone would rely on their hearing to transcribe his sheet music. To create the same melody as in the movie, the notes must have been like this. May I?"

The boy adeptly borrowed a pen and began to draw notes on the staff as naturally as waves soaking into dry sand.

But that wasn't the end. The boy, seemingly fond of the elderly man sitting next to him, added another comment.

"In the movie, Paganini used a different technique than the known ones."

"A different technique?"

"For example, instead of using bowing or left-hand pizzicato, he created sharp melodies as if the bow and strings were competing against each other. Would you like me to explain that technique too?"

Juilliard's dean, Joseph, struggled to hide his surprise.

The musical knowledge of the boy sitting next to him was beyond what he had expected.

Not only did the boy immediately point out the mistake in the sheet music, but he also talked about Paganini as if he were conversing with Dean Oliver, exuding a sense of experience.

"Can you tell me what technique he used?"

It wasn't the time to be proud. If the boy's words were true, the violinist responsible for the movie's simultaneous recording was indeed a genius.

The boy hesitated for a moment, then once again asked for permission and held Joseph's hand.

"Think of this pen in my right hand as a bow, and I'll touch the invisible strings with my left fingers."

"Could it be this part?"

"Yes, it's the scene where he performs while dancing on the deck."

Joseph could instantly tell how long the boy had been playing the violin. An invisible violin seemed to be playing before his eyes.

At that moment, the boy's fingers were recreating how Paganini performed on a rocking ship.

"I think I should get going now, so I'll write down the remaining part of the sheet music here."

"What?"

Joseph couldn't believe his eyes and ears. He hadn't expected the boy to remember the remaining part of the sheet music that even he couldn't recall.

My goodness—!

Joseph's eyes widened as he received the sheet music. Even after the end credits had rolled, Joseph couldn't move until a theater employee approached him.

He hurriedly looked around for the boy who had been sitting next to him, but he had already disappeared like a ghost.

"Sorry, Yooha."

Kang Hyun's face was evidently troubled. It was understandable since he had left Son Yooha alone and focused on his conversation with the elderly man next to him.

He wanted to repay the audience who had shown great interest in Paganini's melody, but he felt a bit guilty.

"Then have dinner with me—!"

"Dinner?"

"Yes, there's a restaurant I really wanted to go to with you, oppa."

Kang Hyun barely suppressed a laugh. Yooha, pouting with her cheeks puffed out, looked so cute.

He had expected her to say something grand, but her simple wish brought a pleasant smile to his face.

Oh well, it's a time when even a flapping sparrow makes one laugh, but seeing the Ice Queen like this always felt refreshing.

‘Jeil Trading.’

Even the men found it tough there, but she hadn't raised her voice there, had she? Kang Hyun thought about the Son Yooha he had faced in his past life and gently patted her head again.

"Alright, let's eat together."

Meanwhile, Yooha's face turned red like a ripe persimmon, starting from her ears.

"What?"

"I chose it because I thought you would like it, oppa. Is it not good?"

"No way!"

Kang Hyun shook his head vigorously. In a place that's not even Koreatown, there was a Korean restaurant. His mouth watered after suffering from greasy cheese and fatty foods.

Yooha wanted to visit this place because Kang Hyun loved Korean food more than anyone else.

"Oppa, the soybean paste stew here is really delicious—!"

As Kang Hyun took a big spoonful of tofu and soybean paste stew, Yooha's eyes sparkled, waiting for his reaction.

Instead of speaking, Kang Hyun took another big spoonful and put it in his mouth. His cheeks were filled with rice grains and soybean paste stew.

Finally, Yooha, who had been waiting anxiously, smiled bashfully.

"Yooha, is there anything else you want to do?"

"Can I say it? I actually want to see the night view with you, oppa."

"Night view?"

Oh well, there was no reason not to show the night view to Yooha, who was studying hard in a foreign country.

Isn't it dangerous for students to see New York's night view? Don't worry, as a successor of a chaebol family, appropriate security measures were in place.

There were many night view spots in New York, but there was no need to worry about where to go. Yooha eagerly grabbed Kang Hyun's hand and led him.

It was DUMBO, where you could see the city and the Brooklyn Bridge. It was already a famous tourist spot and still is. Following the footsteps of others, Kang Hyun grabbed Yooha's hand.

"Thank you, oppa."

"There's nothing to thank for."

"No, really, thank you—!"

Kang Hyun thought Yooha was admirable. After all, she was still young, wasn't she? But she was much more mature than her peers.

Living alone in a foreign country wasn't easy even for an adult, but she endured it without showing any signs.

Today would surely remain a good memory for her. Like a photo album she could look back on during tough times.

Under the dazzling neon signs of New York, the riverside of the Brooklyn Bridge was glowing in the sunset. A cruise ship was leisurely passing by, and only a gentle breeze was blowing.

Kang Hyun held Yooha's small hand more firmly. At that moment, Yooha was certain that her trembling heart was more intense than the ripples on the water.

"Who could he have been?"

Juilliard dean Joseph swept his face with his wrinkled hand. He muttered to himself, but there was no answer.

His eyes fell on a sheet of music. It was the sheet music written by the mysterious boy he saw at the theater.

"Italy's Verdi, the UK's Royal Academy of Music, Moscow, or maybe Shanghai?"

The names of the world's top music schools flowed from Joseph's lips. If not, maybe the boy was a student at Juilliard, hidden in plain sight.

He regretted not asking for his name. There was a reason Joseph was so regretful.

The sheet music was so precise and elegant as if Paganini himself had written it. Just looking at the notes, the melody from the movie replayed in his mind.

How could it be possible to grasp the entire composition with just one hearing?

"Even I can't do that."

Even Joseph, who had lived his whole life immersed in music, was so impressed that he felt like surrendering. Such talent was indeed enviable.

Moreover, the more he conversed with the boy, the more he found himself enchanted by his words, as if under a spell.

It was a rare sight for Joseph, who was known for his stubbornness and strong opinions.

"Who on earth—!"

Joseph nervously swept his face again.

He tried to recall the boy's face, but it didn't come to mind clearly. The theater was dark, but his focus was more on the voice and sheet music than on the face.

One thing he did remember clearly was the boy's deep eyes. They were clear and transparent, like a lake, leaving a lasting impression.

It was then.

"Dean, may I have a moment?"

It was the voice of Dean Oliver. The reason Dean Oliver came looking for Joseph was to push forward the plan to have Violinist Hyun teach at the institute.

"Dean, what do you mean by having Violinist Hyun teach?"

"He has already lectured to students and faculty in Moscow. Rather than considering his age, how about considering his potential as a musician?"

Dean Oliver wasn't wrong. The melody in the movie 'Paganini' was enough to send shivers down one's spine.

Moreover, he was right about considering him as a musician regardless of his age. If it was the boy Joseph saw at the theater, what did age matter?

Dean Oliver was puzzled by Joseph's calm demeanor. He hadn't expected to persuade him so easily.

"Dean, would you like to see this?"

"What is it?"

"This is the making film shot during the filming of the Paganini movie. Violinist Hyun's performance is featured."

Director Jean-Pierre had requested the making film in a videotape. Dean Oliver thought that if Joseph saw this, he could definitely win him over.

How much time had passed? Shortly after the making film started playing, a loud crashing sound was heard.

"Dean?"

Joseph had stood up abruptly, knocking over his chair, as if he had seen a ghost after confirming the image of Violinist Hyun on the screen.

"Did I grow taller?"

The suit, which had been tailored to fit perfectly, felt a bit short. Looking back at his past life, he had started growing taller around high school, so it wasn't an illusion.

Still, a suit on a young face was still unfamiliar. Although he had lived his entire past life in a suit and tie.

Juilliard School.

Wasn't it the performing arts school with the title of the world's best music school? He never imagined he would be invited there.

The professors he met in Hollywood kept calling him so much that Manager Kim Sang-guk had a hard time for a while.

"Hyun, are you really okay spending your time like this in the U.S.?"

"It's still early."

Manager Kim Sang-guk still had a puzzled expression. He couldn't help it either. Barbara Chan-Kwang's investigation of the exploration area would take time.

Moreover, it took time to ensure that his greedy uncles and aunts at home were firmly hooked.

Hadn't someone said it? The more you hurry, the more mistakes you make.

"I must say, Hyun, you seem to be naturally laid-back."

"Laid-back?"

"Most people can't be that relaxed. Without confidence and courage, they become anxious. In that sense, Hyun, you have strong confidence. Otherwise, how could you come to New York and go on a date? At this rate, I feel like I should learn how to date from you."

Manager Kim Sang-guk joked early in the morning. Come to think of it, in his past life, Prime Minister Kim Sang-guk had married late.

Although he had an attractive face with a square jaw and sharp eyes, he seemed uninterested in dating despite his words.

Oh well, without such ambition, he wouldn't have been able to enter the Blue House.

It was when they were leaving the hotel lobby.

"Oppaa—!"

Son Yooha was running from a distance, carrying lunch boxes in both hands. She must have asked Manager Kim Sang-guk about the timing.

"Yooha, what about school?"

"It's, it's the school's anniversary—!"

"What?"

It was an obvious lie, but what could he do? She was at an age where she could afford to play hooky for a day.

She must have been studying non-stop, so he thought it wouldn't be bad to take her to Juilliard for a tour to clear her head.

Meanwhile, Yooha excitedly showed off the lunch box she had made herself.

She said she woke up early to make it, and looking at the cute contents, it was clear she had made it herself.

"But you can't stay with me the whole time at Juilliard, okay?"

"It's okay!"

"Really?"

It was a tour, not a visit for fun.

Then Yooha added, "Anna unnie bragged so much about your lecture in Moscow—!"

That's when he realized why Yooha had come rushing to him since morning. She wanted to see the side of him that Anna had seen.

At that moment, Manager Kim Sang-guk, who had become a chauffeur, glanced at the rearview mirror and added a comment.

"No matter how you look at it, it's like Romeo and Juliet."

How could she be so happy to see him again?
