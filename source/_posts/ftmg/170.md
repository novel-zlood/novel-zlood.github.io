Thump thump thump.

Son Yooha felt her heart racing without pause. The melody beyond the album seemed to make her heart tremble as if the strings were whispering.

Imagining Kang Hyun playing the violin, her pure white face blushed like a ripe persimmon.

"The piece is so romantic!"

"Michelle, it must have been composed with Yooha in mind—!"

Michelle and Camilla were evaluating Kang Hyun's second album. Even to their ears, the last track was incredibly sweet. The trembling of the strings almost seemed to express the excitement of a romance movie.

"Look at the album cover photo. I never imagined a violinist could be this handsome. He's way better looking than David Johnny."

"Yooha, is that really the oppa from back then? He seems to have grown so tall."

"Yes."

The album cover featured Kang Hyun playing the violin. It seemed like a casual photo taken in a practice room, but it exuded an indescribable charm.

Especially the melancholy eyes beneath his flowing black hair were not just beautiful but almost enchanting. It truly looked like a painting.

"Yooha, what do these letters mean? They look like Hangul."

Michelle asked cautiously, looking at the Hangul written on the album. Even Michelle, who didn't know Hangul, could tell it was more than just a simple signature. As Son Yooha read the letter written by Kang Hyun himself, her face turned red again.

"What does it say?"

The reason Yooha's face turned red was simple. Each letter was filled with Kang Hyun's heartfelt emotions.

Though Michelle and Camilla curiously asked again, Yooha only showed a shy smile without answering. It was a story shared only between Kang Hyun and herself.

At that moment, Camilla, who had been reading a column, suddenly widened her eyes and exclaimed.

"Look at this! According to Forbes, Hyun, the violinist, is listed as the world's most attractive musician. Not just pop music but the first violinist to be named at the age of nineteen in classical music—!"

"Even at our school, everyone is buzzing about Hyun these days. Esther from class A said she bought ten copies of Hyun's latest album. She was bragging about how she went to another state to get it because it was sold out nationwide."

Just as Michelle and Camilla said, Kang Hyun's popularity was beyond imagination.

The reason why even American teenage girls, who could be considered outsiders to classical music, showed such immense interest in Kang Hyun was simple.

His appearance while holding the bow was so mesmerizing that it couldn't even be compared to most movie stars.

Some people even exaggeratedly said that Violinist Hyun's aura reminded them of Edward Furlong, the former CK model, from the past.

"Yooha, you must be nervous. If he's this popular in the U.S., imagine how popular Violinist Hyun must be in Korea."

At that moment, Yooha's eyes sparkled upon hearing Michelle's words.

"Junior, eat a lot."

Director Kim Sang-guk felt full just by looking at Kang Hyun in front of him.

Somehow, he found himself coming to Korea University every other day for investment result reports, but he didn't mind at all.

Of course, Kang Hyun's investment proposals were as flawless as a well-crafted puzzle.

"Director, aren't you tired of eating tteokbokki and sundae every time?"

"Isn't this the romance of college life? You might not know, but this snack bar has a long history, even before I entered university. Look at the names of Korea University alumni filling the walls. If you look closely, you might find someone who will be the future president of Korea."

Director Kim Sang-guk wasn't exaggerating. Korea University was the pinnacle of Korea's college entrance exams.

"Then a Prime Minister could definitely come from here too?"

"Of course."

Kang Hyun showed a faint smile.

In his past life, the first time he met Director Kim Sang-guk was at the Blue House. Back then, Kim Sang-guk, the Prime Minister, had sharp eyes and a chiseled jaw but wasn't someone who smiled as much as he does now.

"Purchase more of Barbara Mining."

"Barbara Mining? The stock that's already considered to have risen to its peak?"

"Yes."

Kang Hyun answered without hesitation. Director Kim Sang-guk looked puzzled.

Barbara Mining's stock had been on the rise ever since they discovered a gold mine in Nepal thanks to Kang Hyun. Now, it was believed to have peaked, and no other gold mines had been found yet. People would say it's like catching the top.

"Did you contact Chairman Barbara?"

"No, I haven't been in touch much in recent years except for greetings."

Kang Hyun had a reason for pushing the purchase of Barbara Mining's stocks. Barbara Mining would soon discover a new gold mine.

Not just a gold mine, but the discovery of the world's largest copper deposit was a hot topic in the early 2000s in his past life.

After that, Barbara Mining's stock price skyrocketed, causing several circuit breakers. Even Kang Hyun, who had no interest in stocks back then, vividly remembered the news.

"Understood, I'll proceed as per your instructions."

"Thank you for trusting me, Director."

"By the way, I heard your album is incredibly popular among teenagers these days?"

Kang Hyun just smiled faintly without denying it. Nowadays, when walking around, it wasn't uncommon to hear the classical music he composed.

Perhaps because of the melancholy photo on the album cover, the number of female student fans had increased significantly. Rumor had it that a fan club had even been established.

"My niece is also a huge fan of yours. She never used to listen to classical music, but now she plays your music every time she studies. My sister-in-law is so happy. There's a rumor among mothers that listening to your music makes kids smarter."

"Makes them smarter?"

"Of course, you're the first perfect scorer in the history of the College Scholastic Ability Test. By the way, aren't you going to any school meetings these days? Surely you're not attending classes alone, are you?"

Even if he wanted to, he couldn't. Kim Daewoo was always sticking to him like glue.

Moreover, Kim Daewoo had somehow become the class representative for the first-years, so there were always classmates around him.

Quite a contrast to his past life, where he was holed up in a study room memorizing law books. And meetings, of all things.

"Getting caught at a meeting would be a disaster."

"A disaster?"

Director Kim Sang-guk asked curiously, but then clapped his hands as if he realized something and mentioned a name.

"Yooha!"

The 90s were the golden age of the music market.

Shin Seung-hun's fifth album sold 2.1 million copies, Seo Taiji and Boys' second album "Hayeoga" sold 2.2 million copies, and Kim Gun-mo's third album "Wrongful Meeting" sold 2.5 million copies, marking the million-seller era of the 90s music market.

"How many copies is this?"

Director Im Hyera was speechless as she looked at the numbers. The initial stock assigned by EMA had sold out, and the distribution industry was repeatedly requesting more prints.

At this rate, it wouldn't be surprising if Kang Hyun's classical album became the first million-seller in Korea's music industry.

"Director, we've been receiving endless interview requests from TV stations since morning. They seem ready to rush over with cameras and reporters as soon as we give the word. Even the publishers are so eager that our phones are practically on fire."

Kang Hyun's album had been making headlines since its release. The entire nation was abuzz, to say the least.

From classical music enthusiasts to those smitten by Kang Hyun's looks, and even expectant mothers choosing his album for prenatal music, the buzz was everywhere.

"Tom Smith even contacted us, expressing a desire to work with Hyun."

"Wait, Ms. Mihyun. Are you talking about the British photographer Tom Smith?"

"Yes, Director. Tom Smith himself called, saying he was captivated by the album cover photo and wants to work with Hyun if the opportunity arises."

Im Hyera barely managed to suppress a gasp of astonishment.

Who was Tom Smith? A world-renowned photographer whom even famous Hollywood actors aspired to work with.

Moreover, he came from a British aristocratic family and couldn't be simply hired with money.

Rumor had it that the legendary British rock band Sis had to beg Tom Smith multiple times to get their photos taken by him.

And yet, such a high-profile artist reached out first.

Gulp.

Director Im Hyera's throat moved as she looked at the album cover featuring Kang Hyun.

Her astonishment was simple to explain. She had expected a syndrome, but its scope was far beyond her imagination.

How far would it go? It was now unfathomably immense.

"So, is there any student who knows the liability of Party A and Party B in this case?"

The old professor scanned the students with sharp eyes, but none of the German Language and Literature students, nor the Law students, dared to speak.

Though it was a first-year general education class, its level and content were as high as upper-grade major courses.

The professor's gaze landed on Kang Hyun, who hadn't raised his hand but seemed to be getting a signal.

"I'm not expecting a perfect answer. Just share your thoughts. Law should be based on common sense, after all. If you get this question right, I'll give you extra credit for the semester."

Several students raised their hands at the mention of extra credit, but it was hard to satisfy the professor's intellectual appetite.

Though a German Language and Literature student, Kang Hyun finally raised his hand, unable to ignore the professor's persistent gaze.

"Oh, Kang Hyun, let's hear your thoughts. It's okay if you're wrong; just share your unfiltered opinion."

How could he be wrong? Studying for the bar exam involved reading numerous cases, including the one the professor mentioned.

He remembered the case details, prosecutor's indictment, and even the Supreme Court's ruling.

As a non-law student, there was no need to be too detailed. The liabilities of Party A and Party B were clearly and concisely organized in Kang Hyun's mind.

"Hyun, you're good at German, but you're also good at law?"

"I just remember it. I like German more for now."

Kim Daewoo made a puzzled face as he followed Kang Hyun.

"By the way, Hyun, how about a group blind date with the dance department? They seem to be eagerly waiting for you."

"I'm not interested."

"Come on, think about it again. The new students in the dance department are rumored to be stunning."

Though group blind dates were considered a college romance, what could he do? In his past life too, Kang Hyun never found such meetings particularly interesting.

No matter how much Kim Daewoo tried to persuade him, it was like reading a book to a cow.

Eventually, Kim Daewoo gave up and asked with a forlorn expression.

"Hyun, do you have someone you like?"

"Why?"

"Well, it's just odd that you keep turning down so many girls who like you. I'd be over the moon."

Kang Hyun thought Kim Daewoo was simple-minded. He would probably mature after serving in the military. Just then,

"Wow—!"

"What?"

"Hyun, look over there. She's stunning. I've never seen someone like her in our college. At first, I thought she was a celebrity!"

Kim Daewoo exclaimed. As he said, a female student stood in front of their department building.

Her long black hair that reached her waist and her milk-white skin were quite contrasting.

Moreover, her cat-like eyes and high-bridged nose were as beautiful as those painted by a famous artist.

Though her tightly closed lips made her look cold, they also made her seem alluring.

As Kang Hyun scrutinized her face, his eyes widened in surprise.
