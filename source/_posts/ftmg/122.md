"The members are extremely dissatisfied."

A somewhat agitated voice was heard.

"Maestro, how about releasing the video now?"

Worry was evident on the face of Samuel, the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic.

The Berlin Philharmonic is a symphony orchestra boasting a long history, and the members' musical pride is incomparable, soaring as high as Mount Tai.

It's often said that joining the Berlin Philharmonic is more difficult than winning international competitions.

"As you know, there has never been a sudden selection of an alternate member in the history of the Berlin Philharmonic. If it were any conductor other than Maestro, the members would have protested. Remember the chief conductor who was ousted decades ago for selecting members at his own whim?"

"Indeed, only such standards can define a musician of the Berlin Philharmonic."

"Maestro?"

All the members were harboring discontent. The fact that a young violinist, who had not even graduated from high school, was invited as an alternate member was the reason.

No matter how internationally promising a newcomer might be, the Berlin Philharmonic is not a place anyone can enter.

It wasn't enough to rise from the bottom; the sudden descent from the sky naturally led to great dissatisfaction.

This place could easily be seen as a battlefield, not a school.

"Samuel, do you think revealing the video will change the members' minds?"

"I cannot guarantee it."

"Right, it's not my role to change their minds; it's up to Hyun in the future."

Relaxation filled Yuri, the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic. There was no sign of anxiety as he lightly sipped from his teacup.

"Perhaps the one being tested now is not that child."

"Excuse me?"

"It might be that Maestro Spencer in London and I are the ones being tested. Do you think there has ever been a musician who has experienced both London and Berlin simultaneously?"

Samuel could not easily open his mouth.

Like the Berlin Philharmonic, the London Symphony also boasted the highest authority as a symphony orchestra. There would have been very few musicians who could freely come and go between the two. It would be counted on one hand for sure.

"By now, he would be in London. There will probably be resistance there too, but not as much as here. They've already experienced Hyun once. Samuel, you called him an alternate member?"

"Yes, Maestro."

"Let's correct that. I don't consider that child an alternate member, as Maestro Gustav mentioned."

What did this mean?

"The choice will be made by that child, not us."

* * *

Kang Hyun suddenly recalled a music movie he had seen in his past life.

It was about an orphan with extraordinary musical talent playing the guitar on the streets to find his parents.

Talent knows no place; people passing through the park had all stopped to listen to the child's performance.

Despite the gazes of many people, he unfolded his music. Kang Hyun felt the same way as that child.

Was he nervous? Hardly. Rather, the excitement calmed down as he raised his bow.

Ziiing―!

The bow seemed to glide gently over the strings, but a sharp high note resounded.

As if plucking the bow, his left hand moved dazzlingly over the strings, and the melody sprang up like a coil. The members of the London Symphony observed the scene as an audience.

It was fair to call it a kind of test. Even in the prosecutor's office, it was common in May to assign ridiculous tasks to gauge the capabilities of new recruits.

'Wow.'

Christine was struggling to suppress her admiration. Though she tried to hide it, the joy on her face was evident. She had sensed something extraordinary when correcting his posture, but not to this extent.

He was only seventeen. Yet, what was that dazzling technique and calm gaze?

Each note was imbued with power, as if his fingers were several times more agile than others.

From his shoulder to his elbow and down to his fingertips, every movement was flawless, as if he had become one with the violin.

"Hyun, what was the piece you just played? No matter how hard I search my memory, it's a melody I've never heard."

"I haven't named it yet. It's number 67, Emanuel."

"Number 67?"

When it was revealed that the piece was Kang Hyun's original composition, the members of the London Symphony were collectively astonished.

Number 67, no less. Did this mean there were still more scores left, aside from the original compositions he had showcased in solo concerts?

Just as everyone was gradually becoming more and more shocked,

"That's enough playing. Everyone, take your seats."

Maestro Spencer entered the practice room with the concertmaster. Truly professional, the members flawlessly returned to their places with just one word from Spencer.

The previous commotion was instantly quelled, as if erased with a single stroke of an eraser.

"Hyun, sit here."

Spencer seated Kang Hyun next to him, just like when he had visited Korea. It was a spot where the members could see him best, just like the conductor.

The seating for the members of the London Symphony was flexible. Except for the first violins, all the seating arrangements could change slightly according to Spencer's wishes.

For example, sometimes the positions of the cellos and violas would be swapped, and the places for the percussion instruments would be changed as well.

Everything had to maintain optimal condition, so it changed fluidly depending on the symphony to be performed and the state of the concert hall.

"Hyun, I will now conduct a symphony for you. Conducting is akin to handling a giant instrument. That instrument holds dozens of melodies and dozens of thoughts. Hyun, can you persuade that giant instrument?"

The members were busy tuning to the oboe's pitch. Wasn't this a place where people of various races and instruments gathered? Each one must have reached the London Symphony after grueling efforts.

Kang Hyun understood Spencer's last words. If they did not recognize him as a conductor, he would never hear the resonance of that giant instrument.

While Yuri in Berlin emphasized technical aspects, Spencer in London valued communication with the members more.

"A week. Convince them as a conductor, not as a violinist. And then conduct this symphony just like I do now."

The members did not yet know that Kang Hyun wanted to learn conducting. They thought he came to the London Symphony as a violinist.

Conducting is impossible without experience and years of practice. How could he possibly move the hearts of such noble musicians?

"Since you told me you wanted to learn conducting, you must have anticipated this much, right?"

"Yes, Maestro."

Despite the daunting task, Kang Hyun's expression remained unchanged. It was as if he had expected Spencer's challenge.

At that moment, Spencer nodded with a peculiar expression. All the tuning was now complete.

"Beethoven's Fate."

The orchestra was in unison.

The moment Maestro's fingertips were raised, the members' gazes changed uniformly. As if they had made an agreement.

* * *

"Mr. Kang Hyun, where should we go?"

A black man who resembled the Terminator was speaking. He always wore a suit and sunglasses, making him look like a secret agent.

He was a bodyguard assigned to me by Director Im Hyera. I heard he was from the overseas branch of the Jeil Group.

When I was told that someone who liked me the most in London was waiting, I hadn't expected it to be Denzel Washington from "Man on Fire."

"Chrissy, please speak comfortably. People might think we're in the military."

"No, it's more comfortable for me to speak this way on duty. In Afghanistan, I spoke even more briefly. Long transmissions were not allowed."

"Pardon?"

Given his appearance, Afghanistan would be nothing. He looked like he could eliminate terrorists while crossing Lebanon and Israel.

No ordinary man would dare challenge him after seeing those thick hands. Moreover, his habit of occasionally chewing one side of his cheek suggested a mercenary's life.

In my previous life as a prosecutor, I had met retired soldiers with similar habits. It was said to be a way to stay sane amid a blood-spattered battlefield.

"Mr. Kang Hyun, shall I guide you to a restaurant then?"

I was hungry. Hadn't I been cooped up in the practice room all day?

During the week that Maestro Spencer had promised me, I had been pondering how to convince the members but couldn't come to a clear conclusion.

My mind was as tangled as a ball of yarn.

"Canary Wharf?"

Chrissy glanced at me through the rearview mirror. Seeing the familiar scenery outside the car window, I shook my head.

I had been to this place in my previous life. Isn't it located in the eastern part of London, facing the Thames River? I had visited this place filled with movie-like restaurants in my past life for this reason:

'Tsk.'

It was for a honeymoon I didn't even want to remember. It had been a marriage made for ambition. I couldn't even remember what my past wife looked like anymore.

No wonder, as all our conversations during the marriage were always formalities.

"Good River, this is a restaurant I frequented since childhood."

"Is this really the place?"

"Yes, it is. Do you know it?"

I was astonished when Chrissy guided me to the restaurant.

This was the place where I had dined with my wife in my previous life. Forced to go on a honeymoon, we had eaten without exchanging a word. The Thames River's night view outside the window sparkled like jewels, but I had no time to care.

"Mr. Kang Hyun, if you mention your name upon entering, they will guide you to your seat."

"Chrissy, aren't you joining me for the meal?"

"I will be waiting nearby. Someone is waiting for you today."

What was this supposed to mean?

Someone was waiting for me in this foreign land. But Chrissy said no more.

I guess I'll have to remove those sunglasses. I couldn't read his expression at all.

I reluctantly entered the restaurant. The ship's horn was still blowing continuously at this hour.

"Kang Hyun."

When I told the restaurant manager my name, the well-mustached manager smiled broadly as if he had been waiting.

Following his steps, I saw a seat with a clear view of the Thames River.

And indeed, as Chrissy had mentioned earlier, there was already a guest sitting there.

"What is this?"

A girl with a familiar hairpin was waiting for me.

Her eyes, resembling those of a proud cat, looked towards the Thames River but quickly turned to me when she heard my voice.

The girl's sudden approach made me wonder if this was a dream or reality.

Thinking about it, it must be vacation time in the U.S. But this was too sudden.

"Oppa, did you forget our promise again?"

"What?"

"You said you'd hug me first―!"

At that moment, Son Yooha rushed forward and embraced me tightly.
