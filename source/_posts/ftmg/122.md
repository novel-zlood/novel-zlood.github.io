“단원들의 불만이 이만저만이 아닙니다.”

A rather agitated voice flowed out.

“Maestro, how about releasing the video even now?”

The face of Samuel, the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic, was clearly filled with worry.

The Berlin Philharmonic is a symphony orchestra boasting a long history, and the musical pride of its members is unparalleled and as high as a mountain.

It is often said that joining the Berlin Philharmonic is harder than winning an international competition.

“As you know, there has never been a time in the history of the Berlin Philharmonic when a preliminary member was selected so suddenly. If it wasn’t Maestro but another conductor, there would have been a protest by the members. Didn’t a chief conductor get chased out decades ago for selecting members at his own discretion?”

“Well, of course, you have to be at that level to be called a musician of the Berlin Philharmonic.”

“Maestro?”

The members were all discontented because a young violinist, who hadn’t even graduated high school, was invited as a preliminary member.

No matter how internationally promising they are, the Berlin Philharmonic is not a place anyone can enter easily.

It wasn’t enough to rise from the bottom, but it seemed like they suddenly fell from the sky, so the discontent was bound to be big.

This place was not a school but could be seen as a frontline.

“Samuel, do you think the members' minds will change even if we release the video?”

“I can’t guarantee it.”

“Right, changing their minds is not my role but Hyun's role in the future.”

The face of Yuri, the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic, was full of leisure. There was no sign of anxiety in his appearance as he lightly sipped from a teacup.

“Maybe the one being tested right now is not that child.”

“Pardon?”

“I mean that it might be Maestro Spencer of London and I who are being tested. Do you think there has ever been a musician who has experienced both London and Berlin at the same time?”

Samuel couldn’t easily open his mouth.

Just like the Berlin Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra also boasted the highest prestige in the world. Was there ever a musician who could freely go back and forth between these two places? It would be very few.

“By now, they would be in London, and there might be some resistance there as well, but it won’t be as big as here. They have already experienced Hyun once. Samuel, you said a preliminary member, right?”

“Yes, Maestro.”

“Let’s correct that statement. I don’t think of that child as a preliminary member. As Maestro Gustav said.”

What could this mean?

“The choice will be made not by us but by that child.”

* * *

Kang Hyun suddenly recalled a music movie he had seen in his past life.

It was about a genius musician who played the guitar on the streets to find his parents.

Talent does not choose a place, and people passing through the park stopped all at once at the child’s performance.

He performs his music regardless of the gazes of many people. Kang Hyun felt the same way as that child.

Was he not nervous? Not at all, rather the excitement he felt calmed down when he lifted the bow.

Bzzzt―!

The bow seemed to lightly cross the strings, but a sharp high-pitched sound resonated.

As if plucking the bow, his left hand moved dazzlingly over the strings, and the melody bounced like a spring. The members of the London Symphony Orchestra watched the scene as the audience.

It could be said to be a kind of test. The same could often be seen in the prosecution every May. Didn’t they give absurd tasks to assess the capabilities of the probational officers?

‘Wow.’

Christine struggled to contain her admiration. However, she couldn’t hide the delight on her face. She knew he was extraordinary when she corrected his posture, but to this extent?

He was only seventeen. Yet what was with that dazzling technique and calm gaze?

Each note was powerful as if he had several times more fingers than others.

From the shoulders to the elbows to the fingertips, every single process was flawless. It was as if he had become one with the violin.

“Hyun, what was the name of the piece you just played? No matter how much I search my mind, it’s a melody I’ve never heard before.”

“I haven’t decided on a title yet. It’s numbered 67, Emanuel.”

“67?”

When it was revealed that it was Kang Hyun’s original composition, the members of the London Symphony Orchestra all stuck out their tongues.

Moreover, 67. Did that mean there were still more scores left besides the original compositions presented at the solo recital?

Just as everyone was gradually becoming astonished,

“Let's stop the performance and everyone take their seats.”

Maestro Spencer entered the practice room with the concertmaster. Truly, a pro was a pro. At Spencer’s words, the members found their places in perfect order.

The disturbance from a moment ago was instantly calmed as if erased by an eraser.

“Hyun, sit here.”

Spencer seated Kang Hyun next to him, just as he had when he visited Korea before. It was a position where the members could see him well, just like the conductor.

The seating arrangement within the London Symphony was variable. Except for the first violin, all positions changed slightly according to Spencer’s will.

For example, the positions of cellos and violas could be switched, and the positions of percussion instruments could be changed as well.

Everything had to be maintained in the best condition, so it often changed depending on the symphony to be performed and the state of the concert hall.

“Hyun, I’m going to let you hear a symphony from now. Conducting is similar to handling a huge instrument. That instrument holds dozens of melodies and dozens of thoughts. Hyun, can you persuade that huge instrument?”

The members were busy tuning to the sound of the oboe. This was a place where various races and instruments gathered. They must have all entered the London Symphony after bone-crushing efforts.

Kang Hyun understood Spencer’s final words. If they didn’t recognize him as a conductor, he definitely wouldn’t hear the resonance of that huge instrument.

Unlike Yuri in Berlin, who emphasized technical aspects, Spencer in London placed more importance on rapport with the members.

“The deadline is one week. Try to persuade them as a conductor, not a violinist. Then conduct this symphony the same way I do now.”

The members didn’t know yet that Kang Hyun wanted to learn conducting. They would just think he visited the London Symphony as a violinist.

Conducting is impossible without experience and maturity. How should he move the hearts of those noble musicians?

“Did you anticipate this much when you said you wanted to learn conducting from me?”

“Yes, Maestro.”

Despite the daunting task, Kang Hyun’s expression remained unchanged. It was as if he had anticipated Spencer’s assignment.

At that moment, Spencer showed a subtle expression and nodded. Now all the tuning was done.

“Beethoven’s ‘Fate.’”

The orchestra was of one breath.

The moment the maestro’s fingertips were raised, the members’ gazes changed all at once, as if promised.

* * *

“Kang Hyun, where should I go?”

He was a black man who resembled the Terminator. He always wore a suit and sunglasses, making him look like a secret agent.

He was the guardian assigned to me by Director Im Hyera. I heard he was from a foreign branch of the Jeil Group.

They said someone who liked me the most in London was waiting for me, and to my surprise, it was Denzel Washington from “Man on Fire.”

“Chris, you can speak comfortably. If anyone sees, they might think this is the military.”

“No, it's more comfortable for me to speak this way while on duty. In Afghanistan, I spoke even shorter. We couldn’t make long transmissions.”

“What?”

Well, judging by his appearance, Afghanistan was nothing. He looked sturdy enough to eliminate terrorists while crossing Lebanon and Israel.

Anyone seeing those thick hands wouldn’t dare to mess with him. Moreover, the habit of occasionally biting one cheek seemed like he had lived a mercenary life.

The retired soldiers I met while working in the prosecution in my past life also had such habits. It was to keep their sanity on the blood-splattered battlefield.

“Kang Hyun, may I guide you to a restaurant?”

I was hungry. Hadn’t I been cooped up in the practice room all day?

Despite pondering over and over how to persuade the members within the one week Maestro Spencer had promised me, I couldn’t come to a clear conclusion.

It was when my head felt as tangled as a ball of thread.

“Canary Wharf?”

Chris glanced at me through the rearview mirror. Seeing the familiar scenery outside the window, I shook my head.

This was a place I had visited in my past life. It was located facing the Thames River in the eastern part of London. The reason I visited this place in my past life was this.

‘Tsk.’

It was because of the honeymoon I didn’t want to remember. In a way, wasn’t it a marriage for ambition? Now, I couldn’t even remember what my ex-wife looked like.

Of course, all the conversations during the marriage were always formal.

“Good River, this is a restaurant I’ve frequented since I was young.”

“Is this really the place?”

“Yes, but do you know this place?”

I was surprised at the restaurant Chris guided me to.

This was the place where I had dined with my ex-wife in my past life. On the forced honeymoon, we ate without even talking to each other. Although the night view of the Thames River outside the window sparkled like jewels, there was no chance to care.

“Kang Hyun, if you tell them your name, they will guide you to your seat.”

“Chris, aren’t you going to eat with me?”

“I’ll be waiting nearby. Today, someone is waiting for you specifically.”

What was this about?

Someone waiting for me in a foreign country far away. But Chris didn’t speak further.

I had no choice but to enter the restaurant. The ship’s horn kept blaring even at this hour.

“Kang Hyun.”

When I told the restaurant manager my name, he smiled broadly as if he had been waiting for me.

Following his footsteps, I saw a seat with a clear view of the Thames River.

But just as Chris said earlier, there was already someone sitting at the table.

“That?”

A girl with a familiar hairpin was waiting for me.

Her eyes, like those of a haughty cat, were looking at the Thames River and quickly turned to me at my voice.

As the girl approached me suddenly, I was confused if this was a dream or reality.

Come to think of it, it must be vacation in the U.S. by now. But wasn’t this too sudden?

“Oppa, did you forget the promise again?”

“What?”

“You said you would hug me first―!”
