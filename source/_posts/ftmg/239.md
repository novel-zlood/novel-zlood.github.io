"Tanya, who won the bid for this lunch?"

Having lunch with Barbara was such a prized auction item at Sotheby's that it was called the 'Golden Hour.'

The privilege was simply to have lunch with Chairman Barbara, but since it only happened once a year and considering the counterpart, the price and competition soared every year.

"It's someone named Ayasaki Hideo."

"Ayasaki Hideo?"

"He is a member of a retainer family that has been passed down from generation to generation in Japan. Although he is the eldest son of the Hideo family, he did not take over the family business. He has been known for his exceptional intellect and his ability to read the stock market, making a name for himself in the securities industry. His skills and recognition are exceptional for his young age, to the extent that he has received love calls from the Japanese political world."

Chairman Barbara nodded briefly. She hadn't expected a Japanese person to win the Golden Hour. Most people who wanted to have lunch with her were wealthy individuals from America and Europe.

After all, only such people would pay millions of dollars just to converse with her.

"Also, even though he is Japanese, he is recognized for his abilities on Wall Street. It is said that EPE directly scouted him as an executive because of his exceptional stock market reading skills."

"He's working on Wall Street?"

"Yes, on Wall Street, they call him the 'Flesh-colored Bull.'"

Upon hearing the term 'Flesh-colored Bull,' Chairman Barbara chuckled.

The bull is a landmark representing Wall Street and a term symbolizing a bullish market. What kind of person could he be to be called the Flesh-colored Bull?

"It's an honor to meet you, I am Ayasaki Hideo!"

As she heard, he was a young Asian man.

Chairman Barbara greeted him in a cozy restaurant. It was a famous restaurant in Manhattan where it was hard to get a reservation.

Moreover, it was lunchtime. However, in the spacious restaurant, only Chairman Barbara and Ayasaki Hideo were sitting across from each other.

"What do you think about EPE's investment direction, Chairman?"

Chairman Barbara answered Ayasaki Hideo's questions smoothly even during the meal.

As heard, he had an exceptional intellect and outstanding ability to read the stock market. Barbara found the conversation quite interesting as he made assumptions that ordinary people couldn't think of.

However, his ability to read the stock market was excellent, but he felt completely different from Kang Hyun.

After all, Kang Hyun seemed to have the insight to see the future. To compare with him, one would have to bring in Warren Buffett, the so-called emperor of investment.

"Chairman, may I ask you one more question if it's not too much trouble?"

"Of course. This is time purely paid for by Mr. Hideo. I will answer any questions you have."

"Thank you so much."

Ayasaki Hideo was sincerely grateful.

Someone who didn't know might think it unnecessary to be so grateful for spending millions of dollars, but the conversation he had with Chairman Barbara was worth more than that.

"There is a rumor that the Barbara Group has completely withdrawn its investment in the pharmaceutical company AOA. While Wall Street dismisses it as a baseless rumor, I thought otherwise."

"Mr. Hideo, you are correct. It's not a baseless rumor."

"Can I ask why you withdrew the investment in AOA? With my limited knowledge, I can't find any reason to withdraw the investment in AOA. The clinical trials for the new drug were successful, and both Wall Street and institutional investors are moving significantly. Originally, Barbara Group had the opportunity to secure the highest stake and lead the way, didn't it?"

Chairman Barbara picked up a teacup, sipped from it, and placed it down with a sound.

"Because I received advice."

"Advice?"

Ayasaki Hideo looked puzzled. Who could possibly give advice to Chairman Barbara?

In a world where wealthy people are willing to pay millions of dollars just to have lunch with her, even the owner of the White House would need to make an appointment and wait to meet her.

The only people who could give advice to Chairman Barbara would be her parents. Just then, as if reading Hideo's thoughts, Chairman Barbara added.

"It's someone I can trust and rely on completely. If it's his advice, withdrawing the investment wasn't difficult."

"Was that advice worth more than the practical benefits of investing in AOA?"

"Mr. Hideo, you are mistaken. Advice is just advice. The decision is solely mine. The same goes for our meeting today. I gave you various pieces of advice, but listening and choosing is solely up to you. I just entirely trust the person who gave me the advice. Isn't trust something invaluable that can't be converted into a price?"

Ayasaki Hideo nodded as if he had realized something and looked at Chairman Barbara.

"Chairman, can you tell me who that person is?"

Chairman Barbara smiled as if she had expected that.

By now, countless names of people might be flashing through Hideo's mind. From prominent figures in the American political and business circles to Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. As the names of legendary figures passed by, Chairman Barbara started to speak.

"Oppa, is your ear itchy?"

As Kang Hyun scratched his earlobe, Yooha looked at him with a puzzled expression.

As Yooha, whose head was touching his shoulder, looked up, Kang Hyun felt she looked like a cute puppy. He patted her head and smiled.

"Someone must be talking about me."

"It's probably the kids from my school. Do you know that since you gave a lecture, even the boys have become your fans?"

"The boys?"

"Yes, really. Kids who didn't usually talk about classical music nowadays talk about you. Moreover, the students who are confirmed to go to MIT already think of you as a genius. Especially Carlile, who talked with you about Gryphon."

Kang Hyun never thought that even boys would like him. But thinking about the lecture at Phillips, it wasn't surprising. Even the students from the prestigious high school were amazed by Kang Hyun's knowledge.

"So, when are you coming back today?"

"I'll decide after having a meeting with the New York Philharmonic."

"Hee-ing."

It was as if she was a puppy waiting eagerly for him at home.

Yooha also probably wanted to go with Kang Hyun, but she volunteered to stay in the studio, thinking she might be a disturbance. Kang Hyun stood up with a promise to come back right after the meeting. At that moment.

Smooch.

Yooha grabbed Kang Hyun's sleeve and kissed his cheek as he stood up. As Kang Hyun smiled at the pleasant feeling, Yooha's face turned as red as a ripe persimmon.

Although she might resemble the ice queen from his past life on the outside, she was still a shy and demure girl.

"Really nice to see you, Hyun!"

It was Antonio, the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic. He welcomed Kang Hyun with exaggerated gestures, so warmly that it was almost burdensome for Kang Hyun.

It was a baseless worry to think that concertmasters are cold and cynical, remembering Dmitri from the London Symphony.

"I always make sure to watch your performances on video. If Korea were a country closer to the U.S., I would come to Korea every time just to see your performance. You wanted to collaborate with our orchestra for this concert piece, right?"

No matter how high the reputation of Director Jim Filmer was, the orchestra had its own rules.

Historically prestigious and accomplished orchestras were known for not participating in commercial movies and dramas.

In that sense, the New York Philharmonic had an outstanding reputation, comparable to when Empress Karas led the Berlin Philharmonic.

"The maestro is also considering it positively. Our members feel the same. If it weren't for you, Mr. Hyun, it would have been impossible. You will find out when you meet our maestro; he is quite conservative. If he hadn't personally seen your performance at the British Royal Concert, he would have definitely refused even with a sword to his neck."

After all, a young Asian boy conducted the British Royal Concert.

That too, in England, where racism was as severe as in Europe. Moreover, conducting was a field where skill was recognized regardless of age and gender.

The sight of a young Asian boy skillfully conducting the London Symphony members was shocking not only to the public but also to many maestros.

Even years later, it was still talked about, proving its impact.

"Actually, I have been looking forward to collaborating with you, Mr. Hyun, even if it wasn't for this event. I heard you did quite a lot at the Royal Academy of Music. Especially the concert stories were amazing. The students at the Royal Academy are also geniuses, but you stood out even among them."

"You know about the Royal Academy of Music concert?"

"Haha, I have an old friend working as an associate professor at the Royal Academy. I hear about you without missing a thing from him."

How much time passed? Antonio was very good at conversing.

Even though Kang Hyun was not very talkative, Antonio filled the gaps with continuous conversation. Especially, Antonio recited the repertoire of Kang Hyun's performances as if he had them memorized, proving he really watched them all.

Kang Hyun wondered if Antonio might be the head of the F.H (Forever Hyun) fan club branch in New York.

At that moment.

"Maestro!"

Antonio stood up suddenly. Through the wide-open door, the maestro of the New York Philharmonic and Director Jim Filmer were walking in together.

But their expressions were not good. At that moment, Director Jim Filmer looked at Kang Hyun with an astonished expression.

"Hyun, who are the reporters waiting outside?"

"Pardon? Reporters?"

"Yes, reporters. They are camped outside the studio, knowing somehow!"

It was puzzling. Only a few people knew about the meeting between Kang Hyun and the New York Philharmonic at Director Jim Filmer's studio.

But that was not the only surprising thing. Director Jim Filmer swallowed hard and added seriously.

"I asked a reporter I know, and they said there's a strange rumor on Wall Street."

"A rumor?"

"Yes, about the big hand that moved Chairman Barbara Tannenbaum of the Barbara Group."

That is.
