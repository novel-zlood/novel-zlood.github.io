“Father―!”

A rather unwelcoming voice was heard from downstairs. It seemed that the aunt who had visited Ichon-dong before had come again.

The aunt's face was filled with a sense of solemnity. Her attire was more modest than usual, likely to avoid offending Grandfather.

Moreover, she had brought along her son, Yoo Jinseok, almost as if he were a handbag.

“Auntie, it's heavy, so please take it quickly.”

Wow, the golden cloth bundle she was holding was bulging. It was obvious that the food inside was made by someone else, but she would undoubtedly boast that she made it herself without getting a single drop of water on her hands, just like before.

Just then, Grandfather walked out of his study.

“What brings you here?”

“Father, is this a place I can't come to? The weather is hot, and I know you can't stand the heat well. I brought some refreshing chogye-tang for you to help with your health. It will taste better than the samgyetang made by Hyunja. Jinseok, greet your grandfather quickly.”

“Grandfather, how have you been?”

Anyone would think he had just returned from Cheonghak-dong. Yoo Jinseok, bowing his head with a tense expression, hadn't changed a bit, still timid like his parents. He couldn't even make proper eye contact with Grandfather.

Nevertheless, the aunt's face was brimming with a smile. She had achieved her goal of not being kicked out because of her son.

“Father, does it suit your taste?”

“Yes, it tastes just like the chogye-tang from a famous restaurant.”

Of course, it would taste good since it seemed like it was made by a hotel chef and merely transferred to a different container.

As lunchtime was coming to an end, the aunt cautiously started a conversation.

“Father, did you know our Jinseok ranked first in his class this time? His mock exam scores were quite good too, and his homeroom teacher asked if he was considering going to medical school.”

“Really?”

“But you know, our Jinseok can't stand the sight of blood, just like me. So, I'm worried about what to do with him. Maybe it’s better for him to apply to the business school at Korea University?”

A passing dog would laugh at this. Anyone would think she was talking about a unique genius.

In his previous life, Yoo Jinseok was accused of fraud and had dropped out of college. He had even fled abroad to study before returning to Korea.

Even with a butterfly effect, could a student who doesn't study get into Korea University?

Sure enough, as the aunt's lies piled up, Yoo Jinseok's face grew increasingly uneasy.

“By the way, Hyun, are you studying hard? I often see you in newspapers and on the news as a violin prodigy, but you must also study well. You can't neglect your studies just because you're into the arts. Isn't it true that those who are poor at studying often turn to entertainment these days? I'll make sure to attend your next solo recital.”

Grandfather chuckled silently. It seemed he was at a loss for words.

Even in high school, I was among the top students. If I set my mind to it, becoming the top student would be nothing.

Moreover, attending my solo recital wasn't something anyone could just decide to do. All seats were sold out, and there were numerous requests to increase seating.

“Aunt, can I get some tutoring from Jinseok hyung today? I'm a bit weak in math, and I think learning from him would help me improve quickly.”

“What?”

At that moment, both the aunt and Yoo Jinseok showed signs of bewilderment.

* * *

“Hmm, how have you been?”

Yoo Jinseok, as if he had forgotten about the past, started joking around with me. It had already been three years, so it wasn't surprising.

After all, in his previous life, he was a fraudster. He must have learned to put on a thick skin from a young age.

“You want me to teach you math? It looks like hyung needs to show his skills after a long time.”

Feeling confident as I listened obediently, Yoo Jinseok came to life.

But surprisingly, even after placing the workbook on the desk, he couldn't start. Though the problem was difficult, his serious expression made it look like he was about to take a college entrance exam.

“Hey, you should ask your school teacher to teach you such complex problems. How can you ask me to teach you? By the way, is that your violin? The case looks quite worn out.”

He subtly changed the subject and approached the violin case set up in a corner of the room.

It was an old violin that my mother used to play when she was young.

“Don’t touch it.”

“What?”

“I said, don’t touch it.”

Yoo Jinseok, startled by my sudden informal speech, looked at me with wide eyes. But then, turning red with anger, he looked down at me.

Well, he was still much bigger than me. He was two years older, so it was only natural.

“You brat, you’ll soon be penniless. If my mom and Uncle Beomkyung hand over the company to those foreigners, you'll be like a dog chasing after a chicken―!”

“Hand over the company?”

What was he talking about?

Realizing he had made a mistake, Yoo Jinseok shut his mouth but his eyes still glowed with anger. He still hadn't gotten over the humiliation from his younger cousin when we were kids. But that didn’t matter.

Click.

I got up and locked the door. I had agreed to give math tutoring for at least an hour, so he had no choice but to stay in this room. I had also told the housekeeper that we didn’t need any snacks, so no one would come upstairs for a while.

Though Yoo Jinseok seemed briefly flustered, he soon regained his composure. Given the size difference, he probably thought he could easily win.

But there was one thing Yoo Jinseok didn’t know.

“Jinseok.”

I smoothly grabbed his shoulder with my left hand.

“It’s not that I couldn’t hit you back then.”

His eyes widened.

“It’s that I didn’t hit you.”

My remaining fist shot toward his abdomen like a bullet.

* * *

“Oh, Hyun, are you going to work today?”

I had become quite friendly with Kim Yeonji, who was sitting at the Seocho-dong headquarters desk. She now knew my work schedule at Daeil Group quite well.

Just then, Kim Yeonji looked at my neck with wide eyes.

“Hyun, are you hurt? Why are you wearing a band-aid?”

“The violin string suddenly broke. It's nothing serious.”

Who would have thought? He fainted from just one punch. When Yoo Jinseok fell backward, he scratched my neck with his nails, leaving a mark.

In my previous life, I often dealt with heinous criminals at the Western District Prosecutors' Office, so even as a prosecutor, I knew how to defend myself. I knew exactly how to hit someone to make them listen obediently without leaving visible bruises.

‘It's fortunate my right hand isn’t injured.’

It had been a while since I used my fist, so I was worried I might mess up. But Yoo Jinseok’s courage was even smaller than I had imagined.

There was no need to wake him up and hit him again. As soon as he saw my eyes, he spilled everything he knew. But then again.

‘Is history repeating itself?’

No, it might be that foreign corporate predators are eyeing Dongju because it remained strong during the financial crisis.

Among the many domestic companies that were like scarecrows, Dongju was one of the few solid ones.

Here’s what Yoo Jinseok told me.

‘Uncle and Aunt are trying to sell their shares in Dongju.’

An unknown foreign company had approached Uncle and Aunt, offering to buy their shares.

Having lost trust within Dongju, Uncle seemed to have given up and decided to sell Dongju as if channeling Yi Wan-yong, the notorious collaborator during the Japanese occupation.

“Hyun, are you going to work today?”

“No, I came to discuss something with Manager Kim.”

“By the way, thanks for your advice the other day. I made the necessary adjustments and submitted it well. Thank you.”

As soon as I entered the Strategic Planning Department, Deputy Oh Taeseok, my mentor, greeted me.

Since the heated debate in the meeting room with Team Leader Kim, Deputy Oh Taeseok seemed to trust me more. Other team members also had some trust in me. Here, I was no longer just a student.

I headed to Manager Kim Sang-guk’s office with urgent business.

“Manager Kim, did you find what I asked for?”

“Yes, it was quite a task, but just as you said, there is indeed a group trying to buy shares in Dongju. However, it’s shrouded in secrecy. I barely managed to find out the company name.”

There was no need for me, a child, to personally search for an unknown foreign company. During times like these, connections were essential.

Manager Kim Sang-guk was one of the most well-connected people in the country.

Manager Kim tapped his pen on a notepad and spoke.

“The company name is VH Company.”

* * *

What’s the use of worrying? No suitable solution was coming to mind.

I tried to find out more about VH Company, as Manager Kim Sang-guk had indicated, but there wasn’t much to dig up. It seemed to be a different entity from the foreign capital that absorbed Dongju in my previous life.

“Grandfather, are you asleep?”

Though it was late, Grandfather was reading a book in his study. He looked much healthier compared to my previous life, making it hard to believe he only had two years left.

Grandfather gently stroked my head.

“Grandfather, are you getting your regular health check-ups?”

“You rascal, the doctor told me I’d live to be a hundred. If I ever skip a health check-up, you’d nag more than your grandmother did.”

“You need to live a long, healthy life.”

“Grandfather Yooha also said he needs to see his grandchildren get married before he can rest.”

Just then, Grandfather noticed the silver ring on my finger and asked if it was the engagement ring I had matched with Yooha. What on earth had Yooha told Chairman Son?

Grandfather, in a stern tone, added that being a live-in son-in-law was out of the question.

But that wasn’t the important issue right now.

“Grandfather, did Aunt say anything?”

“Well, it’s the usual. She asked if, after Jinseok enters university, it would be a good idea for him to start learning the ropes at Dongju. It seems she’s bothered by you getting management lessons from Chairman Son.”

Aunt’s true intentions were hard to fathom. She was trying to ingratiate herself with Grandfather while secretly plotting with Uncle to sell the shares of Dongju that Grandfather had bequeathed to them.

I had made up my mind and looked at Grandfather.

“Grandfather, please don’t be surprised by what I’m about to say.”

“You rascal, just spit it out. I have a strong heart. Are you asking for an expensive violin?”

I wish it were as simple as that. I told Grandfather everything: what I had heard from Yoo Jinseok and what Manager Kim Sang-guk had found out.

What was the point of trying to solve it alone? It would be faster if Grandfather, the current owner of Dongju, took action. Then.

“You rascal, do you think your grandfather wouldn’t know that?”

“What?”

“Your uncle and aunt hold quite a bit of Dongju’s shares. No matter how hard I tried to reclaim them, those cunning kids wouldn’t easily give them up. So, I asked Chairman Son to help me set up a separate company. Do you know what VH in VH Company stands for? Think carefully.”

What was Grandfather talking about? With a mysterious smile, he stood up.

His next words felt like a bucket of cold water had been poured over my head.
