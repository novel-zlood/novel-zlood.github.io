Deokdeok.

If what Grandpa said is true, the message indicated by Chairman Wang refers to Teacher Deoksu Deoksu. Without hesitation, I asked Grandpa.

"Grandpa, where is Teacher Deoksu now?"

"I don't know."

"Pardon?"

Grandpa's face was clearly filled with sorrow.

"To begin with, I didn't believe in the existence of Teacher Deoksu."

"What do you mean?"

"According to Chairman Son, Teacher Deoksu's wisdom and insight were extraordinary. He helped build the foundation of Cheil Corporation from the ruins after the war. However, there were many things that I couldn't understand. If Chairman Son's words were true, Teacher Deoksu was a great merchant among merchants. It's hard to believe that someone like that never showed his face. At first, I thought Chairman Son was speaking metaphorically."

Grandpa's thoughts weren't unreasonable.

To the average person, Chairman Son Jangwon was a figure with unparalleled management skills and insight.

From the tumultuous era of the military regime after the Korean War to the millennium, Son Jangwon never lost the leading position in the business world.

If such a great person guided Son Jangwon, it indeed seemed strange that he was never exposed to the outside world.

"However, Chairman Son didn't care whether I believed him or not. When he got a bit drunk, he would occasionally talk about Teacher Deoksu. He said that he, a peddler from North Hamgyong Province, could become the head of such a large company thanks to Teacher Deoksu. Listening to the stories from Cheil Corporation, I realized how outstanding Teacher Deoksu was. One day, out of curiosity, I asked him if Teacher Deoksu was still alive."

Gulp.

"At that moment, Chairman Son answered very seriously that he was still alive. So, I came to believe that Teacher Deoksu was not a metaphorical figure but a real person. He said that whenever he faced difficulties, he would seek wisdom from Teacher Deoksu, thanks to whom he survived several times during the military regime. But he never revealed who or where Teacher Deoksu was. Chairman Son also emphasized that Teacher Deoksu extremely disliked being exposed to the outside world."

The more I listened, the more astonishing the story was. It was a secret not even mentioned in Chairman Wang's autobiography.

During the military regime, many companies fell like autumn leaves. Surely, the military regime must have touched Cheil Corporation too.

However, Cheil Corporation thrived by utilizing the military regime.

And it was because of someone called Teacher Deoksu behind it all.

"Hyun, aren't you curious?"

"About what?"

"About the extent of Teacher Deoksu's abilities. Chairman Son answered this question without hesitation."

Grandpa added firmly.

"If Teacher Deoksu had appeared in the business world with ambitions, the rankings in the business world would have changed."

* * *

Whirr, whirr, buzz buzz―!

As the cool breeze heralds the beginning of autumn, the last cicada's chirping echoes through the gray city.

Cheil Gallery is eerily quiet as if it has closed.

Kim Sangguk's face was filled with curiosity as he entered the gallery due to the sudden call.

"Director, I'm sorry to call you when you have to go on a business trip to Austria. It's an urgent matter."

"It's okay. If the CEO calls, I must go wherever he needs me."

"Director, do you know someone named Teacher Deoksu?"

It was a faint hope. Director Kim Sangguk was the head of the strategic planning office, the core of Cheil Group.

He was one of the people who knew most of Cheil Group's secrets after Chairman Wang and President Son Ilseon.

Director Kim Sangguk furrowed his brows, seemed to ponder, then shook his head.

"I've never heard of that name."

As expected, Director Kim Sangguk also didn't know him. After all, even Grandpa had never seen him in person.

"Director, I'm sorry, but could you postpone the business trip and find Teacher Deoksu?"

"Teacher Deoksu?"

"The clues are few. He helped Chairman Son after the Korean War at Cheil Corporation and is likely a centenarian by now."

Director Kim Sangguk furrowed his brows again. It was only natural. It was like finding a needle in a haystack.

But Director Kim Sangguk soon nodded vigorously.

"Understood. I will do my best to find him."

At that moment.

Knock, knock.

There was an unexpected knock from outside the studio.

"Hyun, you have a visitor."

"A visitor?"

Kim Mihyun's face was filled with tension. It was unusual for her.

I soon understood her tension as a figure appeared behind Kim Mihyun.

"Hyun, I dropped by because I was bored!"

It was Son Gangwook. In his large hands, he held a box of Bacchus energy drinks, seemingly bought from a local supermarket.

"You must be tired from working on music. Drink this. It's a small token of my appreciation. Hahaha!"

Given that he was a chaebol heir, it wouldn't have been surprising if a wad of cash came out of the Bacchus box, but it was really just caffeinated drinks.

Son Gangwook's face was like that of a kind-hearted farmer, just as before.

"I came to see my sister-in-law, but it seems she didn't come to work because she didn't want to see me. I decided to drop by and see you, Hyun, but it looks like you have a guest who arrived before me."

"Ah, let me introduce you. This is—"

"I know. You're Director Kim Sangguk of the strategic planning office, right? I heard you moved to VH Company. This is the first time I'm meeting you in person. Please have a Bacchus drink too, Director. Hahaha."

For a brief moment, Director Kim Sangguk's face turned pale. It was only natural because he never imagined that Son Gangwook knew his identity. The members of the strategic planning office were all highly confidential.

While drinking the beverage and catching his breath, Son Gangwook looked at me intently.

"I really like you, Hyun. I'd love to scout you, but since you've already achieved great success in both music and the investment industry, I can't make any rash moves. I wanted to have a deep conversation today, but since you have other guests, I'll just leave after making my presence known."

At that moment, I noticed men in black suits carrying out a painting from beyond the door.

When I saw the painting, my eyes widened.

It was simple. It was the "Shadow in the Storm" that had been displayed in the gallery's lobby. Moreover, those men were Son Gangwook's subordinates.

"This is the 'Shadow in the Storm' that you introduced to me before, Hyun."

"Why is that painting...?"

"Oh, I received it as a gift from my sister-in-law. In exchange for taking it easy on my brother, I was allowed to take one painting from the gallery. I need to make things mine one by one."

Son Gangwook stood up and looked at me. At that moment, his eyes gleamed like those of a tiger.

"See you next time, Hyun."

After Son Gangwook left the studio, Director Kim Sangguk exhaled the breath he had been holding. His face was drenched in cold sweat as if he had been caught in a heavy downpour.

* * *

"Hyun, are you upset about something?"

Kim Daewoo looked at me with a worried expression.

"Huh?"

"Well, your face looks so stern. Anyone would think you just had a fight. The kids are too scared to come near you."

I must have unconsciously shown a habit from my previous life. How many cases had I handled as a prosecutor at the Western District Prosecutor's Office? When my worries deepened, a fierce aura would unconsciously seep into my eyes.

My head was filled with thoughts about Son Gangwook.

Tsk.

I shook my head to clear my thoughts. My mouth tasted bitter.

The news was filled with stories about Cheil Group's President Son Ilseon every day. Some even said that the prosecution had completely severed ties with Cheil Group.

‘Foolish talk.’

I had spent my entire past life in the prosecution.

The term "collusion between politics and business" didn't come about for nothing. The current prosecution hadn't severed ties with Cheil Group but had rather severed ties with President Son Ilseon.

It was evidence that Son Gangwook's influence had reached deep into the prosecution.

‘If things continue like this, the future will really change.’

Son Gangwook's path was unrelenting. He was moving beneath the surface and even exerting influence over Cheil Gallery. Surely, he had already reached out to many executives within Cheil Group.

The current situation, with President Son Ilseon in custody, was the perfect opportunity for him.

"Hyun, did you study for the pop quiz?"

"Pop quiz?"

"Yeah, dude. We have a pop quiz in the law elective this time. I don't know why the professor likes quizzes so much. But you didn't know?"

Seeing my puzzled expression, Kim Daewoo looked shocked.

I must have been so busy lately that I even forgot about the pop quiz.

But it was a law elective, wasn't it? Having lived as a legal professional for many years, I was confident I could answer any legal problem that came up.

At that moment.

Phone?

My cell phone rang unexpectedly. Seeing the caller's name, I immediately brought the phone to my ear.

"Yes, Director."

How much time had passed?

"Daewoo, I don't think I can attend class today."

"What? Dude, there's a pop quiz today."

"That's not important right now."

Kim Daewoo looked bewildered. There was no time to explain further. I immediately took out my car keys and sprinted toward the parking lot where my car was parked.

The reason I was moving so urgently was simple. Director Kim Sangguk had found Teacher Deoksu!

* * *

Tension filled the grand mansion in Pyeongchang-dong. Not only the housekeeper but also the security guards had tense expressions on their faces.

A man was leisurely walking beyond the garden adorned with various ornamental trees.

He was tall with a sturdy build, and his deep eyes beneath thick eyebrows resembled those of Chairman Wang.

"Sister-in-law, did you see a ghost?"

Son Gangwook greeted Director Im Hyera with a faint smile.

It was a situation on the brink of explosion, but Son Gangwook's face remained relaxed.

"It’s been years since I last visited the Pyeongchang-dong mansion. It hasn't changed at all. Father still likes old things. You must have a hard time matching his temperament, sister-in-law. By the way, you're working hard acting as the head in place of my brother."

Director Im Hyera didn't respond to Son Gangwook's words. It was an obvious provocation.

Whether she answered or not, Son Gangwook continued walking without concern.

"I'll just go see my father for a moment."

She wanted to kick Son Gangwook out of the Pyeongchang-dong mansion right away, but she couldn't. With one word from him, even the Cheil Foundation would be in danger.

Son Gangwook walked unhesitatingly toward Chairman Wang's bedroom like he owned the place.

Beep beep beep beep.

The sound of machines checking the vital signs filled the bedroom.

Chairman Wang lay on the bed as if he were in a deep sleep.

Looking down at Chairman Wang, Son Gangwook spoke.

"Father, your second son is here."

Still, there was no response from Chairman Wang.

"I gave our third brother, Hongwon, a stern lesson. He won't cause you any more trouble. Oh, and our eldest brother, Ilseon, is currently detained by the prosecution. It seems his secret wrongdoings have finally caught up with him. Hahaha. But he's a cunning guy, so he won't stay behind bars for long."

Beep beep beep beep.

"You’re usually so quick to anger, but seeing you like this makes me uneasy. Please recover quickly and wake up. I need to show you."

At that moment, Son Gangwook looked at Chairman Wang with tiger-like eyes and spoke.

"I need to show you me sitting in the chairman's seat."
