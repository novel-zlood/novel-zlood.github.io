[100 People Leading the 21st Century Chosen by TIME]

[Hollywood’s Maestro James Cameron Wants ‘Hyun’.]

[Marvel Comics Honorary President Stan Lee Sparks Interest with His Statement: “I Want to Create a Character Modeled After Violinist Hyun!”]

Baek Jeonghoon clicked his tongue as he read about Kang Hyun filling up a New York weekly magazine.

It was extremely rare for an Asian to become such a sensation in America.

There had been a negative reaction in the past with John Lennon’s Yoko Ono, who was said to have hastened the Beatles’ breakup, but Kang Hyun was different.

Not only had he sparked a classical boom among American teenagers, but he had also caused a significant stir among the movie and broadcast industry stakeholders.

There were even rumors that major American agencies and labels were moving huge sums of money to scout Kang Hyun.

“Hyuna, at this rate, you might become the first Korean to top the Billboard Singles Chart.”

Just a few years ago, this would have been dismissed as a joke, but things were different now.

Kang Hyun’s orchestral symphony, Gang Hyun Symphony No.1, not only broke into the top 10 of the Billboard charts but was steadily climbing higher.

Moreover, other tracks from the album were also rapidly rising in the charts over time.

This unprecedented phenomenon in the American music industry was being termed the ‘Hyun Syndrome.’

“Don’t even say that; I’m already losing my mind. I’m planning to return to Korea after finishing my work with the New York Philharmonic. If I stay abroad any longer, I might get sick from all the paparazzi and journalists.”

Of course, the paparazzi and journalists weren’t the only reasons. Lately, even people from Wall Street had been seeking him out.

This was after rumors had spread about a big hand moving Chairman Barbara Tannenbaum.

“Other musicians would be tempted by the thought of topping the Billboard chart, but sometimes I think you’re truly enlightened, Hyun.”

Achieving the number one spot on the Billboard chart would bring not only honor but also immense wealth. Many had already proposed world tours to Kang Hyun. If Kang Hyun had been more materialistic, he might have become the youngest billionaire.

‘I already have enough money.’

Kang Hyun thought to himself, listening to Baek Jeonghoon. Thanks to the diligent manager Kim Sangguk of VH Company.

He executed every instruction without the slightest error. Watching the global investments he had sown bloom was enough to fill his heart.

“I don’t care about money. I have enough to live on for the rest of my life without working.”

“Yeah, with your royalties and composition fees alone, you’re making more than most companies…….”

From Baek Jeonghoon’s perspective, who didn’t know about VH Company, he was only considering the music royalties.

Kang Hyun didn’t bother to correct Baek Jeonghoon’s misunderstanding.

Baek Jeonghoon marveled again as he looked around Kang Hyun’s studio.

Having seen countless musicians’ studios, he could confidently say that Kang Hyun’s was among the top three.

In the heart of expensive New York, his spacious studio was equipped with top-grade modern electronic instruments and orchestral instruments.

“The CEO must really think highly of you, Hyun. To support you to this extent.”

“Hyung, don’t be upset. The CEO provided the place, but I personally prepared all the equipment and instruments in the studio. Hyung, are you just going to stand there? Now that all the scheduled concerts are over. Aren’t you returning to Korea in a week?”

“Yes, but what does that have to do with me returning in a week?”

Baek Jeonghoon planned to return to Korea after finishing his month-long concert series in New York. Why was there a lack of time? A week should be more than enough to unwind with Kang Hyun.

Kang Hyun motioned toward the piano with his eyes and said.

“What are you waiting for? Sit down.”

Yes. A week was plenty of time to teach Baek Jeonghoon a new score.

“It’s troublesome if you become too famous…….”

Antonio, the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic, couldn’t hide his regret as he read the TIME magazine article.

Kang Hyun’s popularity was growing day by day.

Antonio, who had been called a prodigy since childhood and had gone through various minor European orchestras to become the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic, had seen many geniuses, but none as extraordinary as Kang Hyun.

Moreover, in America, where commercial music is popular, a classical star receiving such public attention was unimaginable even in dreams.

“Will he accept the performance?”

It was a consensus among the maestro, the concertmaster, and the members of the New York Philharmonic. They wanted to perform with Kang Hyun, not just for a one-off collaboration.

However, Antonio knew Kang Hyun’s personality better than anyone from the time they spent together.

Kang Hyun was the type who despised anything troublesome. No matter who came, if it wasn’t something he wanted, he wouldn’t do it.

Despite his young age, conversations with him sometimes felt like talking to a maestro. He was that hard to read.

- Antonio, how about having Hyun as a judge for this audition?

It was a suggestion from the maestro who had temporarily left New York for a sabbatical.

Coincidentally, the New York Philharmonic was recruiting new members for the second violin part.

Selecting members for the second violin part was entirely Antonio’s authority.

However, in the history of the New York Philharmonic, there had never been a non-affiliate sitting on the judging panel for an audition.

- Antonio, you don’t understand. The conductor that both the London Symphony and the Berlin Philharmonic desperately wanted was Hyun. Their musical pride is sky-high, yet they welcomed the young Asian Hyun with open arms. Didn’t Spencer of the London Symphony openly declare Hyun as his protégé?

When Maestro Spencer of the London Symphony expressed his immense interest in Kang Hyun, some were skeptical.

But in hindsight, it was incredible foresight. Even the legendary Maestro Karas showed significant interest in Kang Hyun.

- With the current media focus on Hyun, he’ll likely want to return to Korea soon. At times like this, we need to show our strong trust in him. Proposing that he be a judge for the New York Philharmonic auditions is a testament to our trust in him. Think carefully, Antonio. Hyun’s value is rising day by day.

Antonio recalled the maestro’s words.

- In the future, just having collaborated with Hyun could be a significant mark in classical music history!

“Audition?”

Kang Hyun tilted his head at the unexpected proposal.

It was for the New York Philharmonic’s second violin part auditions. Typically, orchestra auditions were overseen by the chief conductor, music director, and concertmaster.

Wasn’t it impossible for anyone outside the orchestra to be involved?

“I’ll get straight to the point. The New York Philharmonic wants to perform with you, Mr. Hyun.”

“Antonio, aren’t we already collaborating?”

“We want a regular performance, not just a one-off. The members also acknowledge you. Even Sergey, who initially doubted you, would now follow your lead unquestionably.”

Antonio, usually talkative, looked more serious than usual. It showed how desperately he needed Kang Hyun.

‘So that’s why they want me as a judge for the auditions.’

Kang Hyun quickly grasped Antonio’s intention. Entrusting a non-affiliate with the judging panel could raise external issues.

But offering this to Kang Hyun despite potential issues was a testament to their trust in his skill and reputation.

‘Hmm.’

Seeing Kang Hyun’s contemplative expression, Antonio’s face brightened.

Im Hyera, the CEO, had been lamenting a lot lately. She mentioned that inquiries about concerts in New York were flooding in daily.

“Antonio, I’ll consider it positively. However, if I take the baton, the practice intensity will be much higher than last time. There’s limited time to practice the repertoire.”

Antonio nodded without hesitation. The members, initially struggling with Kang Hyun’s strict methods, had grown accustomed to his conducting and even desired it.

After all, they felt their skills improving under Kang Hyun’s guidance.

“Hyun, let me guide you.”

Antonio led the way to the audition hall, and Kang Hyun reluctantly followed.

It was a small audition hall in the annex of the New York Philharmonic’s concert hall.

Since it was specifically for recruiting new members for the second violin part, the assistant concertmaster had arrived early.

Seeing Antonio’s signal, he couldn’t hide his joyful smile.

Then, he greeted Kang Hyun as if he were facing a maestro.

“Antonio, you want me to sit at the head of the table?”

Initially, the burden made him refuse, but Antonio and the assistant concertmaster’s earnest persuasion left him no choice.

Feeling somewhat trapped, he took his seat at the head of the table with the other orchestra members.

“Call in the first applicant.”

As soon as the coordinator spoke, Antonio and the assistant concertmaster’s expressions changed.

The New York Philharmonic’s reputation is second to none. Talented individuals from minor European and American orchestras awaited this day to audition.

But no matter how skilled, no one could be sure of securing a position.

Huh?

Kang Hyun was startled to see a familiar name on the first applicant’s resume.

Soon, a cautious East Asian woman entered the audition hall, her face tense with nervousness.

But upon seeing Kang Hyun at the head of the table, her eyes widened in surprise.

Park Sunyoung?
