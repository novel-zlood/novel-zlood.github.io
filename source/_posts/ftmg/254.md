There are several nicknames for Director Kim Sang-guk of VH Company. Some call him the "Kwak Fu-shing of Yeouido" because he resembles a Hong Kong movie star, while others refer to him as the "King of Investment" or the "God of Investment," and he is even idolized by stockbrokers.

His career was also illustrious. He once led the strategic planning office, which only those directly selected by Chairman Wang could enter, among the scholarship students of the Cheil Group.

Externally, the investment case involving an Austrian pharmaceutical company was also evaluated as a testament to his abilities.

Because of this, he had already become a living legend in Yeouido.

"Director, the coffee doesn't taste very good."

"The chairman came, so I made the Luwak coffee myself, and you say it's not good?"

"You could have just given me a packet of coffee. Why did you bother making such expensive coffee? And from now on, Luwak coffee is banned in the company. It's all about cat abuse."

"Ahem, it was a gift..."

To an outsider, it was a bizarre sight. Director Kim Sang-guk, with his sharp eyes and angular jaw, was flustered in front of a young man who looked like a college student.

"Let's take a look at the investment proposals for Japan and Hong Kong first."

"Aren't you going to take a tour of the company?"

"All companies are the same. And if I walk around, the department staff will find it strange. It's much more comfortable for me to remain an invisible representative."

Director Kim Sang-guk handed over the investment proposal to Kang Hyun with a tense expression.

Kang Hyun, after removing his hat, looked incredibly handsome. Moreover, the sight of him reading the investment proposal with melancholy eyes was like a scene from a movie.

"Whose idea is it to target the Japanese display market?"

"It's the opinion of Manager Kim Ji-wook from the Investment Team 2."

"It's not a bad idea, but it's premature. I think it's too late to get on board now. It's better to target other fields. Especially since Japan's consumer culture and market direction have changed drastically from the 20th to the 21st century. Japan's national bonds will increasingly lose their appeal. The Hong Kong proposal is your idea, right?"

"That's correct."

"It's not bad. Our VH Company should target not only Hong Kong but especially Chinese stocks. They may not be popular in the market now, but they have strong potential. And..."

Kang Hyun continued to give advice on the investment proposal. Director Kim Sang-guk listened attentively.

'What exactly is his secret?'

Kang Hyun had an insight like someone who could see the future.

Drawing the big picture isn't easy. Even more so, Kang Hyun's investment strategy, which foresaw even the smallest details, left Director Kim Sang-guk in awe.

He had long known that Kang Hyun had an exceptional talent for reading the global stock market, but it was a continuous series of surprises.

'I understand why he moved Chairman Barbara.'

There were already widespread rumors on Wall Street that Kang Hyun was the big hand who moved Barbara Tannenbaum.

Those who knew Kang Hyun only as a musician thought it was an exaggerated rumor, but Director Kim Sang-guk was different.

Even Director Kim Sang-guk, who had experienced all sorts of ups and downs in the Cheil Group's strategic planning office, was so mesmerized. Barbara Tannenbaum must have felt the same way.

Thinking about it,

'Chairman Wang's insight is truly remarkable.'

Even when Kang Hyun was just a middle school student, Chairman Wang showed immense interest in him. He was indeed a giant in the Korean business world. He instantly recognized the potential in Kang Hyun to become great.

Considering that 21-year-old Kang Hyun was already at this level, it was impossible to predict how he would grow as he aged. It felt like looking up at an endless ancient tree.

"Director, are you listening?"

"Yes, yes. I'm listening."

"Please provide full support within reasonable limits for the conditions desired by Austria Dream. They have the potential to surpass Calvin Pharmaceuticals. By the way, I heard you went on a blind date recently?"

"Excuse me?"

Director Kim Sang-guk almost spit out his coffee. How did Kang Hyun know he went on a blind date?

"I heard it from Chairman Wang. We played Go together a few days ago. I heard you went on a date with the eldest daughter of Supreme Court Chief Justice Han Deuk-hyung."

"Ahem, that's correct."

"You didn't like her, did you?"

"Junior, no, Representative, how did you know?"

Kang Hyun smiled slightly. He knew Supreme Court Chief Justice Han Deuk-hyung well. Despite his position, he was known for his fiery temper.

Moreover, in his later years, his eldest daughter made headlines by assaulting a police officer at an accident scene while driving under the influence.

When Kang Hyun first entered the Judicial Research and Training Institute, there was even a wave of public opinion calling for the impeachment of the Chief Justice.

"Chairman Wang is probably pushing for a strategic marriage for your future, but if you don't feel like it, you don't have to do it. You've been out of the strategic planning office for quite some time now. Ultimately, what's important is your feelings. Your right match will come naturally, like fate."

Kang Hyun predicted Director Kim Sang-guk's future like a fortune teller. He knew who Director Kim Sang-guk, who later became Prime Minister, married.

Director Kim Sang-guk, once called the elite of elites, eventually married a classmate from elementary school who had lived a lonely life after losing her parents early. This made him known as a romanticist in the political world.

"Well, I've seen how you're doing, so I should get going."

"Representative, are you leaving so soon?"

"If I stay here longer, the other employees will just get tired."

As Kang Hyun stood up, Director Kim Sang-guk asked a question he had been holding back.

"Representative, can I really believe that my match will come like fate?"

"Fate is nothing special. There's a saying that a brush of the sleeve is also fate. Maybe you've already met them. Isn't there someone who makes you feel comfortable just by looking at them?"

Director Kim Sang-guk tilted his head. Not believing in fate, Kang Hyun's words seemed nonsensical to him.

But someone who made him feel comfortable, someone did come to mind. Just like Kang Hyun said, someone who made him feel at ease just by looking at them.

In Brussels, Belgium, mail filled with the aspirations of young violinists from around the world arrived.

The prestige of the Queen Elisabeth Competition was immense. It was hailed as one of the world's top three competitions and had become a national event.

Moreover, due to the postponement of last year's competition, this year's event was expected to have the highest number of participants in history.

"Is it true that Violinist Hyun is really coming as a judge?"

Eva couldn't hide her surprise. Seven years ago, she had personally welcomed Violinist Hyun along with Russian maestro Alexei.

At that time, it was unimaginable that such a small boy would dominate the Queen Elisabeth Competition.

"This year's competition is going to be incredible."

It wasn't just Violinist Hyun's attendance that was making headlines. Even Hirose, the Japanese maestro who had never appeared at any competition, was attending.

Moreover, promising young violinists from around the world were eagerly applying.

'The dark horses are incredible.'

It was a gathering of young violinists whose names were already well-known. Many of them had already won other international competitions.

The reason they were so fixated on the Queen Elisabeth Competition was simple. Chapelle, the sanctuary for violinists, was the stage of their dreams.

"Oh?"

At that moment, Eva's eyes were drawn to a recommendation letter. Among the recommendation letters from renowned maestros around the world, two letters stood out.

As if recalling past memories, Eva picked up the recommendation letters. One was stamped by the president of the Royal Academy of Music, and the other bore the stamp of Spencer, the pride of the London Symphony Orchestra.

It was the first time since seven years ago that Spencer had recommended someone. But the name of the young violinist mentioned in the recommendation letter was unfamiliar.

"Sabrina?"

* * *

"Maestro, is there anything you're uncomfortable with?"

"How could I be uncomfortable? Thank you for treating me so well."

Kang Hyun felt a bit of pressure on the flight to Belgium. Not only the flight attendants but even the purser and the captain revealed themselves to be fans of Kang Hyun and treated him warmly.

They were so kind that if Kang Hyun showed any displeasure while eating the in-flight meal, they offered to prepare it again, and if he even slightly coughed, they immediately brought him cold medicine and a blanket. He thought he should probably give them his autograph before he got off the plane.

Fortunately, since the Queen Elisabeth Competition provided a first-class ticket, he had little interaction with other passengers.

"Oh? The model for Daesun Airlines has changed?"

On the cover of the airline magazine was a familiar face smiling. The flight attendant, hearing Kang Hyun's question, answered with a proud expression.

"Yes, Maestro Baek Jung-hoon shot the model this year."

"It's a bit unfamiliar because of the uniform."

There is a saying that clothes make the man. With his tall stature and broad shoulders, Baek Jung-hoon looked good even in uniform.

Normally, a famous celebrity would have been chosen as the model, but perhaps due to Kang Hyun's influence, there was a classical music boom in the country.

Moreover, did Kang Hyun know? The first model proposal from Daesun Airlines was actually made to him.

Disliking troublesome things, he had rejected all CF and corporate model offers, which led to this outcome.

"Maestro, we hope you will continue to use Daesun Airlines. We, the flight attendants and I, will always support you from the sky."

That sounds a bit strange. But the flight attendants' eyes were filled with excessive admiration.

In a way, it was understandable. News praising Kang Hyun was being reported daily in the country.

Under the pretext of national prestige, he was already being mentioned alongside sports stars like Park Chan-ho and Park Se-ri.

As Kang Hyun, accompanied by bodyguards, exited the gate, he saw a familiar figure.

"Teacher!"

It was Hirose, known as the Queen of Violin. Her white hair stood out even from a distance.

Moreover, even standing casually, she exuded an aura as if she were on stage. She was the violinist who best embodied the term virtuoso.

At that moment,

'What is this?'

Kang Hyun suddenly recalled a memory from seven years ago. It was because of the middle-aged man standing crookedly next to Hirose. He resembled the Russian maestro Alexei but was younger and had a more hooked nose.

Moreover, his eyebrows were long like an owl's. His deep smile lines made him look like a grumpy person.

But you can't judge a person by their first impression.

"Teacher, it's an honor to see you again."

"Hyun, it's been a long time. You've become much more handsome than before. You've grown a lot taller too. And this person next to me is..."

Before Hirose could finish speaking, the Russian Viktor greeted him with a gruff tone.

"Don't you know me? I'm Viktor."
