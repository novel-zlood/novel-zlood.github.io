"Old man, what do you think about the engagement?"

Marriage is often considered a significant event in one's life. In wealthy families, marriage is taken so seriously that it’s referred to as a "hundred-year plan."

"These days, matchmakers say that Ichondong is popular, right?"

"What do you mean?"

"They say there's never a day when footsteps stop along the stone wall road in Ichondong."

Indeed, after his solo recital, Kang Hyun's popularity was skyrocketing.

Though Hyun was a bit young to be the subject of matchmaking by matchmakers, strategic marriages were not uncommon. As the saying goes, "Birds of a feather flock together."

Even in these turbulent times, Hyun was more than fulfilling his role, making him a highly desirable groom.

"Don't say unnecessary things. Hyun is already troubled by trivial phone calls these days. He’s even getting contacted by mail. It wasn’t this bad when I was arranging marriages for Beomjin and Beomkyung."

"Hmph, these people must be out of their minds, trying to snatch what Son Jangwon has marked."

"Son family, if someone hears, they might think Hyun is a commodity."

"That’s not what I meant, in-laws. Are we going to act like this between us?"

Chairman Wang furrowed his brows as if feeling wronged.

"Instead of that, take a look at these. These are the photos I’ve collected this time."

"Did you take more?"

"Of course! I have to take them whenever I have the chance. Who knows when Yooha will come back to Korea? You know how fast children grow up."

A thick album was placed on the table in the reception room. While it wasn’t completely filled, the front pages were quite full.

The children in the photos were shining brightly. Among them, the picture of the two of them arm in arm particularly dazzled the grandfathers.

"By the way, where is Hyun? Wasn't today the day for the Go game?"

"The Go class was postponed. I thought it would be good for Hyun to gain field experience at Dongju, but it seems he has talents not just in the field of chemistry but in various areas. And we have a pretty good teacher."

"Teacher?"

Chairman Wang nodded with a mysterious smile.

Suddenly, the English novel "Big Brother" came to mind. It was a book I enjoyed reading as a child.

The protagonist makes a wish on a falling star and suddenly becomes an adult. The novel depicts various happenings as the grown-up protagonist joins a toy company, continually getting promoted and even finding love through business plans drawn with a child's innocence.

But reality isn't like a novel or a comic.

"Please take care of it until I return, Manager Choi."

Manager Choi felt like a nanny. It was understandable, given he was guiding a teenage boy who just entered high school through the company.

Had it not been for Director Kim Sang-guk's order from the Strategic Planning Office, he would have immediately called security to kick him out. However...

"Your name is Hyun, right?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Manager Choi felt puzzled by Kang Hyun’s prim demeanor. Was it because he was still a child, or was he just fearless?

Moreover, he walked with confidence, behaving adeptly as if he had worked in the company numerous times before. He even naturally got himself a coffee from the vending machine.

"Would you like your coffee black, Manager?"

"Oh, yes. Thank you."

"Am I being a bother? Usually, new employees aren’t given such a thorough tour."

What was this adept social skill? As Hyun mentioned, maybe it was overprotection.

Who would give a new employee a comprehensive tour of the company? In most cases, they learn by being yelled at by their mentor and gradually picking up tasks.

"Which department are you in, Manager? It doesn’t seem like the Strategic Planning Office, maybe the Education Department?"

"How did you know?"

"I could tell from your demeanor and speech. HRD trainers often have a similar vibe."

Was he Sherlock or something? Manager Choi was dumbfounded. It wasn’t just that this young teen guessed his job, but he also used corporate training jargon.

"Shall we go then? I think we've seen almost everything."

Hyun led the way, and Manager Choi followed. They arrived at an office set aside at the corner of the Education Department.

The Strategic Planning Office was not a place one could enter casually, so they had to stay there until Director Kim Sang-guk finished his meeting.

"Director Kim said you should look at this until he arrives."

It was a pile of documents. Though Manager Choi had glanced at them, he couldn’t make heads or tails of the content.

However, Hyun nodded as soon as he received the documents. He soon picked up a red pen lying around the office and sat down.

He looked so serious that Manager Choi quietly left the office without a word.

* * *

Click—! Click.

What a pleasant sound. To think I’d be tested on the first day. Habitually flipping through the pages, I marked them with the red pen.

It was a report predicting the future growth potential of foreign corporations. It was an extension of the debate we had in the conference room before.

Director Kim Sang-guk seemed to want to verify whether I was the real deal. However,

"Maybe I should make a few mistakes?"

There was no need for perfection. After all, I was here to learn.

Halfway through the stack of documents, I capped the pen. I was curious about the capabilities of Director Kim Sang-guk, who would later secure a solid position in the Blue House. Just then,

"Hyun, Director Kim is calling for you. Let’s go."

I gathered the documents and followed Manager Choi.

A familiar face welcomed me. He was the education manager of Jeil Group who had been in charge of leadership training for executives in my past life. Whether middle-aged or young, one commonality was that he was good at aligning himself with the right people.

Of course, it was understandable given that he had survived in the corporate jungle.

"Manager Choi, everyone’s eyes seem quite intense, huh?"

It seemed to be Manager Choi's first time in the Strategic Planning Office. His shoulders and neck were stiff with tension. I even worried he might develop a stiff neck from the strain.

Though I intended to ease his tension, it seemed to make him even more rigid.

Of course, it was understandable given that the Strategic Planning Office was filled with seasoned veterans.

"Thank you, Manager Choi."

"No problem, feel free to ask if you need anything in the future."

One might mistake him for a junior staff member of the Strategic Planning Office. Manager Choi exaggeratedly bowed his head and walked away.

Without further ado, I handed the stack of documents to Director Kim Sang-guk.

"Hmm."

As Director Kim flipped through the pages, his eyes gradually widened. However, when he noticed there were no more checked marks halfway through, he looked puzzled.

"Your name is Hyun, right?"

"Yes, Director."

"Did you make mistakes on purpose? Or do you really not know?"

Director Kim looked me straight in the eye and added,

"It seems to me that you know."

New employees always face a dilemma.

When encountering unfamiliar tasks, they wonder whether to ask questions and, if so, how to ask them.

After much contemplation, when they finally ask how to proceed, their senior responds with a look of disdain.

They ask if the new employee is a child and why, as an adult, they can’t handle their tasks proactively.

In that sense, the Strategic Planning Office was composed of proactive employees.

"Veterans are indeed veterans."

Everyone was experienced, and their work speed was like watching the stock market floor in Yeouido just before closing. The saying "quicker hands than eyes" held true.

You ask what exactly the Strategic Planning Office does?

In simple terms, it functions like a gatekeeper. It controls and decides the direction of the vast flow of funds within Jeil Group. However,

"That’s not right."

I glanced at the report in Assistant Manager Oh Tae-seok’s hands.

He had put a lot of effort into the report, but it was clearly off. I heard he was from BOA, and it was evident he wasn’t well-versed in the domestic market.

"Do you have any questions? If you're thirsty, go get an orange juice from the break room. If you're bored, ask Manager Choi in the Education Department to give you another tour."

Assistant Manager Oh’s face showed clear discomfort. Understandably, he had been excited about the arrival of a new junior but ended up playing nanny.

He couldn’t treat me harshly either. I had previously visited the Strategic Planning Office with President Son Il-seon. Rumors even circulated that I was the prospective son-in-law of Jeil Group.

"Okay, then I’ll have some juice."

"What?"

What use would it be to point out the mistakes? Moreover, I wasn’t planning on tiptoeing around the Strategic Planning Office like a rookie. In terms of tenure within Jeil Group, my experience was at least comparable to, if not greater than, theirs.

"This place is still barren."

I got a cup of milk coffee from the vending machine and went up to the rooftop. In the future, a garden would be built on this cement floor. People walking below the skyscraper would look like ants.

Boring as it was, there was nothing else to do. The old man had been considerate enough.

Assigning work to a student was absurd to begin with. Moreover, I had no intention of working.

"Huff, huff."

While sipping my coffee and passing the time, Assistant Manager Oh Tae-seok, drenched in sweat, burst onto the rooftop.

"How could you be up here without saying anything? I’ve been searching for you from the first floor, nearly dying of panic."

"You told me to kill time."

Assistant Manager Oh looked exasperated. He probably never imagined I’d be lying on the rooftop bench.

Still, he seemed quite worried. He must have feared a scolding from Director Kim Sang-guk.

"Recheck your report, Assistant Manager Oh."

"What?"

That should do it. I mentioned it in passing, and Assistant Manager Oh looked incredulous. Understandably, anyone would be.

However, after submitting and having his report rejected, he would remember my words.

"Isn’t it time for a meeting?"

"Oh, yes."

"Then let’s go down."

Assistant Manager Oh led the way, and I followed behind. After all, I was a mere tagalong in the Strategic Planning Office. Thanks to that, I could attend even the planning meetings.

Of course, it was absurd. A high school student attending internal meetings of the Strategic Planning Office, the brain of Jeil Group. But what could be done? Orders were orders.

Moreover, most people treated me as if I didn’t exist.

"Assistant Manager Oh, you finally found him."

When we arrived at the meeting room, sharp gazes were directed at me. Technically, I had left my post during working hours.

So what? They didn’t assign me any reports anyway. Just then,

"The person to lead the meeting has finally arrived."

"Pardon?"

"Everyone, take a look. Hyun is the one behind this report."

At that moment, Director Kim Sang-guk held up the stack of documents. It was the investment report I had previously debated with President Son Il-seon.

It seemed he had heard about the report from Chairman Wang.

"Let’s see how our new recruit persuades us."

Director Kim’s face was filled with curiosity and amusement. Understandably, it was hard to believe that a young student had produced the report.

As I stood up, I heard murmurs around me.

Indeed, both Director Kim and Chairman Wang had overlooked one thing: I was not lacking in practical experience.
