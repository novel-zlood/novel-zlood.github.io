"Old man, what do you think about the engagement?"

It is often said that marriage is a major event in life. Moreover, in a chaebol family, marriage is considered so important that it is referred to as a hundred-year plan.

"These days, matchmakers say Ichon-dong is popular, right?"

"What do you mean by that?"

"They say there's not a day when footsteps are absent on the stone wall road in Ichon-dong."

Of course, after Kang Hyun's solo performance, his popularity was skyrocketing.

Although Kang Hyun was young to be a target for matchmakers, arranged marriages weren't just for show. There's a saying that people of the same kind marry each other.

Moreover, even in these tumultuous times, Dongju was managing his share efficiently. What better groom could there be?

"Don't say such needless things. Hyunja is already troubled by the worthless calls recently. To the extent that people are contacting us by mail. Even when I married off my sons, Beomjin and Beomkyung, it wasn't this bad."

"Ahem, these people must have some nerve. Trying to snatch away what Son Jangwon has marked."

"If someone heard, they'd think Hyun is an object."

"That's not what I meant, in-law. Are we really going to do this between us?"

Chairman Wang furrowed his brows as if he was the one being wronged.

"Let's not do that. Take a look at this. These are the photos I've collected this time."

"Did you take more?"

"Of course! I have to take them whenever I get the chance. Who knows when Yooha will come back to Korea? You know, kids grow up so quickly."

A thick album was placed on the table in the reception room. Although it wasn't completely filled, the front part was quite full.

The children in the photos sparkled. Among them, the photo of the two linking arms particularly dazzled the grandfathers' eyes.

"By the way, where is Hyun? Isn't today the day for the Go lesson?"

"I've postponed the Go lesson for a while. I was thinking of letting Hyun gain some field experience at Dongju, but with his talents, he seems to show promise beyond just the field of chemistry. And there's a quite decent teacher."

"A teacher?"

Chairman Wang nodded with a mysterious smile.

Suddenly, the Western novel "Big Brother" came to mind. It was a book I enjoyed reading as a child.

The protagonist wishes on a falling star and suddenly becomes an adult. The novel depicts various happenings as the now-adult protagonist gets employed at a toy company, continuing to get promoted and even finding love thanks to his childlike business plans.

But reality wasn't a novel or a comic.

"Please take care until I come back, Assistant Choi."

Assistant Choi felt like he had become a nanny. After all, he was guiding a teenage boy who had just entered high school around the company, which was quite exhausting.

Had it not been for the orders of Kim Sang-guk, the director of the Strategic Planning Office, he would have immediately called the security guards to kick him out. However.

"Your name is Hyun, right?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Assistant Choi felt puzzled by the prim attitude of Kang Hyun. Was it because he was still a child, or was he inherently fearless?

Moreover, even his steps were unhesitant. He was acting as if he had worked in the company for ages. Even casually getting coffee from the vending machine.

"Would you like black coffee, Assistant Choi?"

"Oh, uh. Thank you."

"Am I a bother to you? Normally, you wouldn't go this far for a new recruit."

What kind of proficient attitude was this? Well, it was indeed overprotection, as Kang Hyun mentioned.

Who would give a new recruit a complete tour of the company from A to Z? Normally, they would learn the job while getting scolded by their superior.

"Which department do you belong to, Assistant Choi? It doesn't seem like the Strategic Planning Office, is it the training department?"

"How did you know?"

"I could tell by your appearance and tone. People in HRD training often have a similar vibe."

Was he a Sherlock Holmes or something? Assistant Choi was dumbfounded. Not only did this teenage boy correctly guess his department, but he even used professional corporate training terminology.

"Let's go, I think we've seen enough for now."

It turned into a situation where Kang Hyun led and Assistant Choi followed. They arrived at an office set up at the corner of the training department.

Since the Strategic Planning Office wasn't a place you could enter freely, they had to stay there until Kim Sang-guk finished his meeting.

"Director Kim said to look at this until he arrives."

It was a pile of documents. Assistant Choi had glanced at them but couldn't make heads or tails of it.

However, as soon as Kang Hyun received the documents, he nodded. Then he picked up a red pen lying around the office and sat down.

His seriousness was so intense that Assistant Choi couldn't even think of talking to him and quietly left the office.

* * *

Clickâ€”! Click.

What a cheerful sound. To think they would give a test on the first day. I habitually flipped through the pages and checked them with a red pen.

It was a report predicting the future growth potential of foreign companies. It was an extension of the heated debates we had in the meeting room earlier.

It seemed that Director Kim Sang-guk wanted to verify whether I was the real deal. Anyway.

"Should I make a few mistakes?"

There was no need for perfection. After all, I was here to learn.

I flipped through the pages until about halfway through the pile of documents and then closed the pen cap. I wanted to see what level of competence Kim Sang-guk, who would later secure a solid position in the Blue House, had. At that moment.

"Hyun, Director Kim is calling for you. Let's go."

I gathered the pile of documents and followed Assistant Choi.

It was a familiar face I was glad to see. He was the training manager at Jeil Group, responsible for executive leadership training in my previous life. One thing that remained consistent from his youth to his middle age was that he always aligned himself well.

Naturally, having survived in a jungle-like company environment for so long, it was to be expected.

"Assistant Choi, don't you think everyone looks quite intense?"

It seemed it was Assistant Choi's first time entering the Strategic Planning Office. His shoulders and neck were stiff with tension. I worried that he might even develop a stiff neck from the strain.

Although I was trying to ease his tension, it seemed to make him even more tense.

Well, it was understandable since the Strategic Planning Office was filled with seasoned veterans.

"Thank you, Assistant Choi."

"Not at all. If you need anything next time, please feel free to ask."

Anyone would think he was a bottom-rung employee in the Strategic Planning Office, not in training. Assistant Choi exaggeratedly bowed his head and walked away.

Without saying a word, I handed the pile of documents to Director Kim Sang-guk.

"Hmm."

I could see Director Kim Sang-guk's eyes gradually widening as he flipped through the pages. But when he realized there were no more annotations halfway through, he looked puzzled.

"Your name is Kang Hyun, right?"

"Yes, Director."

"Did you make mistakes on purpose? Or do you genuinely not know?"

Director Kim Sang-guk looked me straight in the eyes and added,

"It seems to me that you know."

New recruits always face a dilemma.

When there's a task they don't know how to do, should they ask about it? And if so, how should they ask?

After much deliberation, when they finally ask how to do it, their superior says with a look of disdain,

"Are you a child? Why can't you handle your work proactively as an adult?"

In that sense, the Strategic Planning Office was composed of proactive employees.

"Veterans are indeed veterans."

They were all experienced, and their work efficiency was as quick as the stock market right before the KOSPI closed. The saying "faster than the eye" was apt.

Wondering what exactly the Strategic Planning Office does?

Simply put, it was like a gatekeeper. It controlled and decided the flow and direction of the massive funds within Jeil Group. However,

"That's not right."

I glanced at the report in Deputy Oh Tae-seok's hand.

It was a report he had meticulously prepared, but I could tell at a glance that it was off. I heard he was from BOA, but he seemed to lack insight into the domestic market.

"Do you have any questions? If you're thirsty, go to the break room for some orange juice. If you're really bored, go to the training department and ask Assistant Choi for another tour."

Deputy Oh Tae-seok's face showed clear discomfort. Understandably, he was probably excited about having a new junior after a long time, only to end up playing the role of a nanny.

But he couldn't be reckless. I had visited the Strategic Planning Office before with President Son Ilsung. There's even a rumor that I'm the potential son-in-law of Jeil Group.

"Okay, I'll go have some juice."

"Uh?"

What good would it do to correct his mistakes here? Moreover, I had no intention of being a pushover in the Strategic Planning Office. Compared to them, I had more experience in Jeil Group, if not equal.

"This place is still barren."

I got a cup of milk coffee from the vending machine and went up to the rooftop. In the future, this concrete floor would be turned into a garden. People walking below would look like ants.

It was boring, but what could I do? Chairman Wang had taken the trouble to arrange this.

Assigning work to a student was absurd from the start. I had no intention of working either.

"Huff, huff."

As I was sipping my coffee and killing time, Deputy Oh Tae-seok, drenched in sweat, burst onto the rooftop.

"What are you doing here without saying a word? I searched for you from the first floor. It was exhausting."

"You told me to kill time, didn't you?"

Deputy Oh Tae-seok looked speechless. He probably didn't expect to find me lying on a rooftop bench.

He seemed quite worried. He was probably afraid of getting scolded by Director Kim Sang-guk.

"Review your report again, Deputy."

"What?"

That should be enough. I said it in passing, so Deputy Oh Tae-seok looked bewildered. Understandably, I would be too.

But he would remember my words when his report gets rejected and sent back again.

"Isn't it time for the meeting?"

"Oh, yeah."

"Let's go down quickly."

Deputy Oh Tae-seok led the way, and I followed. I was like an odd one out in the Strategic Planning Office. Thanks to that, I could attend the planning meeting.

Of course, it was absurd. A high school student attending an internal meeting of the Strategic Planning Office, the brain of Jeil Group. But what could I do? Orders from above had to be followed.

Moreover, most of them treated me as if I didn't exist.

"Deputy Oh, you finally found him."

As we arrived at the meeting room, sharp gazes were directed at me. Understandably, I had been absent during work hours.

Who cares? They wouldn't give me a single report to handle anyway. At that moment,

"The person to lead the meeting has finally arrived."

"Pardon?"

"Everyone, look. This report belongs to Kang Hyun."

At that moment, Director Kim Sang-guk, who was sitting at the head, picked up the pile of documents. It was the investment report I had debated with President Son Ilsung earlier.

It seemed he had heard about the report from Chairman Wang.

"Let's see how the new recruit will persuade us."

Director Kim Sang-guk's face was full of curiosity and amusement. Understandably, it was hard to believe that a child had created this report.

As I stood up, I heard murmuring around me.
