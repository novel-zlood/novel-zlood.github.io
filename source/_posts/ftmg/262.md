[The Queen Elisabeth Competition is an internationally renowned competition with a long tradition, consisting of four categories: violin, piano, composition, and voice. The violin competition is held every three years, and this year, more rising violinists than ever have applied. Talented individuals who have been guided by famous maestros from various countries are arriving one by one in Brussels, Belgium, where the finals will take place.]

It was a documentary by Belgium's national broadcaster, RTBF. The broadcasting of the Queen Elisabeth Competition, which could be considered a national festival, was not only being aired across Europe but also in Asian countries such as Japan, China, and Korea.

The TV screen displayed the faces of the rising violinists who had come to Brussels from various countries.

As rookies representing their respective countries appeared, viewers from each nation cheered for their favorites in front of their TVs.

Korea was no exception. When violinists from the music department of Korea University appeared, cheers erupted from various places.

The popularity was so immense that it was difficult to consider it just a documentary broadcast. On its first airing, the streets were almost deserted.

How could a documentary about the Queen Elisabeth Competition be so popular in Korea, known as a barren land for classical music? The reason was simple.

[The judges invited for the Queen Elisabeth Competition have truly remarkable resumes. First, there is Mr. Hugo, known as the father of the French violin world, Mr. Deng Lun, known as the sage of the East, and Ms. Hirose, the Japanese maestro with the nickname "Queen of Strings," and Mr. Viktor from Russia, who is as famous in the classical music world as his charismatic looks...]

Gulp.

[Lastly, we have Mr. Kang Hyun, who won the Queen Elisabeth Competition seven years ago at the young age of 14. Not only was he the youngest winner, but he was also invited to be a judge at an age that could be considered the youngest in the history of classical music. His biography is so glamorous that it could be made into a movie. Perhaps it's due to his outstanding skills matching his handsome appearance, but there's even talk that if there is a Mozart of the 21st century, it would be Mr. Kang Hyun.]

As Kang Hyun's biography was introduced on the TV screen, his face was shown at the end, causing cheers loud enough to shake the neighborhood. To someone unfamiliar, it might have sounded like a goal was scored in the World Cup.

This clearly demonstrated that Kang Hyun's popularity in Korea was incomparable to that of an average singer or actor.

"Who on earth did my son take after to be so handsome?"

Yoo Hyunja's face was full of a happy smile. His smooth skin, sharp nose, and deep eyes that seemed to hold a clear lake exuded an indescribable aura.

"Oh my, even with the camera so close, he's not flustered at all. No matter how I see it, my son has nerves of steel."

Kang Hyun, reflected on the TV screen, was so composed that it was hard to believe he was only 21 years old.

Despite the pressure of standing shoulder to shoulder with maestros from various countries, there wasn't a hint of tension on Kang Hyun's face.

In fact, his appearance in a perfectly fitting suit was so fitting that one could easily mistake him for a young CEO of a famous company.

"Wow, he completely outshines movie stars, doesn't he?"

"Director, your son is so handsome."

"I've known Hyun since he was young, but he's really amazing. To shine so brightly in such an intimidating place, you really raised him well. I'm so envious."

Kang Hyun's father, Kang Sunwoo, was also watching the documentary at his company.

Coincidentally, there was an hour left until the end of the workday, so he and his employees were watching the broadcast together. Many of them knew Kang Hyun. After all, he had frequently visited the playgrounds with his grandfather as a child.

Lastly, the eccentric Dr. Tikhonov from Dongju Chemical rushed in, looking at Kang Hyun on the TV and shouting, "my hyun."

He wiped his eyes with a handkerchief, whether he was tearing up or not, and said in broken Korean, "I told him to become a scientist, but he became such a wonderful musician, sniff!"

"This year, there are many excellent violinists."

Everyone nodded in agreement with the words of Hugo, the French maestro.

The judges were mentoring the rising violinists assigned to them, and this year, the talent pool was exceptionally strong.

"Especially the student named Hotaru from Japan is remarkable. At first, I thought his skills were inferior to other violinists, but as days passed, I realized it was a misconception. I'm really curious to see how far he will grow at the Chapelle."

"What about Ethan from Northern Europe?"

"He is also an outstanding violinist. Frankly, this year's applicants have enough potential to progress even without our mentoring. I'm already looking forward to seeing what performances they will showcase on stage."

True to the name "the dawn of melodies at the Chapelle," the violinists practiced day and night. Perhaps because of this, it was said among violinists that experiencing the Chapelle was priceless.

The maestros from various countries seemed very curious about the evaluations of the rising stars from their own nations.

"Viktor, how are the applicants you are mentoring?"

At Hugo's question, everyone turned their attention to Viktor. But Viktor just stared blankly ahead as if he were in a daze.

"Viktor?"

"Oh, what did you say?"

"I asked about the applicants you are mentoring. Are you okay? You seem to be in poor condition."

Viktor shook his head.

"The twin violinists from America are very skilled. But the elder twin is more superior. The younger twin excels more in composition and arrangement than in violin performance."

After finishing his answer, Viktor became dazed again. Hadn't he stayed up all night?

Viktor still vividly remembered Kang Hyun's performance under the moonlight in the Chapelle's garden.

'Why is that man acting like that all of a sudden?'

Kang Hyun's face was full of curiosity. Viktor, who always glared at him with a stern expression as if he would devour him, now looked at him differently.

Sometimes, Viktor would gaze at him with a dreamy expression, or furrow his brow as if deep in thought.

'Should I ask him to play again?'

Viktor still felt like Kang Hyun's performance was lingering in his ears. At their first meeting, Viktor had dismissed Kang Hyun as a rookie.

But hadn't he listened to Kang Hyun's performance as the only audience member the previous night?

Viktor, who didn't believe in terms like prodigy or genius, found his old values shaken by Kang Hyun's melodies.

At that moment, Viktor gulped as he looked at Kang Hyun.

RTBF's PD Maria headed to the Bozar Hall early in the morning.

It was a concert hall that rising violinists dreamed of. Today, there was to be a meeting between the permanent conductor of the Belgian National Symphony Orchestra, Eden Simeon, and the violinists.

Twelve rising violinists arrived at the Bozar Hall. It was considered one of Europe's major halls, along with Carnegie Hall and Concertgebouw.

The spacious seats that could accommodate thousands, the antique interior, and the splendid embossed patterns on the ceiling naturally elicited exclamations from the viewers.

The Belgian National Symphony Orchestra awaited the twelve rising violinists. They had already finished tuning their instruments as if they were rehearsing.

At that moment, Maestro Eden Simeon's hands fiercely slashed through the air.

Thud, thud, thudâ€•!

There was no time to be dumbfounded. Although the symphony started suddenly, the twelve violinists were immersed as if they were absorbed like tissue soaked in water. PD Maria and the filming director felt the same.

However, Kang Hyun, who accompanied them to the Bozar Hall, wore a faint smile, as if he had expected the orchestra's sudden performance.

As the orchestra's enchanting performance ended, Eden Simeon turned his head and looked at the violinists seated in the audience.

"What did you feel while listening to the symphony?"

Eden Simeon's charisma seemed to overwhelm everyone. Some said the symphony was simply enchanting, while others couldn't help but be amazed at the maestro's conducting skills.

Of course, Anna was different. She had already heard Eden Simeon's enigmatic symphony seven years ago.

"There were two mistakes?"

"Maestro, to be precise, I only found two mistakes."

But even she only found the mistakes in the second and third movements.

Kang Hyun glanced at Sabrina. However, she couldn't solve Eden Simeon's enigma. It was evidence that although she had tremendous talent for the violin, it didn't extend to other instruments.

PD Maria didn't understand the current situation. How could anyone find all the mistakes just by listening to the symphony once?

In fact, when the beautiful violinist Anna found two mistakes, people were already amazed. Other violinists had found at most one mistake, and even that wasn't certain.

Could this really be a problem that could be solved realistically?

Other rising violinists probably had thoughts similar to Maria's.

The more evocative the music, the more people were busy being enchanted rather than finding mistakes.

Moreover, the Belgian National Symphony Orchestra's skill was on par with the world's leading orchestras.

Furthermore, Eden Simeon, the permanent conductor, was a legendary violinist who, together with Jascha Heifetz, opened the dawn of the 20th century, and was a favorite disciple of Maestro Gustav.

In the classical music world, Eden Simeon of Belgium, Spencer of England, and Yuri of Germany were considered the next generation legends to follow the fame of the great Karajan.

Then it happened. Eden Simeon took a step forward towards the audience and spoke.

"Until now, there have been violinists who vaguely found one or two mistakes. Everyone said it was impossible to solve this enigma entirely. But there was a violinist who solved all my enigmas. It was the first time in decades, and no one has solved it since that violinist."

What was he talking about?

While Maria looked at Eden Simeon with a puzzled expression, Eden smiled warmly and looked at the musician who had brought the twelve violinists to the Bozar Hall.

The filming director's camera naturally followed Eden's gaze.

"Hyun, can we expect the same this time too?"
