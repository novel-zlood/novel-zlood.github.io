[Queen Elisabeth Competition is a prestigious international competition consisting of four categories: violin, piano, composition, and instrumental music. The violin category is held every three years, and this year, more young violinists than ever have applied. Talented musicians, guided by renowned masters from each country, are arriving in Brussels, Belgium, for the finals.]

It was a documentary by Belgium's national broadcaster RTBF. The broadcast, which filmed the Queen Elisabeth Competition, a national festival, was not only aired across Europe but also in Asian countries such as Japan, China, and Korea.

The faces of the young violinists from various countries who came to Brussels were shown on the screen.

As the rookies representing their countries made their appearances, viewers from each nation cheered for their favorites in front of their screens.

Korea was no exception. When violinists from the Korean University of Music appeared, cheers erupted from various places.

The popularity was truly extraordinary, to the point where it was hard to believe it was just a documentary broadcast. On the first day of the documentary's airing, it was difficult to find people on the streets.

How could a documentary about the Queen Elisabeth Competition be so popular in Korea, which is often called a barren land for classical music? The reason was simple.

[The achievements of the judges invited for the Queen Elisabeth Competition are truly remarkable. First, there is Mr. Hugo, known as the father of the French violin world, Mr. Deng Lun, called the sage of the East, Hirose, the Japanese master with the nickname queen of the strings, and Viktor from Russia, who is as famous in the classical world as his charismatic appearance suggests...]

Gulp.

[Lastly, there is Kang Hyun, who won the Queen Elisabeth Competition seven years ago at the mere age of 14. Not only did he win as the youngest ever, but he has also been invited as a judge at a very young age, which is unprecedented in classical music history. His life story is as dazzling as a movie. With his handsome appearance and outstanding skills, there are even rumors that if there is a Mozart of the 21st century, it must be Kang Hyun.]

As Kang Hyun's biography was introduced on the screen, his face was shown, and the neighborhood erupted in cheers. To someone who didn't know, it might have sounded like a goal was scored in the World Cup.

This clearly showed how Kang Hyun's popularity in Korea was incomparable to that of most singers or actors.

"Who did our son take after to be so handsome?"

Yoo Hyun-ja's face was filled with a happy smile. His smooth skin, sharp nose under thick eyebrows, and deep eyes like a clear lake created an indescribable aura.

"Oh my, he's not even flustered with the camera so close. No matter how you look at it, our son's courage is something to be proud of."

The appearance of Kang Hyun on the screen, looking composed despite being only 21 years old, was hard to believe.

Even though the pressure of standing shoulder to shoulder with the masters from various countries could be overwhelming, there was not a trace of tension on Kang Hyun's face.

Rather, dressed in a perfectly fitting suit, Kang Hyun looked as if he could be described as a young CEO of a famous company.

"Wow, he completely outshines movie stars!"

"Director, your son is so handsome."

"I've seen Hyun since he was young, and he's truly amazing. He should be nervous in such a position, but he's shining so brightly. Director, you've raised your son wonderfully. I'm really envious."

Kang Hyun's father, Kang Sun-woo, was also watching the documentary at his company.

He happened to have an hour left before leaving work, so he was watching the broadcast with his employees, many of whom knew Kang Hyun. After all, wasn't it the playground he used to visit holding his grandfather's hand when he was little?

Lastly, Dr. Tikhonov, the eccentric from Dongju Chemical, rushed in, looking at Kang Hyun on the screen and shouting, "my hyun."

Wiping his eyes with a handkerchief as if to brush away tears, he said in broken Korean, "I told him to become a scientist, but he became such a splendid musician, sniff!"

"This year, there are many excellent violinists."

Everyone nodded in agreement at the words of Hugo, the French master.

The judges were mentoring the young violinists assigned to them, and this year there were more outstanding violinists than ever.

"Especially the student from Japan named Hotaru is amazing. At first, I thought he was less skilled compared to other violinists, but as the days passed, I realized it was a misconception. I'm really curious to see how much he will grow at the Chapel."

"What about Ethan from Northern Europe?"

"He is also an excellent violinist. Honestly, this year's applicants have enough potential to move forward even without our mentoring. I am already looking forward to seeing what kind of performances they will give on stage."

True to the nickname "the dawn of melodies of the Chapel," the violinists practiced day and night. Perhaps because of this, the violinists often said that experiencing the Chapel made a world of difference.

The masters from each country seemed very curious about the evaluations of the rookies from their countries.

"Viktor, how are the applicants you are mentoring?"

At Hugo's question, everyone's eyes turned to Viktor. But Viktor was staring blankly ahead as if he were in a daze.

"Viktor?"

"Oh, what did you say?"

"I asked how the applicants you are mentoring are doing. Are you okay? You look quite unwell."

Viktor shook his head.

"The twin violinists from America are very skilled. However, the older one is more dominant. The younger one is more talented in composition and arrangement than in violin performance."

After answering, Viktor returned to his dazed state. Hadn't he spent the night awake?

Viktor's mind was still vividly filled with the image of Kang Hyun playing in the moonlight at the Chapel's garden.

'What's wrong with that guy all of a sudden?'

Kang Hyun's face was filled with curiosity. Viktor, who always glared at him with a fierce look as if he wanted to devour him, had changed his gaze.

Sometimes, Viktor looked at him with a dreamy expression or furrowed his brows as if deep in thought.

'Should I ask him to play again?'

Viktor felt as if Kang Hyun's performance was still lingering in his ears. Even though Viktor had dismissed Kang Hyun as a novice during their first encounter, hadn't he been the sole audience to Kang Hyun's performance the previous night?

Viktor, who never believed in terms like prodigy or genius, found his long-held beliefs shaken by Kang Hyun's melodies.

At that moment, Viktor swallowed hard, staring at Kang Hyun.

RTBF producer Maria headed to the Bozar Hall early in the morning.

It was a concert hall that young violinists dreamt of. Today, there was to be a meeting between the permanent conductor of the Belgian National Symphony Orchestra, Eden Simeon, and the violinists.

Twelve young violinists arrived at the Bozar Hall, which is considered one of the major halls in Europe, along with Carnegie Hall and the Concertgebouw.

The spacious audience seats that could accommodate thousands of people, the antique interior, and the splendid embossed patterns adorning the ceiling naturally elicited admiration from the onlookers.

The Belgian National Symphony Orchestra, which had already tuned their instruments as if in rehearsal, faced the twelve young violinists.

At that moment, Maestro Eden Simeon sharply cut through the air with his hands.

Boomâ€•!

There was no time to be dumbfounded. Though the symphony started abruptly, the twelve violinists were absorbed as if soaked in water like tissue paper. Producer Maria and the cameraman were the same.

However, Kang Hyun, who accompanied them to the Bozar Hall, wore a faint smile as if he had anticipated the sudden performance of the orchestra.

As the orchestra's enchanting performance ended, Eden Simeon turned to look at the violinists seated in the audience.

"So, what did you feel while listening to the symphony?"

Everyone felt overwhelmed by Eden Simeon's charisma. Some said the symphony was simply enchanting, while others couldn't help but admire the maestro's conducting skills.

Of course, Anna was different. She had already heard Eden Simeon's mysterious symphony seven years ago.

"Are there two mistakes?"

"Maestro, to be precise, I only found two mistakes."

But even she could only find the mistakes in the second and third movements.

Kang Hyun glanced at Sabrina. But she couldn't solve Eden Simeon's riddle. It was proof that while she had immense talent for the violin, it didn't extend to other instruments.

Producer Maria couldn't understand the current situation. How could anyone find all the mistakes by listening to the symphony just once?

In fact, when Anna, the beautiful violinist, said she found two mistakes, there was an outburst of admiration. Other violinists could only find one at best, and even those were uncertain.

Is it possible to solve this riddle?

The thoughts of the other young violinists were probably not much different from Maria's.

The more profoundly moving the music, the more one would be immersed in the ecstasy rather than looking for mistakes.

Furthermore, the Belgian National Symphony Orchestra's skills were on par with the world's leading orchestras.

And Eden Simeon, the permanent conductor, was a legendary violinist who opened the 20th century's dawn with Yasha Heifetz and was a favorite disciple of Maestro Gustav.

In the classical music world, Eden Simeon, Spencer of England, and Yuri of Germany were considered the next legends to follow in the footsteps of the great Karajan.

It was then that Eden Simeon took a step forward towards the audience and spoke.

"Until now, some violinists have vaguely found one or two. They all said it was impossible to solve this riddle completely. But there was a violinist who solved all of the riddles I posed. It was the first time in decades, and no one has solved it since that violinist."

What is he talking about?

Maria looked at Eden Simeon with a puzzled expression.

Eden smiled warmly and looked at the musician who had led the twelve violinists to the Bozar Hall.

The cameraman's camera naturally followed Eden's gaze.

"Hyun, can we look forward to it again this time?"
