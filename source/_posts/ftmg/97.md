"Did you meet the violinist Hyun?"

The lion of the Berlin Philharmonic widened his eyes.

"Honestly, I still don't understand. I vividly remember his performance with the London Symphony two years ago. At the age of thirteen, few can show such boldness in front of so many audiences. But to have such skills and yet wander around film sets instead of holding solo concerts?"

The lion's brows were deeply furrowed.

It was still a time when collaborations between film productions and orchestras were minimal. In fact, there was even talk among mainstream musicians that classical music should not be used as background music for films.

How much time had passed? The lion then realized that he had failed to control his anger.

"I'm sorry for raising my voice, Maestro."

"No, it's alright. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Are you curious about how he's changed over the past two years?"

The petals floating on the teacup shook.

"They say a fine sword doesn't rust over time, and isn't it now that his bow truly shines? Listening to his performance, I was once again amazed. I understood how Professor Auer felt when he looked at young Yasha. Yuri, you should have heard his lyra performance."

Despite the broken back of the violin, didn't it still produce beautiful melodies?

"If Maestro speaks so highly of him, then it means his skills haven't diminished at all over the past two years."

"That's right. It's more accurate to say he's growing at an unimaginable rate. If I were ten years younger, I would have wanted to collaborate with that boy. Now I understand why Spencer in London wanted him so badly. Spencer seems to have decided to wait for Hyun's choice. Itâ€™s pointless to rush if you can't capture the boy's heart. In that sense, Spencer resembles Professor Auer."

Click, the sound of a teacup being placed down was heard.

"Yuri, do you still want to bring Hyun to the Berlin Philharmonic as a guest member? Or do you want to teach him yourself? When I look at you, I think of my old mentor, Professor Vasily. Unlike Professor Auer, he had to get what he wanted to be satisfied."

Gustav and the lion's eyes met.

"If you're that anxious, why not go and visit him?"

"Hyun, breakfast is ready."

It was a familiar voice I hadn't heard in a while. With a towel around my neck, I went downstairs, and a savory smell tickled my nose.

The only regret was that Dr. Tikhonov was nowhere to be seen. Of course, he couldn't stay at the Ichon-dong mansion forever.

At that moment,

"Hyun!"

Suddenly, someone hugged me from behind. My old inspection habit almost made me elbow their face.

Turning my head, I saw Dr. Tikhonov, looking pale.

"Didn't you go back to Russia, Doctor?"

"The boss offered me a formal scout. Although the company provided accommodation, the boss said I could have breakfast with you, so I come to the mansion every morning. I was so happy to hear that you arrived last night. By the way, your reflexes are no joke! Oh, I should help Madam. She's been enjoying learning Korean dishes lately. Madam, I'm coming!"

Typical chatterbox doctor. His eccentricity remained unchanged. But thanks to him, the breakfast table felt lively.

Grandfather, who was about to pick up his spoon, glanced at me.

"Hyun, did you learn and see a lot in Italy?"

"Yes, being abroad, I feel like my perspective has broadened. The cultural life and values of people are different from Korea."

"It must have been a good time. By the way, Yooha's grandfather said he must see you. He mentioned something about settling the composition fee, and you would understand?"

Oh no, he's talking about the Guarneri. Considering it costs 1.5 million dollars, it seemed too much to call it a composition fee.

While I was pondering how to deal with the old fox,

"Hyun, would you like to come to the lab today? The team members are eagerly waiting for you."

"Dr. Tikhonov, are our researchers that eager to see Hyun?"

"Boss, just like musicians have muses that inspire them, Hyun is that kind of presence to our team. So, Hyun, would you like to come?"

Regretfully, I shook my head. Dr. Tikhonov looked puzzled, but it couldn't be helped. The reason was simple.

"I have to go to school."

Wearing the school uniform after a long time felt strange. The sleeves, which might have been short, fit perfectly, making me feel a bit resentful. But the good news was that the time for growth spurts wasn't far off.

I took the school car driven by Mr. Kim. Occasionally, I felt the gazes of students recognizing me. Even though they were my classmates, we were all unfamiliar with each other due to my frequent absences.

"Hyun, could you give a speech as the student representative at the graduation ceremony?"

"Me?"

The homeroom teacher's face showed signs of distress. Usually, the student council president gives the graduation speech. There must be a reason for this unusual request.

"Since you transferred, you've consistently been at the top of the school and brought a lot of recognition to our school. The principal specifically requested this. The students also want you to be the graduation representative."

"The students?"

It was unexpected. I thought the principal might be trying to impress Im Hyera, the director, but I didn't expect the students. I assumed they would look at me with disdain for not attending school.

"Yes. Especially the music department students really like you. By the way, if you have time today, could you visit the music department and watch their rehearsals? They're all exempt from classes because of the upcoming competition."

Being a middle school under the Jeil Foundation, the school facilities were exceptional, and the club activities were outstanding. They even had equipment that could be found in top music colleges.

Although it felt a bit embarrassing, the teacher kept pushing me, and before I knew it, I was in front of the music room.

The teacher entered first and introduced me to the students.

"Hyun is back at school after finishing his filming. You all wanted to meet him, right? If you have any questions, ask him."

The students froze as if they had seen a ghost. Some girls rubbed their eyes with their uniform sleeves in disbelief.

But there were more students than I expected. Are they planning to compete in a youth orchestra competition?

"A solo concert?"

Im Hyera, the director, unexpectedly made a proposal to me.

"Instead of just writing scores in the studio every day, how about holding a solo concert? You know how many fans are waiting for you, right?"

Of course, I knew. Didn't I hold a signing event in Venice? But it felt premature. I wasn't thinking of holding a solo concert, especially considering the current unsettled social atmosphere.

At that moment, as if reading my mind, Im Hyera continued.

"You can direct the proceeds from the solo concert towards social contributions. Of course, the profits you make will be provided by the Jeil Foundation. To be precise, the Jeil Foundation plans to sponsor you by holding the solo concert."

Surely, the Jeil Foundation wouldn't spend money without reason. They aim to enhance their corporate image and use the concert as an opportunity to recruit musicians.

According to rumors, they are considering Baek Jung-hoon for the gallery. As expected, Im Hyera had a keen sense for the entertainment business.

"But still, not yet."

It's essential to give a clear answer in business. I remembered how frustrating it was to receive ambiguous answers while doing business with the Japanese in my past life.

Moreover, I wanted to pursue music, not necessarily hold a solo concert.

Money wasn't an issue. Considering Paganini's running guarantee aside from copyright, I was sure to be financially secure.

At that moment.

"Author, you have a guest."

It was the voice of Mi-hyun noona. It seemed like a guest of Im Hyera had come to the gallery.

I got up to finish my work. Im Hyera looked visibly disappointed, as she couldn't finalize the solo concert.

"Mi-hyun, who is the guest? I don't have any appointments today."

Then Mi-hyun noona looked at me and started speaking. "To be precise, they came to meet the violinist Hyun." Me?

"Sauvignon Blanc, please."

The acidity and fresh fruit aroma of the white wine filled my mouth.

Yuri, the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic, also calmed his racing heart with wine when he first went to meet Hyun two years ago.

Over the past two years, many outstanding violinists had applied for membership. Among them were even next-generation maestros well-known by their names. However,

Like listening to an old masterpiece, why did that boy's melody keep resonating in Yuri's ears? The more he listened to the eternal Maestro Gustav's words, didn't his heart pound even louder?

Had it not been for Gustav's advice, Yuri might not have considered coming to Korea. The view of Seoul gradually appeared outside the plane window.

"I heard violinist Hyun is here?"

The gallery staff greeted Yuri skillfully. It was Kim Mi-hyun, who had become proficient in English.

"Did you make an appointment?"

"Unfortunately, I couldn't get his contact information, so I didn't make an appointment. But is it true that violinist Hyun works here?"

No matter how much he looked around, it seemed like a typical gallery. The modern artworks displayed here and there were pieces Yuri was familiar with. It was hard to believe there was a musician's studio here.

"Currently, he has an appointment with another guest. May I ask who I should inform him?"

"Tell him it's Yuri from Berlin."

Kim Mi-hyun, who was on the intercom, nodded a few times and then walked straight towards Yuri.

"Sir, I will guide you now."

After passing through the sophisticatedly decorated gallery hallway, they arrived in front of a large office.

Yuri wondered if the office, which looked like the representative's, belonged to the violinist Hyun he knew. At that moment,

As the office door opened, Yuri's brows furrowed.

"Spencer?"

Isn't he the conductor of the London Symphony? He didn't expect the previous guest to be Spencer. Spencer also seemed visibly surprised to see Yuri.

"What brings you here, Maestro?"

"I stopped by Korea briefly after a performance in Japan. By the way, I wanted to ask, why are you here, the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic?"

"I'm on a sabbatical after the last performance, so I decided to travel around Asia."

"Traveling around Asia?"

Hyun stood up to greet Yuri. It seemed like a fight might break out between the two if left alone.

"Long time no see, Maestro."

Yuri shook hands with Hyun, but his gaze was still intense. "You haven't neglected your violin practice, Hyun. Your hands are full of calluses."

"Since I have to play Paganini's pieces, I can't afford to rest. But I never expected both of you to come and see me. Our president is also extremely surprised. Such renowned conductors visiting me on the same day. What's going on?"
