“Engagement ceremony?”

The reception room was filled with an old fragrance.

“Son Jangwon, as you mentioned before, wouldn't it be time to consider an engagement ceremony?”

“Old man, it seems like you’re in a hurry all of a sudden. Does that mean you really like Yooha?”

“Of course. A well-mannered and kind girl like her is rare. Moreover, Hyun seems to like Yooha quite a bit.”

The smiles never left the faces of the grandfathers as they chatted.

Indeed, just seeing their grandchildren brought them immense joy.

Chairman Wang suddenly remembered something, took a sip from his teacup, and started speaking.

“Old man, do you remember Judge Jung?”

“Are you talking about the Judge Jung from the Supreme Court? The one you’re friends with?”

“He's retired now and working at a university. He declined the department chair position because he's never been one for materialism. He's a straight-laced man, and I often have candid conversations with him. He told me a fascinating story a few days ago.”

“A fascinating story?”

As Chairman Yoo listened intently, Chairman Wang's lips moved several times. The story passed down by the old professor from the Korean University Law Department was as intriguing as a folktale.

“He said there’s a student in his class whose legal knowledge surpasses that of most law students. It would be one thing if this student were a senior, but surprisingly, they are a freshman. Moreover, they aren’t even in the law department. Judge Jung was astonished during a discussion on legal interpretations with this student, saying it was like talking to a seasoned legal expert.”

“Did Judge Jung really say that?”

“Yes. He said it felt like he was conversing with an equal, not just a professor and a student. Of course, I wouldn’t have been as interested if that were all. But when Judge Jung told me who this person was, I was speechless.”

Chairman Wang couldn’t hide his astonishment when he heard about Kang Hyun from Judge Jung.

Not only was he impressive as a musician and a businessman, but his legal knowledge was exceptional as well. Even Judge Jung, who had spent his life wrestling with the law at the Supreme Court, acknowledged him.

“Hyun?”

Chairman Yoo seemed surprised but then nodded as he remembered the Jeon Wanyong case from years ago. Even back then, Kang Hyun had shown exceptional promise.

“Son-in-law, our grandson-in-law has a knack for surprising people. Isn't he also the only one in Korea who is friends with Chairman Barbara? By now, Chairman Barbara should be arriving. I heard it’s being broadcast live on national TV.”

Indeed, not only major corporations but even the Blue House were paying close attention. The TV stations were broadcasting live from the airport.

The two grandfathers then turned their attention to the large television screen.

Gimpo International Airport was bustling from the morning. After all, Chairman Barbara was visiting Korea.

Not only reporters but also TV stations and government officials were present. It was like a state visit.

Given the nation’s declining credit rating after the financial crisis, the confirmation of Barbara Group’s investment in Korea was a major boon.

“There she comes—!”

At someone’s shout, Chairman Barbara emerged from the arrivals hall.

Despite being middle-aged, her chiseled features and deep brown eyes rivaled those of any Hollywood actor.

Her entourage and security detail, numbering in the dozens, were reminiscent of a royal procession from the Joseon Dynasty.

As the camera flashes intensified, the government officials’ faces grew more tense. After all, no one knew why Chairman Barbara was visiting Korea.

Chairman Barbara was a hot topic on global stock markets, and meeting her was said to be harder than meeting the President of the United States.

Rumor had it that she would be visiting various countries in Asia, including the Korean Blue House, the Chinese government, and Japan’s Ministry of Finance.

“Chairman Barbara, what brings you to Korea so suddenly?”

A brave TV reporter asked in English. Although the security guards immediately blocked the way, Barbara smiled gently and answered.

“I came to meet a friend.”

“A friend?”

The unexpected answer left the reporter and all other journalists visibly puzzled.

In the midst of everyone’s confusion, Chairman Barbara suddenly started walking, causing the live broadcast cameras to hurriedly follow her.

Huh?

Chairman Barbara was walking toward someone, her face filled with a broad smile.

As government officials and reporters watched in bewilderment, Barbara stood before a man wearing a deeply pulled-down hat.

“It’s been a long time, Hyun.”

Kang Hyun couldn’t hide his surprise. He hadn’t expected Chairman Barbara to recognize him immediately from such a distance.

After all, hadn’t he just been hugging Son Yooha? Yooha looked up at Hyun with wide, rabbit-like eyes.

Hyun thought he should probably introduce them.

Journalists stared in shock at Chairman Barbara and the man in the hat. Chairman Barbara, known for her stoic expressions, was smiling brightly while talking to an unknown man.

Someone finally recognized the man under the hat and exclaimed.

“Violinist Kang Hyun!”

In an instant, the crowd buzzed, and camera flashes went off. No one had expected that the person Chairman Barbara was so friendly with would be Kang Hyun.

A few years ago, he had conducted at the British Royal Palace at a young age, causing a sensation, and recently, he had made headlines in Korea for achieving a perfect score on the college entrance exam.

“Chairman Barbara, what is your relationship with Violinist Hyun?”

“Were you originally close with Chairman Barbara?”

Questions poured in as if a dam had burst. The camera director made sure not to miss this moment, zooming in on the faces of the two.

Chairman Barbara smiled faintly and answered.

“I am friends with Violinist Hyun.”

The unexpected answer brought a brief silence, but soon the camera flashes exploded again.

Under the dazzling spotlight, Chairman Barbara, Kang Hyun, and Son Yooha were being broadcast live across the nation.

“What’s Chairman Barbara’s schedule?”

The presidential secretary’s office was busy. Chairman Barbara’s visit to Korea had officially begun.

Nothing had been disclosed about her domestic schedule. Barbara Group hadn't revealed any specific reason for her visit.

“She has a luncheon scheduled with the President. Various ministers will be in attendance, and they plan to discuss an MOU for future investments in Korea.”

It wasn’t unusual for the head of state to get involved. Barbara Group wielded considerable influence even in the U.S.

If Barbara Group invested in Korea, which was struggling post-financial crisis, it would be a golden opportunity.

“Chief, the heads of major domestic companies, including Dongshin Group, have requested a dinner with Chairman Barbara.”

“A dinner?”

“Yes. They seem to think it would be a missed opportunity otherwise. However, Chairman Barbara doesn’t seem very interested in meeting corporate heads. She hasn’t given a clear response yet.”

Indeed, while these were top domestic companies, they still found it challenging to compete globally. Barbara Group, on the other hand, was among the world’s elite. Then,

“Chief, we’ve received a reply from Barbara Group.”

“Now?”

“Yes, regarding the dinner with corporate heads. Chairman Barbara has agreed to the dinner but with an unusual condition.”

An unusual condition?

“She wants to add individuals to the guest list beyond the listed corporate heads.”

“Add individuals? Let me see the document.”

The subordinate handed over the reply from Barbara Group without further comment.

Initially, top-tier domestic companies like Jeil Group were not participating.

However, the additional individuals requested by Chairman Barbara included not only Jeil Group but also Dongju, which was prominent in the chemical industry.

As the chief read through the document, his eyes widened at the last sentence.

“VH Company?”

“Hyun, was the person next to you in the photo your girlfriend?”

The day after the photo with Chairman Barbara was taken, Kim Daewoo seemed more curious about whether the woman in the photo was Yooha than about Barbara calling Hyun her friend.

Yooha’s face was cleverly obscured by Hyun’s profile in the photo, so it was understandable. Even the live broadcast cameras had focused more on Hyun and Chairman Barbara than on Yooha.

Just then, the old professor entered the lecture hall.

“Today, we’ll discuss the legal interpretation of criminal cases. I plan to cover actual past cases, so I hope students will share their honest opinions.”

The old professor’s eyes were sharp. Although this was supposed to be a general education course, the discussions had become increasingly advanced.

Today was no different. They were discussing the legal interpretation of a past case of implied intent to murder.

It was a heavy topic for freshmen, even for someone who had studied past bar exam cases.

“Is there any student who would like to discuss the legal interpretation of the case I just mentioned? It’s okay if your answer is legally incorrect. The law should always be based on common sense.”

The old professor was staring right at Hyun. The students’ gazes also naturally turned to him like jury members in a courtroom.

It had almost become routine for the professor and Hyun to engage in discussions during class.

When Hyun finally raised his hand, the professor smiled contentedly.

“Hyun, you really seem well-suited for the law department. Did you see the law students earlier? They were in awe of you. Are you planning to transfer to the law department?”

No way, Hyun thought. He didn’t want to major in law again in this life.

Not only Kim Daewoo but also the old professor frequently hinted at transferring to the law department after class. The professor even offered to help Hyun with the transfer exam.

Each time, Hyun firmly shook his head, clearly stating that while law was a hobby, it wouldn’t be his major.

“Hyun, we’re done with classes for today. How about some makgeolli?”

“Makgeolli?”

“Yes, do you know how many girls in our class want to talk to you? We have a freshman gathering today.”

Just as Hyun was considering attending to maintain class president Kim Daewoo’s dignity,

“Junior!”

A familiar face was waiting for Hyun in front of the college building. It was Chief Kim Sangguk, looking dapper.

“You need to go somewhere right away.”

“Right now?”

Due to Chief Kim Sangguk’s urgency, Hyun had to part ways with Kim Daewoo. As they got in the car, Chief Kim glanced at Hyun through the rearview mirror.

“First, you’ll need to change into a suit.”

“Wait a minute, Chief. Where are we going?”

“There’s a dinner gathering of major corporate heads hosted by Chairman Barbara tonight.”

A dinner gathering of major corporate heads? What did that have to do with him?

Chief Kim then got to the point.

“You’ve been invited as the representative of VH Company.”
