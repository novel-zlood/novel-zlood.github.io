[Breaking News. Governor Kim Sang-guk of Gyeongbuk has been appointed as the first Prime Minister of the Kim administration. Before entering politics, Governor Kim Sang-guk led the strategic planning office of the Jeil Group and later served as the CEO of the global investment group VH Company. Additionally, Prime Minister-designate Kim Sang-guk is said to be the youngest prime minister candidate in history, making his appointment a groundbreaking decision in the political world.]

The old TV in the tteokbokki shop was displaying Kim Sang-guk's face.

His angular jawline and sharp eyes were still the same. If anything, time had only added to his charisma. A stranger might think he looked more like a security chief than a prime minister.

[The public's reaction to Kim Sang-guk being appointed as the first Prime Minister of the Kim administration is very enthusiastic. It's been less than 10 years since Governor Kim Sang-guk entered politics, but he has always received fervent support from the public. Young people in particular seem to be very supportive. Citizens from not only Gyeongsang Province, his hometown and main area of activity, but also the capital region are cheering for the new blood entering the old political circle.]

Kim Sang-guk's entry into politics was dynamic enough to be called a movie.

Becoming the youngest governor of Gyeongbuk was impressive enough, but to secure the prime minister position in such a short time spoke volumes about the people’s desire for the eradication of corruption and political reform.

His popularity spanned all age groups.

“Is it 10 years faster than my last life?”

Kang Hyun chuckled as he looked at Kim Sang-guk on the TV. Kim Sang-guk had already told him the night before, in a trembling voice, that he had been appointed as the prime minister. Kang Hyun had undoubtedly played a big role in Kim Sang-guk's political entry.

Just then.

“Maestro?”

The editor-in-chief of a famous newspaper rushed over for an interview with Kang Hyun. Kang Hyun was notoriously reluctant to give interviews, so the editor-in-chief, Kim Seon-ah, was anxious.

“It’s such an honor to meet you. I’m Kim Seon-ah, editor-in-chief of Dongshin Ilbo.”

Kim Seon-ah looked every bit the intellectual. She couldn’t control her racing heart as she faced him.

Not only was he handsome enough to outshine most movie stars, but he was also a maestro who had achieved unprecedented records over the past decade. He was already a renowned maestro worldwide.

Moreover, his accolades didn’t end there.

“I never imagined you would choose a tteokbokki shop for the interview. You must really like tteokbokki, Maestro?”

It was a small tteokbokki shop run by an elderly couple near an elementary school in Seoul. The place was small and since the elementary students had not yet been dismissed, the only customers were Kang Hyun and Kim Seon-ah.

“There’s someone who loves tteokbokki a lot. And today is an important day, so I had no choice but to meet here. I hope you understand. If it’s alright, I’d like you to call me Kang Hyun instead of Maestro. Would that be uncomfortable?”

“Oh, no! If I could meet you, Kang Hyun, I’d jump into the depths of hell. You’re so popular in the media these days.”

“Your kind words leave me flattered. Feel free to ask whatever you’re curious about. As long as you promise not to exaggerate, I’ll answer honestly.”

Editor-in-chief Kim Seon-ah gulped.

She had a mountain of questions. Maestro Kang Hyun was always a mysterious figure.

His legendary stories were still prominent not just in the classical music world but also in the business world.

He had been knighted in England and was said to have a special friendship with the crown prince.

Rumors even said it was Kang Hyun who had elevated Kim Sang-guk to the position of prime minister-designate.

He was indeed a mysterious figure with countless epithets like Maestro, Virtuoso, and Midas’ Hand.

“Do you have any plans to enter politics, Kang Hyun? You are highly admired by both the younger and middle-aged generations. In a survey conducted by Dongshin Ilbo, many people wanted you to enter politics, even more than Prime Minister-designate Kim Sang-guk.”

Kang Hyun shook his head with a faint smile. He had no intention of entering politics. He remembered how hard he had worked in his past life to secure a position as a legislator.

Of course, if he wanted, both political parties would undoubtedly extend offers to him. He was confident he could secure a position in Seoul even as an independent.

However, politics was far from the life that would make Kang Hyun happy.

“I am happy living as a musician now.”

“It’s said that the members of the London Symphony Orchestra chose to come to Korea during their sabbatical because of you, Kang Hyun. There are rumors that you are planning a violin recital in Seoul. Is this true?”

“Journalists certainly have sharp ears. The London Symphony Orchestra has been pushing forward tirelessly. We decided to take a short sabbatical break, but these friends love concerts too much. Moreover, retired maestros are also coming to Korea. My members wouldn’t stay away even if I tried to stop them.”

Kim Seon-ah clenched her fists under the table. It was now confirmed that Kang Hyun’s solo recital would take place in Seoul. If his recital were held in Seoul, classical music fans worldwide would be buzzing.

The interview continued for another hour. When Kang Hyun glanced at his watch, he said,

“It’s about time...”

“Pardon?”

“Today is an important day.”

At that moment, the loud voices of children could be heard. It seemed school was out.

Children were flocking to the stall to eat fried snacks and tteokbokki. Just then, Kang Hyun stood up and called out to a child running toward him from a distance.

“Happiness!”

Happiness?

Editor-in-chief Kim Seon-ah's gaze naturally followed.

A boy who resembled Kang Hyun was running toward him. As he got closer, his features became more apparent.

He not only looked like Kang Hyun but also had a bright smile that made anyone who saw it smile in return.

On his left chest was a name tag, written in large letters with a small hand.

‘Kang Haneul.’

At the conductor’s signal, Anna placed the bow on the strings. Beads of sweat formed on Anna’s white forehead.

Maestro Eden Siméon, the permanent conductor of the Belgian National Symphony Orchestra, found and corrected Anna’s mistakes with ghost-like precision. His gaze beneath his red hair resembled Kang Hyun’s.

‘She’s good.’

Kang Hyun watched Anna during her final rehearsal. Despite the sweat pouring down her body, she was performing a concerto with the orchestra on stage.

Rehearsal was no less nerve-wracking. With just a few days left until the concert, perfect preparation was essential.

Kang Hyun could sense that Eden Siméon was smiling. Though he couldn’t see her face due to her passionate conducting, her swaying shoulders indicated she was pleased with Anna’s performance.

Producer Maria gulped as she watched the stage. She hoped Kang Hyun wouldn’t point out any mistakes after the performance.

Seeing Kang Hyun mentor young violinists was like witnessing magic. The cameraman, feeling the same, gripped his camera tightly.

‘Remarkable.’

Sitting in the audience, Kang Hyun marveled at Anna’s skills.

Her passionate bowing made it seem as if the curtains of the Bozar Hall were fluttering.

The melody from her violin blended seamlessly with the orchestra’s resonance, creating a picturesque harmony.

This was the result of seven years of intense training with Alexei at the Moscow Conservatory.

“You did wonderfully, Anna.”

Eden Siméon praised Anna after the rehearsal. Though there were a few awkward spots, it was quite impressive.

After all, it was nearly impossible to achieve perfect harmony with the orchestra in less than a fortnight.

In Siméon’s lifetime, only one person had achieved perfect harmony with the orchestra in such a short time: Kang Hyun, who was watching the stage with a satisfied smile.

“How did I do?”

Anna, having finished her rehearsal, cautiously asked Kang Hyun, perhaps conscious of the cameras.

Kang Hyun responded with a faint smile. With only a few days left, it was more important to boost her confidence than to point out mistakes.

“As an audience of one, I am very much looking forward to your performance, Anna.”

An undeniable smile spread across Anna's face. Though she wanted to hug Kang Hyun immediately, she held back due to the many watching eyes.

After a short break, the next candidate stepped onto the stage. It was Hotaru, a boy from Japan.

“Are you ready?”

At Eden Siméon’s question, Hotaru took his position. He vowed not to make any mistakes for the audience watching him.

Meanwhile, Kang Hyun, seeing Hotaru blush on stage, found it curious. The boy always blushed like a teenage girl whenever he saw him.

Thinking the boy was just shy, Kang Hyun gave him a reassuring smile and a short nod.

The cameraman, capturing the scene, zoomed in alternately on their faces.

* * *

It was night after the final rehearsal. Kang Hyun couldn’t sleep due to Viktor’s snoring.

It seemed Viktor was becoming more comfortable sharing a room with him, as his snoring grew louder by the day.

The days of living in isolation were now over. From midnight, they could start communicating with the outside world.

Kang Hyun left the snoring room, walked through the chapel garden, and called Korea directly.

“Mom, happy birthday!”

In Korea, it was Yu Hyunja's birthday. The house in Ichon-dong was likely filled with the aroma of seaweed soup early in the morning.

-Oh, son!

His mother’s voice was full of happiness. They talked at length about how many people in Korea were watching his documentary.

-Son, actually, I have something to tell you...

What could make his mother hesitate like this?

“Is something wrong?”

-No, not at all! I’m just too embarrassed to say it. I’ll let you talk to your father. Hold on a moment.

Soon, his father took the phone. His voice trembled slightly, filled with both nervousness and embarrassment.

-Hyun, actually, you’re going to have a sibling.

“What?”

-I only found out recently.

A rare broad smile spread across Kang Hyun’s face. He never expected to have a sibling.

His father, sounding a bit awkward, continued.

“Dad, are you saying I’m going to have a sibling?”

-Yes, you’re going to have a sibling.

“Wow! Congratulations!”

Under the moonlight, Kang Hyun jumped up and down in excitement. Surely the excitement was palpable even through the phone.

His grandfather’s hearty laughter could be heard beyond his father’s voice. Kang Hyun was filled with curiosity.

“Dad, have you decided on a name?”

-Not yet. We don’t even know the gender. We only have a prenatal name.

As expected, his father was quick with decisions.

Curious about the prenatal name, Kang Hyun asked with an excited voice. His father, also smiling happily, replied.
