[Breaking News: Governor Kim Sang-guk of North Gyeongsang Province has been nominated as the first Prime Minister of the Kim administration. Before entering politics, Governor Kim served as the head of strategic planning at Jeil Group and later as the CEO of the global investment group VH Company. Additionally, Governor Kim is noted for being the youngest prime ministerial candidate in the history of various administrations, making his nomination a groundbreaking event in the political world.]

The old TV in the tteokbokki shop was showing Kim Sang-guk's face.

His angular jaw and sharp eyes were still the same. If anything, time had only added to his charisma. To a stranger, he might look more suited to being a head of security rather than a prime minister.

[The nomination of Kim Sang-guk as the first Prime Minister of the Kim administration is receiving a very enthusiastic response from the public. Governor Kim has been in politics for less than ten years, but he has always garnered fervent support from citizens. Young people, in particular, are showing strong support. Not only in Gyeongsang Province, his hometown and main area of activity, but also in the metropolitan area, citizens are cheering for the influx of new blood into the old political sphere.]

Kim Sang-guk's entry into politics was so dynamic that it could be compared to a movie.

Becoming the youngest governor of North Gyeongsang Province was impressive enough, but now he had secured the position of Prime Minister in such a short time. It could be seen as a result of the public's desire to eradicate corruption and reform politics.

His popularity transcended generations.

"Is it ten years faster than in my previous life?"

Kang Hyun smirked as he watched Kim Sang-guk on the TV screen. Kim Sang-guk had already told him with a trembling voice the night before that he had been nominated for the position of Prime Minister. Kang Hyun had undoubtedly played a significant role in Kim's political entry.

It was then.

"Maestro?"

The editor-in-chief of a famous newspaper had come personally to interview Kang Hyun. Known for rarely giving interviews, Kang Hyun's agreement had made Editor-in-Chief Kim Seon-ah anxious that he might change his mind.

"It is an honor to meet you. I am Kim Seon-ah, the editor-in-chief of Dongshin Ilbo."

Kim Seon-ah had an intelligent appearance that suited her well. She couldn't control her pounding heart as she stood before Kang Hyun.

His looks were rivaling those of movie stars, and he was a maestro who had achieved unprecedented records over the past decade. He was already renowned worldwide as a maestro.

Moreover, his accomplishments didn't end there.

"I never imagined you would choose a tteokbokki shop for the interview. Is it because you really like tteokbokki, Maestro?"

It was an old tteokbokki shop run by an elderly couple in front of an elementary school in Seoul. The shop was small, and since the students hadn't finished school yet, Kang Hyun and Kim Seon-ah were the only customers.

"There is someone who loves tteokbokki immensely. Besides, today is an important day, so I had no choice but to meet here. I hope you understand. If it's okay with you, I'd like you to call me Kang Hyun instead of Maestro before we start the interview. Would that be uncomfortable for you?"

"Oh, no! I would have jumped into a pit of fire just to meet Kang Hyun. You are so hot in the media these days."

"Thank you for saying that. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. As long as you promise not to write exaggerated articles, I will answer honestly."

Editor-in-Chief Kim Seon-ah swallowed hard.

There were a mountain of questions she wanted to ask. Maestro Kang Hyun had always been a mysterious figure.

His legendary stories still resonated deeply not only in the classical music world but also in the business world.

He had been knighted in the UK and had a special friendship with the Crown Prince.

There were also rumors that Kang Hyun was the person who had helped Kim Sang-guk rise to the position of Prime Minister.

He was a man of many titles: Maestro, Virtuoso, Midas Touch, and more.

"Do you have any plans to enter politics, Maestro, I mean, Kang Hyun? You are considered the most admired figure not just by the younger generation but also by the middle-aged. In a survey conducted by our newspaper, more people wanted you to enter politics than Kim Sang-guk."

Kang Hyun shook his head with a faint smile. He had no thoughts of entering politics. In his previous life, he had run tirelessly to secure a seat as a lawmaker.

Of course, if he wanted to now, both the ruling and opposition parties would send love calls to him. Even if he ran as an independent, he was confident he could secure a seat in Seoul.

But politics was far from the life that brought Kang Hyun happiness.

"I like my life as a musician just as it is."

"There are rumors that the members of the London Symphony Orchestra, despite being on a sabbatical, have chosen to come to Korea. Is this related to you, the chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra? There are also rumors that you are planning to hold a violin recital in Seoul."

"Journalists really do have sharp ears. The London Symphony has been running hard without a break. We decided to take a short sabbatical, but the members love performing so much. Moreover, some retired maestros are also coming to Korea this time. My members wouldn't miss it even if I tried to stop them."

Kim Seon-ah clenched her fists under the table. The rumors of Kang Hyun's recital had been confirmed as fact. If Kang Hyun's recital were to be held in Seoul, classical music fans worldwide would be abuzz.

The interview continued for another hour. Kang Hyun glanced at his wristwatch and said.

"It's about time they arrived..."

"Pardon?"

"Today is an important day."

Just then, the loud voices of children could be heard. It seemed to be dismissal time.

The children came running to eat fried snacks and tteokbokki from the stall. At that moment, Kang Hyun stood up and called out to a child running from a distance.

"Haengbok!"

Haengbok?

Editor-in-Chief Kim Seon-ah's gaze naturally followed.

A boy who bore a striking resemblance to Kang Hyun was running towards him. The closer he got, the clearer his features became.

He not only resembled Kang Hyun in appearance but also had a bright smile that naturally brought a loving smile to the onlooker's lips.

On his left chest, there was a large name tag that seemed to have been handwritten with a tiny hand.

'Kang Haneul.'

* * *

At the conductor's signal, Anna brought her bow to the strings. Beads of sweat formed on her white forehead.

Maestro Eden Simeon, the permanent conductor of the Belgian National Symphony Orchestra, found and corrected Anna's mistakes as if he were a ghost. His gaze from beneath his red hair closely resembled Kang Hyun's.

'She's good.'

Kang Hyun watched Anna during her final rehearsal. Sweat was pouring down her body as she collaborated with the symphony orchestra on stage.

Just because it was a rehearsal didn't mean she wasn't nervous. With only a few days left before meeting the audience, perfect preparation was necessary.

Kang Hyun could tell that Eden Simeon was smiling. Although he couldn't see her face due to her enthusiastic conducting as if it were a real performance, he could tell from her moving shoulders. It meant that she was pleased with Anna's skills.

Producer Maria swallowed hard as she watched the stage. She hoped that Kang Hyun would correct any mistakes after the performance.

Watching Kang Hyun guide young violinists was like witnessing magic. The cameraman also seemed to share Maria's feelings, gripping the camera tightly.

'Excellent.'

Kang Hyun, seated in the audience, admired Anna's skills.

The passionate bowing was so intense that it seemed to make the curtains of the Bozar Hall flutter.

The melodies emanating from the violin harmonized perfectly with the symphony orchestra, creating a picturesque combination.

It was the result of seven years of special training under Alexei at the Moscow Conservatory.

"You did very well, Anna."

Eden Simeon praised Anna as she finished her rehearsal. Although there were still a few awkward parts, it was quite impressive.

Of course, achieving perfect harmony with the symphony orchestra in less than fifteen days was challenging.

In Simeon's entire life, only one person had achieved such perfect harmony with the orchestra in a short time. That person was Kang Hyun, who was now sitting in the audience with a pleased smile, watching the stage.

"How did I do?"

Anna, who had come down from the stage after the rehearsal, cautiously asked Kang Hyun, perhaps aware of the camera.

Kang Hyun responded with a faint smile. With only a few days left, it was more important to boost her confidence than to point out mistakes.

"As a member of the audience, I am looking forward to your performance, Anna."

An unmistakable smile spread across Anna's face. Although she wanted to hug Kang Hyun right then and there, she couldn't because of the many eyes watching.

After a short break, the next participant stepped onto the stage. It was a boy from Japan named Hotaru.

"Are you ready?"

At Eden Simeon's question, Hotaru took his position. Hotaru vowed not to make any mistakes for the audience watching him.

Meanwhile, Kang Hyun looked curiously at Hotaru, whose cheeks turned pink on stage. The boy always blushed like a teenage girl whenever he saw Kang Hyun.

Thinking that Hotaru was very shy, Kang Hyun smiled and nodded briefly to boost his confidence.

The cameraman, on the other hand, zoomed in on the faces of the two alternately.

* * *

It was the night after the final rehearsal. Kang Hyun couldn't sleep due to Viktor's snoring.

It seemed that as the days passed, the snoring grew louder. Apparently, Viktor was becoming more comfortable sharing a room with Kang Hyun.

The life of being cut off from the outside world was now over. Starting at midnight, they would be able to communicate with the outside world.

Kang Hyun left the room vibrating with snores and walked through the chapel garden to call Korea.

"Mother, happy birthday!"

In Korean time, it was Yu Hyun-ja's birthday today. Surely, the scent of seaweed soup would be wafting through the Icheon-dong residence early in the morning.

-Oh my, son!

The voice of his mother, who answered the phone, was filled with happiness. The conversation was filled with updates, as many people in Korea were watching the documentary.

-Son, actually, I have something to tell you...

What could it be that his mother was hesitating to say?

"Is it something bad?"

-It's nothing like that! I'm just too embarrassed to say it. I'll hand the phone to your father, hold on a moment.

Soon, his father took the phone. His father's voice came through the receiver.

-Ahem, Hyun-ah.

His father's voice was trembling, unlike usual. It was a mixture of nervousness and embarrassment.

-Hyun-ah, you have a younger sibling on the way.

"What?"

-I only found out recently myself.

A rare bright smile spread across Kang Hyun's face. He never expected to have a younger sibling.

His father hesitated for a moment before explaining further.

"Father, are you saying I have a younger sibling?"

-Ahem, yes, you have a younger sibling on the way.

"Wow! Congratulations!"

Kang Hyun couldn't contain his excitement as he jumped up and down under the moonlight. Surely, there would be excitement on the other end of the phone as well.

The hearty laughter of his grandfather could be heard beyond his father's voice. Kang Hyun had many questions.

"Father, have you decided on a name?"

-We haven't decided on a name yet. We don't even know the gender. We only have a nickname.

As expected, his father was quick to handle things.

Curious about the nickname, Kang Hyun asked in an excited voice. His father also smiled happily and said.

-The nickname is Haengbok (Happiness).
