Gulp―!

Park Sun-young was so nervous that even the sound of her own throat swallowing startled her.

It wasn't just her problem. The other new members sitting in the audience were in the same state.

The reason was simple. The tension on stage filled the concert hall like an epidemic.

"Dresden―!"

At Kang Hyun's shout, a member of the first violin section flinched. Had the pitch wavered slightly without them realizing it? Even if it was just a moment, Kang Hyun was picking out the member who made the mistake, as if he wouldn't tolerate even the slightest error.

Because of this, even the veteran members, who boasted impressive careers, couldn't afford to relax.

The sharper the conductor's hand movements, the sharper the members' performances became.

To an outsider, it might seem like a real performance rather than a rehearsal, as the members were putting their all into it.

Thud.

Kang Hyun stepped down from the conductor's podium and began walking among the members. Of course, it wasn't that the orchestra couldn't play without a conductor.

In fact, some European symphony orchestras performed without a conductor. But that wasn't what Kang Hyun wanted.

Kang Hyun was walking among the members, pointing out mistakes directly.

'How on earth...'

What kind of scene was this...?

Park Sun-young and the other new members were frozen by the tension and thrill filling the concert hall.

Park Sun-young, who had been a second violinist in the Paris Symphony Orchestra, had never seen or heard of such a rehearsal.

Members of a symphony orchestra had a stronger sense of musical pride and values than anyone else. Even if it were a concertmaster who had been with them for a long time, blatant instructions would be unreasonable.

In fact, in the past, there were many instances where an incompetent conductor was voted out by the orchestra members. But.

"Mirai, you're pressing too hard on the string with your fingers!"

Kang Hyun was different. Park Sun-young looked at Kang Hyun, who was commanding the stage like the back of his hand, and wondered if this was the same Kang Hyun she knew.

Not only did he have an overwhelming aura, but his voice also carried an inexplicable power.

In fact, as soon as they received Kang Hyun's guidance, the orchestra's melody changed immediately.

The guidance was so brief that it was hard to tell what exactly had been adjusted, but the effect was tremendous. It was like watching magic.

"We will take a 30-minute break."

As the conductor stepped down from the podium and walked off stage, the tension that had filled the concert hall finally eased.

The members were busy wiping the sweat from their foreheads with handkerchiefs.

"It's only the first rehearsal, but everyone seems surprised, right?"

At that moment, concertmaster Antonio walked towards the new members sitting in the audience. The new members had many questions, but they hesitated to open their mouths.

Then, Park Sun-young cautiously spoke up to Antonio.

"Concertmaster, do you always rehearse like this?"

Was this common among other conductors too? Park Sun-young had never seen a conductor conducting a rehearsal like Kang Hyun. Even the great maestros found it difficult to manage all the orchestra members.

But Kang Hyun seemed to know every problem of the entire orchestra as if he were looking at a Go board.

"No, we haven't been rehearsing like this for long. It's all possible because of Maestro Hyun. At first, there was resistance among the members, but now, as you can see, everyone acknowledges Maestro Hyun."

As Antonio said, the members were reviewing the scores and revisiting the parts they had just been guided on by Kang Hyun.

The members, who had such strong musical pride, showed not a hint of doubt about Kang Hyun's guidance. It was almost as if Kang Hyun had cast some spell on them.

After another 30 minutes, when Kang Hyun stepped back onto the stage, the endless tension began to fill the room again.

All the members, without showing any sign of hardship, were waiting for Kang Hyun's direction. It was then that Park Sun-young realized. The trust the members had in Kang Hyun was akin to the infinite trust given to a great maestro.

'Can I do it?'

Park Sun-young felt a sense of despair after just one day of work. Even the illustrious senior members had doubts about their skills and were putting in all their efforts as if they were learning music for the first time.

It was truly a survival of the fittest. Now, she understood why there was a common saying that new members couldn't last long in the New York Philharmonic.

If you lacked skill, you wouldn't be accepted as part of the group. Just like that saying, the existing members were not trying to get close to the new members.

In other words, they could leave the New York Philharmonic at any moment.

Even concertmaster Antonio had declared on the first day that he wouldn't stop anyone from moving to another orchestra if they found it too hard.

"Good job today, everyone. See you tomorrow."

When Kang Hyun finished his feedback and got up from his seat, all the members stood up in unison. The members of the New York Philharmonic were truly treating Kang Hyun as a maestro.

Even after Kang Hyun left, the members were sharing his feedback and discussing it among themselves.

"Conductor!"

Park Sun-young followed Kang Hyun as he left the concert hall. At first, she thought about calling him by his name as she used to, but after witnessing today's rehearsal, she realized she couldn't address him the same way anymore.

Kang Hyun turned his head at the familiar voice, and upon recognizing her face, he gave a faint smile.

"Noona, why are you calling me conductor? When we're alone, call me Hyun like before."

"But how can I do that..."

"Did you already forget? You were the one who taught me the violin."

In fact, it was hard to say she taught him. The young Kang Hyun she met already had significant talent for the violin from the beginning.

Even Park Sun-young, who had graduated at the top of the Korean University's music department, had almost nothing to teach him. If anything, she was the one who learned from him.

"Then, Hyun, can I ask you for a favor? Can you guide the new members separately?"

"What?"

She knew it was an unreasonable request. Kang Hyun already seemed busy working with the members.

But Kang Hyun also understood Park Sun-young's thoughts. Normally, she would have sought help from the concertmaster, but with the New York performance just around the corner, it was unrealistic for the concertmaster to take care of the new members.

Moreover, the New York Philharmonic had rarely had the concertmaster guide the new members. This was a place where you either adapted or were left behind.

"Actually, I do have some time. Most of the existing members need their own personal reflection rather than me sticking by their side and guiding them."

Kang Hyun's answer was unexpectedly positive. But his next words made Park Sun-young feel despair again.

"But why should I help the new members at this time?"

It was a reasonable question. Kang Hyun wasn't a conductor who would continue to lead the New York Philharmonic; he was only scheduled for one collaboration.

It was unreasonable to expect him to guide the new members as well. It was like asking him to mind every single tile when he was already fixing the main beam.

At that moment, as if reading Park Sun-young's thoughts, Kang Hyun added.

"No help is given for free. Noona, then you help me once."

"Yooha, is that news true?"

Michelle approached Son Yooha excitedly. It wasn't just Michelle. There were many students behind her waiting for Son Yooha's answer.

The reason why Phillips was so lively was clear. It was because of the rumor that Kang Hyun's New York performance had been scheduled.

"It's probably true."

Son Yooha's short answer added to the buzz.

It was understandable since Kang Hyun's popularity, aiming for the top spot on the Billboard singles chart, was growing among American teenagers as much as any pop star.

Moreover, since he rarely appeared in the media except for his appearance on the Ellen Show, the mystery surrounding him added to his charm.

"Will we be able to get tickets for the performance?"

The topic shifted to the New York performance tickets. The seats in the symphony orchestra hall were limited, unlike the stadiums where pop stars performed for tens of thousands of people.

Considering the number of fans across the United States who wanted to see Kang Hyun, getting a ticket would be as hard as plucking a star from the sky.

'I haven't even received mine yet...'

Michelle glanced at Son Yooha, but she couldn't give a definite answer either.

Son Yooha hadn't seen Kang Hyun's face for two weeks. It was now impossible to eat sandwiches on a bench in Central Park like they used to.

Kang Hyun was busy, and he had become so famous that he couldn't walk around outside properly. Not only paparazzi but also ordinary citizens recognized his face.

"Yooha."

It was after class, as they stepped out of the school.

Son Yooha turned her head at the familiar voice. There stood an unexpected person waiting for her.

"Sun-young unnie?"

It was her former violin tutor, Park Sun-young.

Son Yooha's face lit up with an uncontrollable smile at the reunion after years.

But Park Sun-young was accompanied by people of various races. They were the new members of the New York Philharmonic.

"Ah, Yooha. These people are musicians who perform with me as new members of the New York Philharmonic."

"New York Philharmonic? That's where Hyun oppa is collaborating."

"Actually, I have a huge task today, and so do these friends."

Not only Park Sun-young but also the new members of the New York Philharmonic had determined expressions.

At that moment, a man with his hat pulled low stepped out from among the people. Although his face was hidden, Son Yooha immediately recognized him by his appearance.

"Oppaa?"

It was Kang Hyun. Normally, he wouldn't think of coming outside due to the paparazzi and the crowd, but today was different.

Being among the new members, no one seemed to recognize Kang Hyun. At that moment, he took Son Yooha's hand and pulled her.

"I wanted to meet you outside."

Bringing bodyguards would have been too conspicuous. But walking among ordinary musicians, people didn't pay much attention.

The new members had inadvertently become part of Kang Hyun's date, but none of them complained.

Rather, they were delighted at the chance to receive guidance from Kang Hyun and were eagerly helping the young couple with their date.
