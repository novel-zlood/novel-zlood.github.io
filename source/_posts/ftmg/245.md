The blazing sun of Santa Monica beach shines down on a trilby made of straw with a wide brim.

A middle-aged woman wearing round black sunglasses exudes an air of elegance at first glance. Passersby couldn’t help but glance at her as she sat in the café.

However, it wasn’t just because of her aura. She is the most famous comedian in America.

“Ellen, first of all, congratulations on the 10th anniversary of The Ellen Show.”

The editor sitting across from Ellen handed her a bouquet, offering congratulations.

Ellen slightly removed her sunglasses to check the color of the bouquet, inhaled the scent deeply, and expressed her admiration.

“How did you know I like marigolds and managed to get them for me?”

“Of course, being an ardent fan of yours, how could I not know? I’ve watched every episode of The Ellen Show for the past 10 years without missing a single one.”

“Thank you so much.”

The Ellen Show has become the most famous talk show in America and is renowned worldwide. It’s to the point where not just any celebrity can dream of appearing on it.

There’s even a joke that one shouldn’t claim to be a famous person in America if they haven’t appeared on The Ellen Show, which speaks volumes about its fame.

As proof, guests and airtime were decided based on their popularity.

“Ellen, over the past 10 years, you have participated in the recording of The Ellen Show as a host without missing a single day, even when you weren’t in good health. Especially in the 137th episode with Bill Gates, you conducted the show with an IV drip. Most top stars aren’t that passionate; they’re more concerned about their own well-being. But you seem to have boundless energy, as if you’ve vowed never to miss a broadcast. Where does that drive come from?”

“It’s because of the promise I made to the viewers.”

“A promise to the viewers?”

Ellen nodded briefly.

In fact, when planning The Ellen Show 10 years ago, no one expected it to become such a long-running program. But...

“When I did the first recording, I instinctively knew. I knew this talk show would become a pillar of my life. I made a vow then. No matter what happens, I wouldn’t miss a broadcast. I promised to always spend the evenings with my viewers.”

“If you knew instinctively during the first recording, it must have been quite a feeling.”

“Yes, I can’t forget that day, even though it’s been ten years.”

A handsome young Asian man came to Ellen’s mind. He had become much more famous than her now, as a musician.

“Ellen, I heard the results of the recent viewer poll were quite unique. Is that true?”

“It was very interesting. Viewers voted for the guest they wanted to see the most, and to my surprise, a guest who had already appeared on the show took first place again.”

“Who was the top guest viewers wanted to see?”

“It was the violinist Hyun, the very first guest of The Ellen Show.”

The editor nodded in agreement.

He was also a huge fan who hadn’t missed a single episode of The Ellen Show.

Many celebrities had appeared as guests, but if he had to choose just one, he would pick the violinist Hyun without hesitation.

In retrospect, Kang Hyun was the perfect host for The Ellen Show during its first recording.

“At the time, Hyun’s popularity was so immense within the broadcasting station that some staff suggested making Hyun the host and starting Hyun’s own talk show.”

“I remember that. The popularity of the first broadcast was so overwhelming that Hyun’s New York concert tickets were sold out completely.”

“The scalper prices were higher than Super Bowl tickets. It was shocking. No one expected classical music to gain such popularity in America.”

“That’s right. My nephew was fifteen at the time and couldn’t stop talking about wanting to go to Hyun’s concert. Many kids in America started playing the violin because of Hyun’s influence.”

After the first broadcast of The Ellen Show, Kang Hyun’s popularity skyrocketed. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say he caused a violinist syndrome.

Moreover, it wasn’t a fleeting phenomenon. While some people buckle under the weight of their crown, Kang Hyun was different. He seemed to enjoy the situation leisurely.

“Ellen, may I ask a question?”

“Of course.”

“If you had to choose between the current president, Barack Obama, and Hyun as guests, who would you pick?”

“Why hesitate? If I had the chance, I would definitely want to invite Hyun again. Hyun was the best guest of my life.”

Ellen smiled, recalling Kang Hyun from 10 years ago. His youth was as dazzling as the radiant sunlight of Santa Monica.

“Representative?”

The first to notice the change in popularity was none other than Representative Im Hyera. She called early in the morning, insisting that I always go out with bodyguards from now on.

“Representative? Why all of a sudden? Is it because of the paparazzi?”

I was quite used to paparazzi by now. But if I wore a hat pulled down low and sunglasses, and took routes I didn’t usually take, they weren’t much of a threat. They were just people taking photos, after all. Surprisingly, her answer was different.

“Hyun, did you watch the first broadcast of The Ellen Show yesterday?”

Where would I find the time? I was busy with rehearsals with the New York Philharmonic, barely having a moment to catch my breath.

“It’s a huge deal in America right now. People from major entertainment companies in the U.S. want to come to Korea to see me, and even reporters are flying in. The Ellen Show was a massive hit.”

What nonsense is this? I knew The Ellen Show would become famous in the future, but its first broadcast was a hit? Could it be because of me? As if reading my mind, Representative Im Hyera earnestly cautioned.

“Hyun, there are so many people in America who want to meet you right now. Can you stay in today? What should we do? The impact is so significant that I wish I could fly to New York, but that’s not possible.”

“Representative, Junghoon hyung has a concert in America today.”

“Then make sure to go around with bodyguards. I’ve arranged for a car too, so don’t drive alone like usual.”

It was the day of Baek Junghoon’s concert in America. I was looking forward to it as it was Baek Junghoon’s return to the stage as a pianist after a long time.

But of all days, why did it have to be today? How popular was the first episode of The Ellen Show for Representative Im Hyera, all the way in Korea, to make such a fuss?

Normally, I would have laughed it off, but I couldn’t ignore her sincere advice. Representative Im Hyera, always so cool-headed, had never been this concerned.

However, it became clear when I turned on the TV.

“ABA’s highly anticipated show, The Ellen Show, debuted amidst much excitement. Especially, inquiries about the first guest, violinist Hyun, are flooding in nationwide. People are asking if Hyun’s U.S. concert is already scheduled, and his albums are selling out with premium prices. Notably, Gang Hyun Symphony No.1, which was in the Billboard Top 30, has surged into the Top 10! Let’s watch Hyun’s performance from last night’s episode again.”

Just as the excited announcer said, Kang Hyun’s performance video started playing on the screen.

* * *

Baek Junghoon exhaled the breath he had been holding and relaxed his tense body. It had been a long time since he stood on stage as a pianist. He hadn’t held a concert for a while due to tendonitis.

The reason for the concert in New York was simple. His mentor, Maestro Maxim Ivanov, was currently staying in New York.

“Whew—!”

Baek Junghoon looked down at his long fingers.

How much effort had he put into preparing for today’s concert? He had changed the repertoire countless times and lived on the piano bench as if he were playing non-stop.

It felt like going back to when he first learned to play the piano.

‘Will he come?’

In fact, Baek Junghoon was waiting for just one audience member. The musician and friend who had shown him a new musical worldview and instilled values in him—Kang Hyun.

He had sent a ticket to Kang Hyun, but it was uncertain whether he could make it to the concert hall. After all, Kang Hyun’s popularity in America was beyond imagination.

‘A world star…’

The Korean media had already started openly using the term “world star” to describe Kang Hyun.

No wonder, since no South Korean musician had ever entered the top 10 of the Billboard charts. And he was a violinist. A virtuoso born in Korea, which was considered a barren land for classical music.

“Pianist Baek Junghoon!”

As Baek Junghoon stepped onto the stage, he was met with thunderous applause from the audience.

It had been a long time since he stood on stage as a pianist, not as a conductor. It was a deeply moving experience. Even when he won second place in the Chopin Competition, he wasn’t this nervous. An irresistible thrill coursed through the shoulders of his tuxedo.

As Baek Junghoon bowed deeply to the audience and took a seat on the piano bench, the hall fell silent.

The audience held their breath, eagerly awaiting Baek Junghoon’s performance. They looked on with keen anticipation, wondering what kind of performance he would deliver.

‘Can I do it?’

Baek Junghoon looked down at his fingers, suffering from tendonitis. There was a time when he had almost completely given up on the piano. But thanks to Kang Hyun, he was able to regain his focus.

The collaboration he had with Kang Hyun was still vivid in his mind.

The two performers had connected as if tied by a string, sharing a deep musical understanding.

The melody of the violin and piano intertwined like a waltz.

Thinking of Kang Hyun, Baek Junghoon felt his tense fingers gradually relax.

He even felt a certain excitement. Perhaps because the concert was in New York, it felt as if he was performing with Kang Hyun.

Then, he noticed a peculiar audience member in the middle of the hall.

A deep gaze, like a mesmerizing glissando, met Baek Junghoon’s.

“Hyung, you’ll do great.”

It was an audience member wearing a hat pulled low.

Though the face was hard to see, hidden beneath the deep-brimmed hat, Baek Junghoon recognized the deep eyes under the hat.

It was the one audience member he had been waiting for.

At that moment, Baek Junghoon’s fingers began to dance on the piano keys.
