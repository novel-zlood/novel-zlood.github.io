Kang Hyun had become so proficient that he could communicate with the orchestra members through eye contact without needing to speak.

In the silent concert hall, even the sound of the orchestra members' breathing couldn't be heard; only the breaths of the audience filled the air. Everyone seemed expectant and excited.

As if responding to their anticipation, Kang Hyun's baton sharply cut through the air.

Gang Hyun Symphony No.1

At the same time, a majestic hymn resounded. The prelude of the piece began with the harmony of horns and the tremolo of string instruments.

Like careful footsteps etched in the snow, a cautious melody spread out.

Then, as the conductor's shoulders moved significantly,

Dudududung―!

A grand epic began. The audience couldn't hide their excitement, shaken by the resonating vibrations.

Even the reporters, instead of observing the situation, were absorbed into the stage, becoming one with the audience.

Under Kang Hyun's direction, the massive instrument known as the orchestra moved as one to create the melody.

At the end of the inescapable melody, when Kang Hyun's left hand drew a straight line in the air and clenched, the orchestra momentarily slowed down, creating a gentle wave. At that moment, when the audience swallowed nervously in curiosity,

To reach the sun, to reach the sun, like a rising fantasy―!

From Kang Hyun's fingertips, a majestic hymn echoed. The audience's eyes and ears were captivated by the choir's hymn. It wasn't aiming for the top of the Billboard charts for no reason.

'It wasn't an exaggeration.'

One of the critics, who had never experienced Kang Hyun's conducting, admitted his mistake.

He thought Kang Hyun was simply an outstanding violinist and conductor. But what was this thrill that pierced his entire body?

Listening to a recording and experiencing the performance as an audience were worlds apart. The hymn resonating from Kang Hyun's fingertips stimulated him as if struck by lightning.

It wasn't just one person's story. Even the reporters who occasionally wrote negative articles about Kang Hyun had dumbfounded expressions, as if they were in shock.

Moreover, tonight's performance had just begun. There were still two more symphonies composed by Kang Hyun.

In the flow of the grand melody, the audience prayed with one heart and mind. They wished this moment would never end.

"Whoo―!"

A heavy breath escaped. Though the performance was over, his shoulders were still trembling. He had confidently stood on many stages, but today was the first time it had been so exhausting.

Concertmaster Antonio still couldn't distinguish whether he had dreamed or experienced reality. The other members had similar expressions. That's how enchanting the performance was.

"Where is the maestro?"

"He stepped out briefly for the signing event."

Kang Hyun showed no signs of fatigue until he bowed to the audience after the performance.

Antonio felt immense reverence for Kang Hyun, who was much younger than him. What kind of experience and talent must one possess to show such a performance?

At that moment, Kang Hyun couldn't close his mouth. It was thanks to the audience who had come to the New York Philharmonic Concert Hall.

Not only the audience who had watched the performance but also the people who had waited outside the concert hall until the performance ended formed a line to greet him.

Although a signing event was scheduled, it was limited to three hundred people considering Kang Hyun's condition.

"No matter how you look at it, it seems like way more than three hundred people."

At Kang Hyun's words, the concert hall staff couldn't respond. The traffic around the concert hall was paralyzed. Even the New York police had to step in to manage the crowd flocking to the concert hall.

"Maestro, we'll cut off the line at three hundred people."

"No."

"Excuse me?"

"I'll try to do as much as I can."

There must be many people who had come to the concert hall today, sacrificing their time. Seeing the endless line, Kang Hyun realized his popularity and responsibility.

He noticed a little girl and her parents who had driven for five hours on the highway just to attend the signing event, even though they couldn't watch the performance.

The little girl excitedly kept shouting, "Hyun!" How could he send back those eyes full of excitement?

Three months had passed since the concert in New York ended. The snowflakes that had piled up on the ground were melting, and new sprouts were budding with the early spring energy.

Although it wasn't cherry blossom season yet, the campus was already brimming with the vitality of new students, making it feel like a spring day.

[German Language Department, Class of 00, Kang Hyun, elevates the prestige of Korea University in New York!]

A large banner with Kang Hyun's name and photo printed on it was fluttering prominently at the main gate of Korea University.

Not only current students but also new students were primarily interested in Kang Hyun.

Right after the successful concert in New York, its impact was beyond words. Kang Hyun's symphonies consecutively entered the Billboard charts, and they even sparked a new syndrome called 'Hallyu.'

'It's annoying.'

However, the person in question couldn't handle the annoyance. Although he had left New York and returned to Korea, his life was no different from living in America.

Various media contacts, broadcasting invitations, and commercial offers were flooding in.

Among them, the most proactive was the Minister of Culture's contact.

In a moving car, Im Hyera, sitting in the passenger seat, subtly opened the conversation.

"Hyun, going to receive the Popular Culture and Arts Award feels like..."

"Like a calf being dragged to the slaughterhouse?"

"No, you look like you're being dragged to the dentist by your mom."

"Representative, every time I go and smile for photos, it's exhausting. The people I'm meeting now aren't there to give me an award; they just want to take pictures with me. I'd rather hold a signing event for my fans during that time."

He had already received awards from the government before. Especially when he scored a perfect score in the history of the college entrance exam, he was even called to the Blue House. That day, he took more photos than he would in a lifetime, and he smiled so much that his face cramped.

"Hyun, sometimes you seem like an old soul, but other times you seem like an old man tired of the world."

It wasn't an incorrect expression. Kang Hyun's mental age had already far surpassed that of Im Hyera. At that moment,

"Representative, we've arrived."

At the driver's words, Kang Hyun looked out the car window. The Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism building was visible.

Just like at Korea University, a large banner with Kang Hyun's name was fluttering in the spring breeze. There were even a few reporters spotted at the entrance.

Surely, many more reporters would be stationed in the main auditorium where the award ceremony was to be held.

Kang Hyun relaxed his facial muscles a few times and quickly erased his annoyed expression, replacing it with a faint smile. Im Hyera chuckled at the sight and responded, "You're a pro."

"There's one vacant seat on the judges' panel."

The silence among the greats didn't last long. Russia's Viktor was the first to speak, rubbing his nose.

"I'd like to recommend Nikolai."

"Isn't Nikolai currently teaching at the Moscow Conservatory?"

"He happens to be on sabbatical, so he would gladly accept."

Despite Viktor's assurance, no one readily agreed. Nikolai from Russia was not particularly renowned as a violinist but was quite famous as a professor nurturing future talents. However,

"Viktor, are you sure Nikolai is on sabbatical?"

"Deng Lun, why do you ask?"

China's great Deng Lun stroked his lips and spoke.

"As far as I know, Nikolai was forcibly placed on leave by the school due to severe alcohol dependence. Everyone knows he's a notorious drinker."

Viktor furrowed his brow at Deng Lun's words but didn't deny them. Ultimately, Nikolai was excluded from the candidate list.

Many other greats were named after that. However, they couldn't readily choose one.

There were various reasons. Many renowned greats would refuse the position of judge. They also couldn't appoint someone without the necessary skills as a judge.

The greats from various countries gathered in one place, putting their heads together and pondering deeply.

"Viktor, is Alexei out of the question?"

"He's impossible. Not only is he the head of the Moscow Conservatory, but he also previously served as a judge. He complained quite a bit back then. Asking him to be a judge again would likely provoke a tirade."

It was an undeniable fact. The other greats, aware of Alexei's difficult personality, did not add further comments.

Another long silence followed. Then, the bald French great Hugo spoke with a serious expression.

"The competition that was postponed last year due to unavoidable circumstances."

The first round of preliminaries, conducted with tapes from around the world, had just ended.

Of all times, why did the Queen Elisabeth Competition dinner have to be struck with food poisoning? Several greats who were judges fell severely ill from the food poisoning, as did the participants invited to the dinner. The illness was so severe that the competition had to be postponed to the following year.

"If we delay again because we can't choose the final judge, there will be significant backlash. Viktor, can you really trust Nikolai?"

"Of course. If I see him drinking, I'll give him a stern talking to."

"Hugo, this is a big mistake. I've heard many rumors about Nikolai. If he's appointed as a judge, I'll step down from this position."

"Deng Lun, how can you say something so irresponsible?"

"Viktor, I think appointing an alcoholic as a judge is more irresponsible."

The greats continued their heated debate. To an outsider, it might seem like elderly gentlemen arguing. In reality, these were the greats who ruled the violin world.

At that moment, a white-haired woman who had been quietly observing tapped the table with her long fingers.

"I have someone to recommend."

All eyes turned to Hirose. She was known as the Queen of Strings and held an absolute position in Asia as a violinist.

She was the only active performer among the greats gathered as judges. Though not on stage, she exuded an aura as if she were.

"Hirose, who do you want to recommend?"

There was hope in the eyes of the French great Hugo.

Who was Hirose? She was a virtuoso whose violin skills were second to none among those present. The person she recommended would certainly not be ordinary.

With a faint smile, Hirose spoke.

"Violinist Hyun."
