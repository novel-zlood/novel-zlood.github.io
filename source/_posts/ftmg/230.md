"It was an unexpected question. The audience's eyes turned to the boy with the tousled hair who had asked. Some kids looked puzzled as to why he was asking a violinist such a question.

Kang Hyun nodded briefly and looked at the boy.

"What is your name, student?"

"John Carlyle."

Kang Hyun repeated 'John Carlyle' in his mind. Suddenly, something came to mind.

In his past life, after Dongju Chemical was sold to foreign capital, the lead chemist who developed graphene had the surname Carlyle.

"Graphene is a new material once called the dream material. It conducts electricity over 100 times better than copper and has over 100 times the electron mobility of silicon. Moreover, Dongju Chemical, which succeeded in developing graphene, is making efforts to integrate graphene into various industries. Soon, you will easily encounter graphene applications not only in advanced industries but also in everyday life."

"Does that mean it is stable enough to be integrated into daily life? From what I see, it still appears to be unstable."

"People say benzene, which consists of six carbon atoms in a ring with alternating double and single bonds, is stable. Compared to that, graphene is indeed unstable. It consists of a hexagonal ring structure made purely of carbon. However, Dongju Chemical has found a way to resolve that instability."

The student's eyes widened. It was natural. The method was originally discovered around 2010.

Thanks to Kang Hyun's advanced software, he had subtly hinted at the information he remembered from the graphene development research documents of his past life to Dr. Tikhonov at Dongju Chemical.

Unsurprisingly, the genius had opened countless possibilities from just a small hint.

It didn't take long for Dr. Tikhonov to resolve the instability of graphene.

"Can you teach me the method?"

The student asked Kang Hyun with an earnest look.

"The first thing you need for molecular synthesis is extremely low temperatures. And secondly, your name is John Carlyle, right?"

"Yes?"

"I would like you to visit Dongju Chemical personally and find out. The doors of Dongju Chemical are always open."

It was crucial to gather as many talented individuals as possible. Especially in the chemical industry, where existing chemists lay the foundation and geniuses design the future.

John Carlyle nodded as if he had realized something and sat down.

As expected of students from a prestigious high school, their questions were of a different level.

All their questions were about society, industry, and culture. It was hard to see them as ordinary high school students.

But who was Kang Hyun? In his past life, he was known as a hard worker with an outstanding intellect among prodigies.

Moreover, his advanced software made this level of lecture not nerve-wracking but rather interesting.

At first, the female students who had followed Kang Hyun as a violinist were now visibly impressed by his smooth answers and intellectual level.

Even the renowned students from prestigious Phillips High School were left with their mouths agape at Kang Hyun's responses.

"Yooha, he's so cool—!"

Michelle exclaimed excitedly, patting Yooha on the shoulder. Her eyes were filled with excitement.

It wasn't just Michelle. The female students of prestigious Phillips High School all had their cheeks flushed like autumn leaves.

The reason was simple. Kang Hyun, who was giving the lecture on stage, was incredibly handsome.

'Did I make a mistake asking him?'

Yooha started to feel nervous. She knew Kang Hyun would give a good lecture, but she hadn't expected it to be this good.

Even when the questions weren't about music, he had no trouble answering them. Moreover, he answered not only the students' questions but also the teachers' questions without hesitation.

Many famous personalities had given lectures at prestigious Phillips High School. Most were Ivy League businessmen or local politicians, but none had ever answered questions as meticulously as Kang Hyun.

"Yooha, isn't he a total cheat?"

"Huh?"

"Usually, people who are good at arts aren't good at academics. I had no idea Hyun oppa was this smart."

Michelle looked at Kang Hyun with admiration. Most people only thought of Kang Hyun as a musical prodigy.

But Yooha had known Kang Hyun since childhood. From her perspective, Kang Hyun excelled not only in music but in almost every field of knowledge.

Even if he hadn't pursued music, he would have surely excelled in another academic field. At that moment,

"Before I give you my final words of wisdom, wouldn't it be too disappointing if I didn't perform a violin piece as a violinist? For the bright future of the students of Phillips High School, I will play a violin piece for you."

As soon as Kang Hyun finished speaking, the auditorium erupted in cheers. The female students were already getting up and moving to the front. To an outsider, it would have seemed like a famous singer's concert rather than a lecture.

Soon, Kang Hyun took out his violin from its case. His fluid movements drew gasps of admiration, and everyone held their breath.

'Sigh, I shouldn't have asked him.'

Surely, a massive number of new fans would emerge.

"Are you offering me a contract right now?"

The voice was full of suspicion. The eyes looking over the contract were filled with wariness.

Manager Kim Sang-guk recited his prepared comment as always.

"Our VH Company is investing in Mr. Cotton's future. The contract may seem unfair and look like charity from VH Company, but if Mr. Cotton proves his worth and succeeds in his business, all these issues will resolve naturally."

"Investing in my future, you say?"

"Yes, our CEO highly values Mr. Cotton's abilities."

"I've heard of VH Company. It's known for making absurd investments, but I'm at a loss for words to receive such an offer myself."

Indeed, nine out of ten people reacted like Cotton. Initially, they were wary, thinking it might be a scam, but eventually, they ended up signing an investment contract with VH Company.

It was a natural progression. Even a person with no legal knowledge could see that the contract terms were favorable.

In essence, the risk for the investee was minimal even if the business failed. Yet,

"But I will decline this investment offer."

"Excuse me? Mr. Cotton, what do you mean?"

"Initially, I was tempted by VH Company's offer to invest in my business. I currently lack funds to the point where I have set up an office in a container used for storage."

"Then, accepting our proposal would solve that issue, wouldn't it? We at VH Company can provide the necessary funds. Please consider it an investment in your future."

"That's exactly why I can't accept it."

Cotton firmly shook his head.

"I know my future better. Unless there are better terms, I will decline this investment offer."

Manager Kim Sang-guk was at a loss for words. The investment terms offered by VH Company were incredibly favorable to the investee.

Did Cotton really know his future? Or was he just greedy?

Manager Kim Sang-guk was silent for a while. It was a first. Then,

"Mr. Cotton, may I speak with you?"

A young man with a neat appearance appeared next to Manager Kim Sang-guk. With a face that could be mistaken for an Asian actor, his mysterious and deep eyes captured Cotton's attention instantly.

The young man smiled lightly at Cotton and said,

"Let me formally introduce myself. I am Hyun, the CEO of VH Company."

"So, Mr. Kang Hyun, are you saying that the field of portable nanochips I'm developing has no potential?"

"I'm not saying it has no potential. I'm saying the development direction is wrong."

"Could you explain in detail?"

The more Cotton talked with Kang Hyun, the more he felt like he was sinking into a swamp.

How could a young man who looked much younger than him know so much about the field of nanochips? Moreover, his knowledge of other IT fields was also substantial.

"The field of portable nanochips that Mr. Cotton is developing has already attracted major companies worldwide. Although you started as an early leader, you will eventually be pushed back due to a lack of manpower and resources. If you hadn't ventured into portable nanochips, what would you have researched and developed?"

"It would probably still be the field of portable nanochips. But with the current technology, it's impossible, so I had postponed it."

"Our VH Company would like to fully support Mr. Cotton's development of portable nanochips."

"Wait a minute. Do you even know what you're talking about when you say portable nanochips?"

Kang Hyun nodded briefly and recited what he knew.

Most of it was information he had seen in passing in an IT column in his past life. Thanks to his advanced software, he could now remember even fleeting moments.

Perhaps because of that, Cotton's eyes widened as Kang Hyun continued speaking.

"Even now, you won't sign an investment contract with our VH Company?"

Cotton couldn't refuse as firmly as he had before.

Manager Kim Sang-guk watched the scene with great interest. Kang Hyun had instantly captivated the genius known as an eccentric.

Even Cotton, who had maintained a confident attitude, now looked somewhat anxious. At that moment, Kang Hyun nodded and stood up.

"Alright, let's consider today's meeting as if it never happened."

"W-wait—!"

Cotton hurriedly stood up, looking desperate, and grabbed Kang Hyun's hand.

"Alright. I will sign an investment contract with VH Company. But please answer one question."

"Of course."

"Who exactly are you?"

It was pure curiosity. Cotton, a genius in the field of nanochips, was utterly impressed.

Kang Hyun answered without hesitation.

"I am Hyun, the CEO of VH Company."
