"Chairman, have you been well?"

Kim Sang-guk visits the grand mansion in Pyeongchang-dong at the beginning of every month. Ostensibly, it was to inquire about Chairman Wang's well-being, but his true intention was different. He needed time to give regular reports to Chairman Wang.

"I heard Hyun is investing in IT?"

"Yes, Chairman."

"By now, his skills would have been revealed. How is he doing?"

The chairman sipped his tea, showing a curious expression.

However, Kim Sang-guk only gave a faint smile without a specific answer. Considering he was now an executive at VH Company rather than the head of the Strategic Planning Office, it was a natural reaction.

"Manager Kim, you shouldn't keep things from me. If you do, there might not be a place for you in the Strategic Planning Office later."

"If that is your will, there is nothing I can do."

"That's why I like you, Manager Kim."

The chairman smiled contentedly. He had never seen anyone who didn't bow to his will. But Kim Sang-guk never wavered in his beliefs in front of anyone. Especially since he started working with Kang Hyun, his demeanor had completely changed.

"Manager Kim, do you know that you've changed a lot since you started working with Hyun?"

"Are you talking about me?"

"Yes, you were as stiff as bamboo when I first met you, but now you've become as flexible as a reed."

"Flexible like a reed... Honestly, looking back on the past two years, it's truly amazing."

Kim Sang-guk shared his personal thoughts rather than business matters. The chairman's eyes sparkled as if he was listening to an interesting old story.

Most of what Kim Sang-guk talked about was related to Kang Hyun. Over the past two years, there had been many significant and trivial events while managing VH Company.

"At first, I didn't trust Hyun's choices. I thought of him not as an owner but just a young client introduced by you. Every time he drew up an investment plan, he would sketch out a blueprint for me as if it were nothing. Initially, I couldn't understand it."

"You couldn't understand?"

"The contents of the blueprint were so absurd. As someone from the Strategic Planning Office, I couldn't comprehend the continuous series of ideas. At first, I thought he was a child having fantastical dreams due to excessive attention. But as time passed, I realized."

Each time Hyun's blueprint matched reality, Sang-guk was left speechless.

Eventually, as all the puzzle pieces fell into place with Hyun's blueprint aligning with the future, he felt a thrill throughout his body.

It was clear that the boy had an insight that couldn't be matched by experience or age.

"It was the first time I had such an astonishing experience. But Hyun continued to act as if it were nothing. Since then, I started to serve Hyun not as a mere client but as the owner of VH Company."

Sang-guk was curious about Hyun's future. Despite having numerous experiences, nothing was as thrilling as being with Hyun.

Starting with Chairman Barbara's gold mine to the blueprint of the IT industry, it was as if he was part of a historical scene. What would the future hold? Just then,

"He must have arrived at the Blue House by now."

The chairman picked up the remote and turned on the TV in the reception room.

On the screen was Hyun, dressed in a suit. Instead of looking youthful, he exuded the aura of a confident young entrepreneur.

His eyes were so intense that it was hard to believe he was just a student who had recently taken the college entrance exam.

* * *

Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine that receiving a commendation live on national broadcast would attract such public attention.

Despite the national interest due to the commendation at the Blue House, Hyun's focus was solely on the upcoming solo concert a month later.

As evidence, melodies resonated day and night at the Concert Hall of the Seoul Arts Center.

"Once more, please."

Hyun frowned. The reason was simple. He wasn't satisfied with the piano accompaniment.

Although the pianist was well-known in Korea, playing skill and synchronization were separate matters.

Especially since Hyun's compositions required the violin and piano to breathe and contrast as if pushing and pulling each other.

"Again."

Sweat began to form on the pianist's forehead. They had been practicing non-stop for half a day already.

Even though the notes were played exactly as written on the score, Hyun's frown often deepened as if the musical symbols were out of place.

Synchronization with a collaborator isn't achieved overnight. The more sensitive the musician, the longer it takes, so it wasn't entirely the pianist's fault.

"Again."

This time, the pitch was off. The pianist's long fingers, slick with sweat, pressed the keys too deeply.

Now, the pianist's face was filled with dissatisfaction. He was a renowned musician in Korea, after all.

By age and years of learning music, he was a senior to Hyun by far.

"Again."

The notes flowing from his stiff shoulders were shaky. For a pianist, controlling dynamics was crucial, and synchronization was absolute.

The pianist felt like he was dying. Keeping up with Hyun's breathing was too overwhelming.

In the end, the pianist took his hands off the keys.

"Hyun, I don't think I can do it. My shoulders and fingers won't move the way you want them to."

"Can't you try just a little more, senior?"

"No, I want to stop. I know you're brilliant. But the more I practice, the more I find myself envying and resenting you instead of blaming my inadequacies. I think it would be better to find another pianist. For a perfect solo concert, I shouldn't be the accompanist."

The pianist nodded his head as if he had already given up. Hyun couldn't persuade him any further. He saw the firm resolve in his eyes.

Only Hyun remained in the concert hall where the pianist had left.

Finding a suitable piano accompanist immediately was like plucking a star from the sky.

"Baek Jung-hoon."

Of course, if Baek Jung-hoon were here, he wouldn't have this dilemma. But he was currently in Russia learning to conduct.

Asking him to play the piano again, when he had chosen the path of a conductor, would be impolite.

While Hyun was deep in thought,

"You're really here?"

A familiar voice echoed. A figure gradually walked onto the stage, as if they had made an appointment.

Seeing the person who appeared as if by fate, Hyun widened his eyes.

"Senior Kwon contacted me a few days ago, saying he was struggling to keep up with your solo concert's accompaniment."

"Hyung?"

"I told you, I'm the only pianist who can withstand your rigorous lessons. You should've contacted me from the start. Leaving a friend who syncs well like this."

Baek Jung-hoon finished speaking and sat on the piano bench. At that moment, Hyun felt as if he had gained an army.

Baek Jung-hoon gave a faint smile and signaled.

Now, it's time to sync up.

"Driver, please take me to the Seoul Arts Center."

The taxi driver was startled and glanced at the rearview mirror. The foreigner's Korean pronunciation was quite fluent.

Throughout the journey to the Seoul Arts Center, the driver couldn't stop praising the passenger's Korean skills.

Adam Whishaw, the chief editor of Gramophone, smiled and chatted with the taxi driver.

"Is your girlfriend Korean by any chance?"

"No, I'm still single."

"You speak Korean so well that I thought you learned it from your girlfriend."

A few years ago, after meeting Hyun for the first time, Adam became deeply interested in Korea.

In the past, Korea was considered a barren land for classical music in Asia. At that time, Japan was the leading country in classical music in Asia.

However, a series of unbelievable miracles had occurred in this barren land.

Starting with pianist Baek Jung-hoon and leading up to violinist Hyun.

Hyun's emergence, in particular, was enough to stir the entire classical music world.

From his comet-like debut on the violin, engraving numerous melodies, to conducting the London Symphony, his spectrum was undeniably vast.

It's no wonder Gramophone's first critic showered praises on Hyun's first album.

"Why did you come to Korea for Christmas?"

"To receive a gift."

"A gift?"

The taxi driver looked puzzled. What kind of gift would make someone fly all the way to Korea?

"By the way, the road to the Seoul Arts Center is quite congested. Is there an event today?"

"There is a very special performance."

A solo concert that would be engraved in classical music history was about to unfold. Every vehicle heading to the Seoul Arts Center was filled with eager anticipation.

Just then, snow began to fall outside the car window. The beautiful snowflakes seemed to be celebrating the Christmas miracle.

* * *

All 2,523 seats in the concert hall of the Seoul Arts Center were filled with the audience.

It had been a long time since the concert hall brimmed with such excitement. The audience's eyes sparkled with excitement and anticipation.

Judging by appearances alone, there were as many foreigners as there were Koreans in the audience.

The reason they had flown to Korea was simple. They came to see one person.

Not only had he set Korea ablaze, but he had also ignited the hearts of classical music fans worldwide.

The conductor Karas, known as the Empress of Austria, had once said that she felt as shocked seeing Hyun's first album as when she first saw Mozart's score.

Moreover, Hyun's new compositions were set to be revealed at this solo concert, so everyone was filled with great expectations.

"Reporter Kim, is it really true?"

"It is. Not only Hirose but also Baek Jung-hoon will be performing at the solo concert."

"Hirose is confirmed, but isn't Baek Jung-hoon in Russia?"

Rumors that both Hirose and Baek Jung-hoon would be performing at Hyun's solo concert made the reporters salivate.

After all, it had been years since Baek Jung-hoon had played as a pianist.

"I heard that EMA's representative is also here for the solo concert."

"Is that verified?"

"Yes, some people even saw him at the Gwanghwamun Hotel. Apparently, he came to negotiate Hyun's second album contract."

Journalists in the music industry knew how reluctant the representative of EMA, a prestigious European classical label, was to travel. For him to come to Korea for Hyun spoke volumes.

Not to mention the EMA representative, but the audience was also filled with prominent classical figures.

From chief conductors of famous orchestras to internationally recognized Chinese pianists and Europe's renowned violinists, all of whom had packed schedules, they had taken the time to come to Korea.

For those in the classical music field, their visit was an unparalleled honor.

Just then,

Click.

Hyun, leading the way like an escort, and Hirose, dressed in a red gown, followed behind. The murmuring audience fell silent.

Hyun looked at the vast audience. He knew why they were so excited. It was because both Fantasia and Euphoria had made their appearance.

'Teacher.'

They had become so in sync that they could understand each other just by looking into each other's eyes.

The first greeting to the audience would start with the duet performance of the two.

As Fantasia and Euphoria faced each other and were placed on their shoulders, it felt as if a wind was blowing through the concert hall.

At that moment, the bow slowly lifted.
