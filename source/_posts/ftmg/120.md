"Old man, what do you eat to stay so fit?"

Summer had arrived at the foot of Bukhansan Mountain.

"Have you been hiding a pretty old lady somewhere? You seem like you've returned to your younger days."

"Songa, you say the darnedest things. My grandson insisted on healthy dieting and regular check-ups. The doctor says I'll live to be a hundred, so there's no need to worry."

"There were only two times in my life when I was jealous of you. First, you have a photo with your late wife, and second, Hyun. No matter how I look at it, you were born blessed with grandchildren."

Chairman Wang also ate all sorts of health foods, but he couldn't compare to Chairman Yoo's stamina.

They were already climbing the steep hillside, but instead of getting out of breath, their steps seemed to grow firmer. Anyone seeing them might think they had just passed forty.

"Let's rest here for a moment."

The two old men sat down on a stump in front of a tree that split into two trunks.

Looking at their attire, they seemed like typical grandfathers who enjoyed hiking. Who would guess they were renowned figures in South Korea?

After sharing some health drinks that were good for the bones:

"Songa, you did it on purpose, didn't you?"

"Old man, what are you talking about?"

"The bet you proposed to Hyun."

Of course, Chairman Wang wouldn't have made such a proposal to Kang Hyun without a reason. Chairman Yoo, who had been with him for many years, knew his heart.

As green leaves fell to the ground:

"Old man, you know it too. Hyun isn't a materialistic child. If he were only smart and talented, would I have made such a proposal to a high school kid? Even Manager Kim, who is stingy with praise, can't stop talking about Hyun. That's why I was worried."

"Worried?"

"Yes, I was worried that he might lose interest in management later on. The two-year timeframe is just formal. No matter how foolish Bum Kyung is, he wouldn't want to lose his shares to a high school nephew. The higher the goal, the higher the ideal. As an adult, I just set a goal for a talented child."

Chairman Yoo seemed to remember something and spoke:

"But if Hyun really secures Dongju's shares within two years, will you actually give them?"

"Compensation, you mean? If he does it, of course, I'll give them—!"

Chairman Wang chuckled. No matter how outstanding Kang Hyun was, there were limits. Both he and Chairman Yoo had them. Even looking back at Son Ilseon's high school days, it was the same.

The two old men resumed their climb to the peak. Upon reaching the summit of Bukhansan and looking down at Seoul, Chairman Wang abruptly said:

"Who will be the owner of that land in the future?"

* * *

Achoo—!

They say even dogs avoid summer colds, but it seems I caught one. My nose tingles, and it feels like it'll last a while.

Outside, it felt like walking on a sizzling frying pan due to the early heatwave, but inside the gallery, it felt like mid-winter.

It was the era when air conditioners were being popularized. Hard to find in ordinary homes, but rich houses were different.

"Hyun-ah, your studio is always nice. Just lying on the sofa with an ice cream bar, it feels like Hawaii. No need to go all the way to Bugok."

Of course. Baek Junghoon had started using my studio as if it were his own room.

In my past life, he left a strong impression as an iron-blooded maestro, but now he felt more like a neighborhood hyung with nothing to do. Still, he wasn't annoying.

"Hyung, instead of that, can you accompany me after finishing that ice cream? The synthesizer doesn't give the feel I want."

"Who am I to refuse? Still, there's no one in Korea who composes analog like you, Hyun. Even with all this digital equipment. By the way, you're going to London next week, right?"

"Yes, the London Symphony already knows."

Baek Junghoon's eyes showed clear regret. I knew why. He always helped with my practice and composition.

I knew how much he wanted to go to London and Berlin. They were home to the world's top orchestras, attracting the best virtuosos.

Trying to hide his disappointment, Baek Junghoon joked:

"By the way, I planned to go to Gyeongpodae or Haeundae for vacation with you this summer, but that's not happening."

"Vacation?"

"Yeah, every time I see you, you're holed up in your studio composing. Anyone would think you were possessed by Mozart's ghost. At least Mozart enjoyed socializing; you don't."

Come to think of it, had I ever gone on a vacation in my past life?

In my school days, I was nicknamed 'the fanatic,' always carrying a study guide as my friend. Even as I got older, I was the same. I pursued success and ambition until my body was sick and withered.

If given the chance, going on a vacation might not be a bad idea.

"By the way, what happened with your album? I heard EMA contacted you."

"I'm planning to meet with them in London. I'm curious about their thoughts."

"Wow, my little brother is doing something I haven't done yet."

EMA was a renowned classical label in Europe. They showed great interest in my compositions from my solo recital.

Their love calls were so persistent that I received international calls three times a day. Speaking of which—

"Hyung, remember when I said I'd give you a piece?"

"Huh? What?"

"I said I'd give you a piece back then. Take a look. No matter how well it's composed, it has to suit the performer."

When I casually handed the sheet music to Baek Junghoon, his eyes widened in surprise.

He didn't expect me to keep my word from a passing remark. As he examined the sheet music, his throat bobbed.

But then, licking his dry lips, he shook his head.

"Hyun-ah, as much as I want to, I can't accept it for free this time."

"Who said it was free?"

"Huh?"

I slipped another piece of paper to Baek Junghoon.

It was a contract stating he'd help with my practice when I had no schedule in Korea. Of course, there were no hidden clauses. After all, hadn't I practiced law for several years?

And there was one more condition.

"Master this piece within a month. Then I'll really give it to you."

By the time I return from London and Berlin, a month would have passed. Then I could see how Baek Junghoon interpreted the sheet music.

If it didn't suit him, I'd take it back. Though I doubt that would be necessary.

"Hyun-ah, are you going to stay up all night composing in your studio again today?"

"Probably, yes."

At that moment, Baek Junghoon's eyes lit up, and he suddenly looked at me.

"Can I sleep here tonight?"

* * *

"Who will go to greet Hyun?"

Ripples formed on the calm lake.

"Of course, I should go. I was the closest to Hyun in Korea."

"Emanuel, what are you talking about? I was the closest to Hyun. Do you know how attentively he listened to the orchestra history I taught him?"

"Michael, you taught him that a hammer was used as a percussion instrument in the Romantic era. Do you know how bored Hyun was?"

Principal cellist Emanuel and timpanist Michael glared at each other, bickering.

The other members, having witnessed such scenes countless times, just shrugged it off.

Then, the quiet violist Chloe raised her small hand and softly said,

"Th-then should I go?"

At the Barbican Hall, the heart of the London Symphony, the members gathered for rehearsal.

But their focus was not on the symphony they were about to rehearse but on a young boy who would arrive soon.

Those who had been to Asia for the tour accepted the situation as natural, but the newly joined members were different.

‘What's going on?’

Christine couldn't understand. The London Symphony members boasted impressive skills, befitting their reputation. Moreover, their musical pride was sky-high. It was hard for newcomers to even get a proper look from the principal members. But here they were, so excited.

‘An apprentice?’

It was said that, unusually, an apprentice from Asia would spend two weeks with the symphony. The term "apprentice" itself was unfamiliar, and who could be coming that they'd be so eager to greet?

Even the cold-eyed concertmaster, known for his aloofness, seemed stirred. Then,

"I can't take it. Let's all go together!"

Finally, Emanuel made a decisive move, standing up. He looked like a general ready for a desperate battle.

Who would've thought the Barbican Hall would be this heated over an apprentice arriving in a week?

"By the way, is that rumor true?"

"What rumor?"

"The one about Hyun solving all of Chappelle's riddles."

Dmitri nodded briefly. He had heard the rumor too. It was said that Hyun had solved the riddles that no one in Chappelle's history had ever solved.

"Emanuel, riddles?"

Michael, who hadn't heard the rumor, asked curiously. Emanuel, with exaggerated gestures, began to tell the story.

It was so intriguing that even those who seemed uninterested perked up their ears.

"What? He found all the mistakes in the symphony? In one go? Concertmaster, do you think this is possible? Does Chappelle really give such tricky riddles?"

Dmitri, too, had experienced Chappelle in his youth. Unfortunately, he hadn't found a single mistake. But Hyun reportedly found all the errors. It sounded like a legend.

"Shall we test it?"

Emanuel, with a mischievous smile, looked at the new members.

A seasoned orchestra can perform a symphony without a conductor. The interpretation and tempo might differ, but the performance is possible. The London Symphony is one of the world's top orchestras.

They seated the new members like an audience and began to play. Concertmaster Dmitri's bow signaled the start.

"I don't know. Can we have one more chance?"

They had made mistakes, but none of the new members found them.

Christine felt a surge of frustration but tried to suppress it. She couldn't understand why the senior members were acting this way, including the usually dignified concertmaster.

No matter how perfect one's pitch, how could one instantly find errors in a symphony's movements?

"Hmm, shall we try again? This time, we'll make it easier to find."

No matter how they lowered the difficulty, it was an impossible task.

The performance resumed, but it was still baffling. Even if they had memorized the score, they wouldn't find it in one go.

In the end, the new members surrendered. Emanuel shook his head and stood up.

"Isn't Hyun's reputation exaggerated? How can anyone find this? Even as a performer, I couldn't tell. None of the new members can sense which part is wrong?"

As everyone fell silent,

"Horns—!"

Someone shouted. Emanuel was startled, his eyes widening. The person had correctly identified the prearranged mistake. Other members were equally surprised.

Then, another exclamation filled the hall. Two figures entered the Barbican Hall.

As the shadows faded, the voice's owner became clear.

"Hyun?"

For some reason, Kang Hyun was walking in with Maestro Spencer.
