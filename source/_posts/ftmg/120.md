“You old man, what on earth do you eat to have such stamina?”

Summer had arrived at the foot of Bukhansan Mountain.

“Are you hiding some pretty old lady from me? It’s like you’ve gone back to your younger days.”

“Son, you say the darnedest things. I’ve been sticking to a healthy diet and getting regular health checkups because my grandchild kept pestering me about it. The doctor said I’d live to be a hundred, so no need to worry.”

“There have been exactly two times in my life when I envied you. First, that you have a photo with your late wife, and second, Hyun. No matter how I see it, you are blessed with a wonderful grandchild.”

Chairman Wang also ate everything that was good for his health, but his stamina was nowhere near Chairman Yoo’s.

They had been climbing the steep mountain slopes for a while, but instead of getting out of breath, his steps seemed to grow steadier. Anyone who saw him would think he had just passed forty.

“Let’s rest here for a moment.”

The two old men sat on a stump in front of a tree with branches splitting into two.

From their attire, they looked like typical old men who loved hiking. Who would know they were prominent figures in South Korea?

After sharing a drink of bone-strengthening golisu, they continued their conversation.

“Son, you did it on purpose, didn’t you?”

“Old man, what are you talking about?”

“Suggesting the bet to Hyun.”

Of course, Chairman Wang wouldn’t have made such a proposal to Kang Hyun without a reason. And Chairman Yoo, who had known him for many years, understood his intentions.

As the green leaves fell to the ground,

“Old man, you know Hyun has no greed for material things. If he were just bright and intelligent, would I have made such a proposal to a mere high school student? Even Chief Kim, who is stingy with compliments, can’t stop praising Hyun. That's why I was worried.”

“Worried?”

“Indeed, I was worried he might lose interest in management in the future. The two-year period is just a formality. No matter how foolish Bumkyung is, he wouldn’t lose his shares to a high school nephew. The higher the goal, the higher the ideals. As an adult, I just set a target for a talented kid.”

Then Chairman Yoo seemed to recall something.

“But would you really give Dongju’s shares to Hyun if he secured them all within two years?”

“The reward? If he manages to do it, I will―!”

Chairman Wang smirked. No matter how brilliant Kang Hyun was, there were limits. Both he and Chairman Yoo had experienced them. Even looking back at Son Ilsung’s high school days, it was the same.

The two old men continued their climb to the peak. As Chairman Wang looked down at Seoul from the top of Bukhansan, he suddenly spoke.

“Who will be the owner of that land in the future?”

Achoo―!

They say even dogs avoid summer colds, but I seem to have caught one. My nose feels stuffy, and it seems like it will last long.

Outside, the early heatwave made it feel like walking on a hot frying pan, but the gallery was as cold as winter.

That's because air conditioners were becoming common. It was hard to find them in regular homes, but it was different for the wealthy.

“Hyun, your studio is always great. Just lying on the sofa with a popsicle in your mouth feels like Hawaii. No need to go all the way to Bugok.”

Of course. Now, Baek Junghoon used my studio as if it were his own bedroom.

In my previous life, he had left a strong impression as a maestro, but now he was more like a neighborhood hyung with nothing to do. Still, I didn’t dislike him.

“Hyung, instead of just eating the popsicle, could you help with the accompaniment? The synthesizer doesn’t capture the feeling I want.”

“Who could say no to you? In Korea, no one composes analog like you do, Hyun. Even with all this digital equipment. By the way, you’re going to London next week, right?”

“Yes, the London Symphony already knows.”

Baek Junghoon’s eyes showed clear regret. I knew why. He had always helped with my practices and compositions.

I knew how much he wanted to go to London and Berlin. They were home to the world’s top orchestras, where the best virtuosos gathered.

Baek Junghoon tried to hide his disappointment with a playful tone.

“By the way, I wanted to go on a summer vacation to Gyeongpo or Haeundae with you, Hyun, but I guess that won’t happen.”

“Vacation?”

“Yes, you’re always locked up in your studio composing. Anyone would think you’re possessed by Mozart's spirit. At least Mozart enjoyed socializing, but you don’t.”

Come to think of it, did I ever go on a summer vacation in my previous life?

In my school days, I was called a study freak and always had my study guide as a friend. It was the same even as I aged. I ran towards success and ambition until my body became sick and withered.

If I get the chance, a vacation might not be a bad idea.

“Oh, and how’s your album going? You said EMA contacted you?”

“I’m meeting them in London. I’m curious about their thoughts.”

“Wow, you’re doing something I haven’t done yet.”

It was a prestigious classical label in Europe. They showed great interest in my compositions from my solo concert.

Their love calls were so fervent that I received international calls three times a day. By the way.

“Hyung, I mentioned it before.”

“Huh? What?”

“I said I’d give you a piece. Take a look. No matter how well it’s composed, it has to appeal to the performer.”

I handed the sheet music to Baek Junghoon, and his eyes widened.

He didn’t expect me to keep a promise I made in passing. As he slowly examined the sheet music, his Adam’s apple bobbed.

However, he soon licked his dry lips and shook his head.

“Hyun, I can’t accept this for free.”

“Who said it’s for free?”

“Huh?”

I slid another piece of paper to Baek Junghoon.

It was a contract to help with my practice in Korea when he had no other schedules. Of course, there were no tricky clauses. After all, I had been a lawyer for several years.

There was one last condition.

“Master this piece within a month. Then I’ll give it to you for real.”

By the time I returned from London and Berlin, a month would have passed. I could check how Baek Junghoon interpreted the sheet music then.

If he wasn’t the rightful owner, I could take it back. Though I doubted that would happen.

“Hyun, you’re going to stay up all night composing in your studio again, right?”

“Probably.”

At that moment, Baek Junghoon’s eyes sparkled as he suddenly looked at me.

“Can I sleep here tonight?”

* * *

“Who will pick up Hyun?”

Ripples spread across the calm lake.

“Of course, it should be me. After all, I’m the closest to Hyun in Korea.”

“Emanuel, what are you talking about? I’m the closest to Hyun. Do you know how carefully he listened when I taught him the history of the orchestra?”

“Michael, you told him that a hammer was used as a percussion instrument in the Romantic era. Do you know how bored Hyun was?”

Principal cellist Emanuel and timpanist Michael glared at each other, bickering.

The other members, who had witnessed this countless times, just looked resigned.

Then the quiet violist Chloe raised her small hand and spoke softly.

“Th-then, should I go?”

At the Barbican Hall, the heart of the London Symphony, the members were gathered for rehearsal.

However, their focus wasn’t on the symphony they were about to rehearse but on a young boy who would soon arrive.

Those who had toured Asia accepted the situation as a given, but the new members who had recently joined were puzzled.

‘What on earth is going on?’

Christine couldn’t understand. The London Symphony members had remarkable skills, befitting their reputation. Their pride in their musical artistry was unrivaled. For new members, even looking at the principal members was daunting. Yet, they were all so excited.

‘A prospective member?’

It was said that an unprecedented prospective member from Asia would be with the symphony for two weeks. The term “prospective member” itself was unfamiliar, and she couldn’t fathom why everyone was so eager to greet this person.

Even the normally stoic concertmaster, known for his cold demeanor, seemed visibly excited. Then,

“That’s it, let’s all go out together―!”

Emanuel finally decided, standing up. He looked like a general ready for a fierce battle.

Who would have thought the Barbican Hall would be so heated over a prospective member who would arrive in a week?

“By the way, is that rumor true?”

“What rumor?”

“The one about Hyun solving all of Chappelle’s puzzles.”

Dmitri nodded briefly. He had heard the rumor too. It was said that Hyun had solved the puzzles that no one in Chappelle’s history could complete.

“Emanuel, what puzzles?”

Michael, who hadn’t heard the rumor, asked curiously, and Emanuel, with grand hand gestures, started explaining the rumors about Hyun.

The story was so captivating that even those who seemed uninterested perked up their ears.

“What? How did he find all the mistakes in the symphony? In one go? Concertmaster, does this even make sense? Did Chappelle really give such tricky puzzles?”

Dmitri recalled his younger days at Chappelle. Unfortunately, he hadn’t found a single mistake. But Hyun had supposedly found all the errors in the symphony. It sounded like something out of a legend.

“Shall we test it?”

Then Emanuel, with a sly smile, looked at the new members.

A seasoned orchestra can perform a symphony without a conductor. The interpretation and tempo might differ from usual, but it was possible. Especially for the London Symphony, one of the world’s top orchestras.

The new members were seated like an audience while the regular members began playing. The concertmaster Dmitri’s bow signaled the start of the piece.

“I don’t know. Could you give us another chance?”

Although mistakes were intentionally made, none of the new members could find them.

Christine was frustrated but tried to contain it. She couldn’t understand why the senior members were acting this way, especially the concertmaster who usually exuded authority.

No matter how perfect one’s pitch was, how could someone identify mistakes in the symphony’s movements?

“Hmm, shall we try again? This time, I’ll make it easier.”

No matter how much the difficulty was lowered, it was an impossible task.

Even as the symphony played again, it remained a mystery. Even if one had the score memorized, it would be hard to spot the errors.

In the end, the new members admitted defeat. Emanuel shook his head and stood up.

“Could Hyun’s rumors be exaggerated? How could anyone find these mistakes? Even I wouldn’t catch them if I didn’t know. Does any new member have any clue which part was wrong?”

Everyone remained silent,

“French horn―!”

until someone shouted loudly. Emanuel’s eyes widened in surprise. The part he had intentionally made a mistake in was accurately pointed out. The other members were equally astonished.

Then, more gasps were heard as two figures entered the Barbican Hall.

As the shadows receded, the person behind the voice came into view.

“Hyun?”
