“It seems to be a lack of direction.”

Tommy’s expression showed a hint of confusion. On the other hand, Professor Albert nodded briefly in agreement.

Tommy looked at me with teary eyes, as if his freckles were about to fall off.

It seems that I need to give a bit more explanation.

“The piece Tommy just performed is Schubert's Arpeggione Sonata. Originally composed for the arpeggione, a string instrument similar to the cello, but that’s not the important part right now. Schubert suffered from severe depression and mental illness in his later years. He even said that he wished he wouldn't wake up from his dreams every morning. That intense trauma is deeply embedded in the Arpeggione Sonata.”

Studying composition allowed me to understand this better.

Just looking at the notes on the staff, it was clear what kind of mindset Schubert had when composing this piece.

Despair, sorrow, and confusion were mixed, leading the sonata of despair.

A majestic yet beautiful melody, but if you look deeper, you can feel a desperate cry.

Some even described it as the scream of a woman in distress.

“Tommy is a performer with a high level of understanding of the piece. His bowing and string melodies try to capture Schubert’s emotions better than anyone else. However, understanding the composer’s mind and improving as a performer are separate issues, I think.”

“Hyun, what do you mean by separate issues?”

“Tommy, if there were a Schubert competition, your performance of the Arpeggione Sonata would undoubtedly captivate the judges instantly. But evaluating a performer’s skill is different. The practice room is not a competition hall, you don’t need to perform just like a long-dead composer.”

It’s a matter of form and route.

Studying with Teacher Deoksoo sparked my interest in the philosophy of fate and destiny.

Isn't there a saying that all things return to their origin? Though the paths may differ, I thought music and philosophy resonated as one.

It may be an exaggerated expression, but at this rate, even if Tommy wins competitions, he will not progress as a musician.

“From the composer’s perspective, would they want a performer centuries later to play their piece exactly as they did? I don’t think so. In music, a composer is just a craftsman who makes a mold. It’s up to the performer to decide how to fill it. Tommy, you must have tried very hard to understand Schubert’s mind.”

He must have practiced a hundred times. Otherwise, he couldn’t have performed such a perfect Arpeggione Sonata.

“That’s why, even though you performed a perfect Arpeggione Sonata, you didn’t complete your own performance. Let me ask you one thing. Tommy, do you want to excel as a performer, or do you want to become Schubert?”

At that moment.

Clap, clap, clap, clap―!

Professor Albert clapped his hands and nodded.

“As Emanuel said, you’re amazing. To pinpoint the issue in an instant.”

“Professor, are you referring to Emanuel, the principal cellist of the London Symphony Orchestra?”

“Yes, he’s an old friend of mine. When he heard you were entering the Royal Academy of Music, he couldn’t stop praising you, so I was very curious.”

At that moment, Professor Albert leaned forward and asked.

“Hyun, have you ever thought about learning the cello?”

* * *

A week passed.

“Hyun, how is life at the Royal Academy of Music?”

At Principal Samuel’s question, I put down my teacup.

“I’m already familiar with the inside of the school, but the students still give me cold looks. It feels like they’re looking at a stranger.”

“A stranger…”

“Especially, I wanted to meet with the violin students, but as you know, it’s the Queen Elizabeth season, so there was no time to exchange musical knowledge. The professors also seemed quite busy. Thanks to that, I had the experience of studying other orchestral parts instead of the violin.”

“Since you suddenly came as an exchange student in the middle of the term, the students and professors probably didn’t have time to pay attention to you. As you know, the Queen Elizabeth competition means everything to them.”

It was a natural thing. With a once-in-a-lifetime competition ahead, would they even notice an exchange student?

But there was something unexpected. I’m the youngest winner of the Queen Elizabeth competition, after all.

You’d think someone would come to ask me about the Queen Elizabeth, but no one did.

Well, there’s nothing I could particularly teach them.

‘Talent.’

At that time, I won not through splendid technique or practiced skill, but through musical talent.

Compared to other participants who challenged the competition with grand dreams, I originally did it to get an exemption from military service.

“The curriculum of the Royal Academy of Music maximizes student autonomy. Especially during competition periods, there may be individual lessons with professors, but no group classes are held. Therefore, the violin students are probably holed up in their practice rooms.”

“Are most of the violin students challenging the Queen Elizabeth?”

“Of course. Even though you are the youngest winner, it seems you don’t fully understand the prestige of the Queen Elizabeth competition. For musicians, the current era is more difficult than the medieval times. There are many opportunities to make a name, but geniuses from all over the world gather in one place. In the classical world, it’s important to have a platform to showcase one’s skills. That’s why many unknown musicians desperately challenge competitions. Moreover, competitions have age limits, so if they don’t challenge them in their twenties, they miss the chance forever. Older students are making their last attempts.”

It felt like cold water was poured over my head. I seemed to have a naively beautiful perception of the Queen Elizabeth competition.

It’s a truth no one had ever told me. Well, the masters around me weren’t fixated on competitions anymore.

‘A chance to make a name.’

Principal Samuel’s words made me realize how many musicians wanted to make a name for themselves.

No wonder some musicians continue to chase competition venues even after achieving results.

In the classical world, not in popular music, fame was of utmost importance.

It was only natural to chase competitions. For them, music was life and, at the same time, a livelihood.

At that moment.

“By the way, Hyun, why don’t you meet Sabrina?”

“Sabrina?”

“She’s a violin genius recognized by the Royal Academy, but she’s famous for not showing herself. If she were to challenge a competition, she would win, just like you. But for some reason, she avoids public appearances.”

It was a name I’d never heard before. Even after recalling memories from my past life, there was no violinist named Sabrina.

However, seeing Principal Samuel speak so confidently, she must not be an ordinary person.

“If you meet Sabrina, it will be very beneficial for both of you.”

* * *

Knock, knock.

I opened the door to the sound of knocking early in the morning.

“Tommy?”

It was Tommy, who hadn’t shown up for the past week.

Hadn’t he been avoiding me even during meal times since then? Because of that, I had to explore the school alone with just a pamphlet for company.

Tommy, with a face full of freckles, teared up and then lowered his head.

“I’m sorry, Hyun. I wanted to find you, but my silly pride wouldn’t let me.”

“No, Tommy. You don’t need to be sorry, but just know this. I had no intention of belittling you. But why are you here so early? Are you going to show me around the school?”

“No, the principal asked me to help you find Sabrina.”

“Sabrina?”

“Yes, she’s a hard person to see even within the school. She never shows herself to strangers. She’s not called the White Witch for nothing.”

Is she a reclusive genius?

But what does he mean by the White Witch?

“Tommy, can you tell me what you know about Sabrina?”

“Actually, I don’t know much either. I’ve only seen her a few times. She’s my senior, but younger than me. I think she’s fifteen now?”

“Fifteen?”

“Yes, she entered the Royal Academy of Music at the youngest age. I heard that the former principal, the Queen, personally enrolled her when she was seven. That’s how talented she was. There were even rumors among the professors that she would dominate the future of the violin world. But for some reason, she hasn’t played the violin in public since enrolling.”

Could it be true? Entering the Royal Academy of Music at seven. A genius of that level should have made a name for themselves.

But even after recalling memories from my past life, I couldn’t find any trace of a violinist named Sabrina.

“She’s probably playing the violin now.”

“You said she doesn’t play in front of people?”

“I know a place where she practices alone. I found out by chance.”

Tommy took my hand and led me outside the dormitory building.

Didn’t we walk for quite a while? Passing through the vast garden of the Royal Academy of Music and heading into the forest path connected to it. We must have walked for a good thirty minutes.

Rustle, rustle.

Leaves soaked with morning dew danced as the autumn wind shook them. How long did we walk?

Shh!

Tommy put his index finger to his lips. It meant to be quiet. He even treaded very carefully.

When the sound of the stream flowing through the forest sounded like an accompaniment.

Ziiing.

A clear resonance pierced my ears. Soon, a breathless tremor and sorrowful continuation flowed through the bow as the wind blew once more.

Bach’s Partita No. 2, Chaconne.

Just listening to it, the continuous melody made all five senses feel ecstatic.

Through the dense foliage, a figure playing in the middle of the forest appeared.

Her fingers pressing the strings under the shimmering dawn were long and transparent like pure white.

The performance changed, as if speaking of a scream within sorrow.

Ziiing―!

Even the birds in the forest kept silent, appreciating the girl’s performance.

Starting with a high note that seemed to reach the sky, her bold bowing shook the forest.

Rustle, rustle, rustle.

The dew-laden leaves seemed to be enjoying themselves, touching heads together.

Under the burning dawn, her silver hair was revealed. It seemed as if the forest was responding to her performance and moving.

Nature provided the accompaniment, and her melody penetrated it completely. It felt like an orchestra’s performance.

My throat moved involuntarily. In an illusion that time had stopped, the dense foliage danced once again, making me realize.

Rustle, rustle, rustle.
