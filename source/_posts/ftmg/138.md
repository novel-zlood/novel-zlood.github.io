"Do you feel your popularity?"

It was a difficult question.

"I don't know yet. I know that critics and journalists have given us many good reviews, but it seems it will take some time to feel the reactions of numerous audiences directly."

Popularity is always relative. Moreover, it was too early to make a quick judgment since only the press screening had been completed.

Nevertheless, the reactions around were hot. Especially, the professors from the Juilliard School, who had watched the film in advance, were more enthusiastic than ever.

"The usually reserved professors came to me right after the movie ended and asked how the actor Alessandro played the violin so well. They probably didn't know about simultaneous recording because they were elderly professors unfamiliar with the film production system."

No wonder Alessandro's left-hand fingerings and fierce bowing skills were enough to surprise many, as if he were playing himself. Kang Hyun had personally taught Alessandro throughout the filming.

"When I told them that violinist Hyun personally did the simultaneous recording and played Paganini's sheet music, one of the professors exclaimed, 'Are you talking about the Mozart of Brussels?' I learned that violinist Hyun was called the reincarnation of Mozart at an international competition held in Brussels several years ago."

Jean-Pierre still felt a cold sweat on his forehead when he thought of that day. He was more nervous than when he faced sharp questions from any critic.

The elderly professors, who seemed uninterested before the movie started, were all eagerly asking questions with sparkling eyes.

"The professors at Juilliard wanted to meet violinist Hyun immediately. But unfortunately, that wasn't possible. I asked them to attend the party held a week later, as violinist Hyun would return from LA by then."

Jean-Pierre didn't know the reason why Kang Hyun suddenly went to LA.

Right after the press screening, many journalists wanted to interview Kang Hyun, who was in charge of the simultaneous recording, but he left for Hollywood less than an hour later.

As Kang Hyun was hurrying out of the press screening hall, he left a curious answer to Jean-Pierre's question.

"He said he was going to make a friend."

Barbara Tannenbaum.

As the founding chairman of the Barbara Group, one notable point is that his surname, Tannenbaum (fir tree), indicates he is Jewish.

Originally rooted in the Saxony region in southeastern Germany, they are heavily involved in the mining industry.

It's said that they crossed over to the United States through Denmark, which was a border area, to escape Nazi persecution. He named his company 'Barbara' instead of 'Tannenbaum' for this reason.

"My parents entrusted me, who was a newborn baby at the time, to a relative and were taken to the Dachau concentration camp. That was the only way for our family to survive. After the fall of the Nazi regime, my parents came out of Dachau, but my mother, who was frail, contracted typhus and passed away a few years later."

It was because his motherâ€™s name was also 'Barbara.' This was well-known information. Later, a movie about Barbara Tannenbaum's life was even produced.

Before reaching the age of twenty, he started to influence the mining, railroad, and real estate industries in the land of opportunity, America, through the unique brainpower of Jews.

"In America, I always doubted people and read their thoughts. Many of the people who approached me coveted my money and status. Once I reached a certain position, clumsy drifters couldn't even approach me anymore. But to think I'd get a business proposal at today's lunch. I'm very curious about what it will be."

Barbara put down his teacup and smiled faintly.

"Hyun, what are the three reasons I should do business with you?"

His eyes were stormy and flashing.

'He'd be comparable to the old snake.'

In some ways, both men were similar. They were the ones who landed on the land of opportunity with scars and built history.

But there was no hesitation here.

"First, the outlook for Barbara Mining is not bright. I know that there has been a lot of talk within the group about stopping mining due to years of exploration failures and management difficulties."

Barbara leaned forward at the unexpected story.

"Second, however, you don't want to give up the mining business. Because of that, you have stretched your hand into real estate, circulating the deficit occurring in Barbara Mining with the capital from real estate and railroads. Why do you, a thorough and cold-headed chairman, want to maintain the historically declining mining business?"

It was because the mining industry was the origin of the Barbara Group.

Moreover, it was the first business undertaken by his parents, who were taken to the concentration camp for his sake. It wasn't a matter of business deficit as an entrepreneur. In a way, it was to preserve his parents' spirit.

"Third, you asked me what I wanted. What I want is simple. It's to send Barbara Mining's exploration team to the location I desire. If you send them there, Barbara Mining's problem will be solved."

Operating an exploration team requires a considerable amount of money. But it was not comparable to a million dollars, as it was simply a geological survey.

However, most of the costs were known to be spent on resolving political issues with the developing country in question.

At that moment, Barbara looked at me with a mysterious expression.

"It's amazing. If I sum up what you said, it sounds like you know of an exploration area that can save Barbara Mining from its deficits."

"That's right."

"What?"

It was exactly the place Barbara Mining would discover three years later. How much noise did it make in the world as the blessing of the millennium? It was even prominently featured in the news headlines in faraway Asia.

It was quite famous in the legal field as well. Why? Because of the legal dispute between the government and Barbara Mining over the discovered mining area. I also studied the case history thoroughly as an example of overseas disputes.

Barbara stared into my eyes for a long time.

"My father always said until he closed his eyes. Get close to someone whose eyes are as clear as a lake and as deep as an ocean. Even if Hyun's words are a lie, that's fine. I was already planning to grant you a wish equivalent to a million dollars. But I want to ask. What is buried there? Copper? Nickel? Zinc? Or is it silver?"

Of course, I wouldn't have come to Barbara for something trivial. Something as splendid as the flower of mining was buried there.

"Gold."

Isn't that a brilliant name?

"Julia Roberts of 'Pretty Woman'!"

Parties never felt familiar to me, whether in the past or now. It felt like wearing a tuxedo that didn't fit.

On the other hand, Director Kim Sang-kook was visibly excited, unlike his usual cool demeanor. It must have been a novel experience for him, seeing so many famous Hollywood actors.

"I didn't know Director Kim liked this kind of atmosphere."

"Do you think I always enjoy having dinners drenched in sweat with the tie-wearing crowd? Sometimes you need to get some fresh air to break the monotony of social life. No, I don't know what I'm saying to you, Hyun. I'm being foolish."

Yes, I also extremely disliked enjoying drinks with just men.

When I was at the Western District Prosecutor's Office in my past life, I used to follow the senior prosecutor up the mountains every weekend and soothe my burning throat with makgeolli.

Back then, I never dreamed that I would be enjoying a party among Hollywood actors like this.

"Hyun, Demi Moore from 'Ghost'!"

Although it was a party to celebrate the successful press screening of the movie 'Paganini,' all the donated funds were said to be used to help the needy, so many famous Hollywood figures attended.

There were also well-known tycoons in Hollywood. It was a social gathering indeed.

"Hyun!"

At that moment, Director Jean-Pierre came to me with a warm greeting.

"Many people want to see you, Hyun."

"Me?"

"Yes, you're the other main character of this movie."

Led by Director Jean-Pierre, I had to go around and greet people here and there.

Anyone would think I was like a son who got accepted into a prestigious Korean university, being introduced all around the neighborhood during a holiday.

After going through many groups, the last place Director Jean-Pierre led me to was where some elderly gentlemen were. I heard they were professors from the Juilliard School.

'I seem to be building a lot of connections with music professors.'

In Moscow and now at Juilliard, I didn't expect to be so warmly received.

It was when I was having an in-depth discussion on how to interpret Paganini's sheet music. The oldest-looking professor looked at me and made a request.

"Violinist Hyun, if it's not too much trouble, could you play a piece here? After watching the movie, Paganini's melody keeps lingering in my mind, and I can't sleep properly. I know it's a rude request, but please understand this old man's excited heart."

* * *

Ziiing.

The bow glided over the strings, producing a soft and rich melody. The noisy party hall instantly fell silent.

Everyone was looking at a single performer, as if it were a salon of European social circles.

The continuous serious tones were unbelievable for Paganini's sheet music. But it was a performance that made one clench their fists more than any other melody.

The evidence of this was that the eyes of the elderly professors were already filled with tension.

The bowing was as cautious as expressing a tree swaying in the wind.

Kang Hyun's left fingers moved up and down the fingerboard as if they were sliding without relaxation.

Even though it was an impromptu performance, everyone became excellent listeners, holding their breath as if it had been prearranged. At that moment.

Ziiingâ€”!

When the bow pressed the strings strongly, a fierce melody reached the ceiling.

Paganini Caprice No. 24.

The previous calmness was like the calm before the storm, as the bowing fiercely expressed the prelude.

It was a series of intense melodies that were hard to believe were produced by a single person.

The techniques of bowing with the bow and plucking with the left fingers' pizzicato were unbelievable even when seen with the eyes.

The long fingers performed flageolet and double-stop techniques as if they had been waiting. In the dazzling techniques, the bow and strings clashed as if competing with each other.

It was almost like one violin had turned into two.

Slam.

The elderly professor from earlier stood up, clenching his fists.

The melody, which seemed to pierce through the lungs, had shaken his musical sensibility. The evidence was the rapture filling his wrinkled eyes.

Even though the performer's bow pointed to the floor, no one opened their mouth first.

Although it was an unprepared performance, everyone seemed to be immersed in a long afterglow. Even the famous actors who frequently attended social parties were no different.

There were cases where musicians performed at parties, but it was the first time they had received such a shock. Had there ever been a time when they felt so breathless from listening to the melody of an instrument?

"As rumored, you're truly amazing, violinist Hyun."

A professor from Juilliard held Kang Hyun's hand. His face was visibly excited. Moreover, he made a large donation at this party.

Those who heard Kang Hyun's performance all began to increase their donation amounts. It was, in a way, a performance for a charity event.

The face of the party organizer showed a mixture of joy and difficulty at the same time.

"Director Jean-Pierre, may I make a donation too?"

At that moment, a mysterious man took out a check and handed it over. Jean-Pierre's eyes widened as he looked at the number written on the blank check.

He couldn't believe it and rubbed his eyes with his sleeve before checking the number on the check again.

"One million dollars?"

"Yes, that's right. It's the price for listening to violinist Hyun's performance."

Finally, Jean-Pierre confirmed the man's face. He was a person often seen in Forbes magazine. And he was accompanied by bodyguards.

Even the famous Hollywood actors lost their presence in front of him, like fireflies before the sun.

Although this was a party where any famous person in Hollywood could attend, he never imagined this person would come.

He approached Kang Hyun, who had finished his performance.

"It was a very good performance."

"Thank you, Barbara."

"I have always become friends with those I wish to connect with, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. The first report from the exploration team sent to the exploration area came in. At first, I couldn't believe it. But I remembered your eyes. Those deep eyes filled with conviction."

Barbara smiled and continued.
