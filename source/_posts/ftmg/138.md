"Do you feel the popularity?”

It was a difficult question.

“I still don’t know well. I’m aware that critics and reporters have given a lot of positive feedback, but it will take quite some time to directly feel the reactions of numerous audiences.”

Popularity is always relative. Moreover, it was too early to make a judgment as only the premiere had been completed.

Nevertheless, the reactions around were intense. Especially, the professors from the Juilliard School of Music who had watched the movie in advance were more enthusiastic than ever.

“The dignified professors immediately came to me after the movie ended, asking how the actor, Alessandro, could play the violin so well. These old professors who were not familiar with the movie recording system probably didn’t know about the existence of synchronous recording.”

That was understandable because Alessandro's skills with his left-hand fingering and fierce bowing made it seem like he was playing himself, enough to surprise many. Throughout the filming, wasn’t it Kang Hyun who directly taught Alessandro?

“When I mentioned that violinist Hyun performed the synchronous recording and played Paganini’s sheet music, one of the professors exclaimed, ‘Are you talking about the Mozart of Brussels?’ It turns out that violinist Hyun was called the reincarnation of Mozart at an international competition held in Brussels several years ago.”

Jean-Pierre still felt a cold sweat on his forehead when he recalled that day. He was more nervous than when he received sharp questions from any critic.

The old professors, who seemed disinterested like cattle led to a slaughterhouse until the movie began, all lit up their eyes and bombarded him with questions.

“The professors from Juilliard wanted to meet violinist Hyun immediately. Unfortunately, that was not possible. I told them to attend the party a week later. By then, violinist Hyun, who had gone to LA, would be back.”

Jean-Pierre didn’t know the reason why Kang Hyun suddenly headed to LA.

Right after the premiere ended, numerous reporters wanted to interview Kang Hyun, who had performed the synchronous recording, but less than an hour later, he left for Hollywood.

As Kang Hyun hurriedly left the premiere hall, he left a peculiar answer to Jean-Pierre’s question.

“He said he was going to make a friend.”

Barbara Tannenbaum.

As the founding president of the Barbara Group, a notable point is that, as the name Tannenbaum (fir tree) suggests, she is Jewish.

Originally rooted in the southeastern state of Saxony, Germany, she was greatly involved in the mining industry.

She reportedly fled to the United States through Denmark, a border area, to escape Nazi persecution. The reason she named her firm 'Barbara' instead of 'Tannebaum' was this.

“My parents entrusted me, then an infant, to a relative and were taken to the Dachau concentration camp. It was the only way for our family to survive. After the Nazi regime collapsed, my parents came out from Dachau, but my mother, who was weak, caught typhus and didn’t survive for many years.”

Her mother’s name was also ‘Barbara.’ It was well-known. A movie depicting Barbara Tannenbaum's life was even made later.

Before even reaching adulthood, she began to influence the mining, railroad, and real estate industries in the land of opportunity, America, using the unique brainpower of the Jewish people.

“In America, I always doubted and read people’s minds. Many among the numerous people approaching me coveted my money and status. Now that I’ve reached a certain position, petty wanderers can’t even approach anymore. But today, I didn’t expect to receive a business proposal at lunch. I’m very curious about what will be proposed.”

Barbara put down her teacup and smiled faintly.

“Hyun, what are the three reasons I should make a deal with you?”

Her eyes gleamed like a storm.

‘Comparable to the old serpent.’

In a way, both of them had similarities. They were people who landed in the land of opportunity and made history while bearing scars.

But there was no thought of hesitating here.

“First, the prospects for Barbara Mining are not bright. I understand that there is a lot of talk within the group about stopping mining due to continuous exploration failures and management difficulties over the years.”

Barbara leaned forward at the unexpected story.

“Second, however, the president does not want to give up the mining business. As a result, you have stretched into the real estate business, circulating the deficit from Barbara Mining through the capital from real estate and railroads. Why does a thorough and cold president try to maintain the historically declining mining business?”

Because the mining industry was the very foundation of Barbara Group.

Moreover, wasn’t it the industry that her parents, who were taken to a concentration camp for her, first ventured into? The management deficit as an entrepreneur was not the issue. It was in a way to preserve the spirit of her parents.

“Third, you asked if I had any wishes. What I wish for is simple. It’s to send Barbara Mining’s exploration team to the area I want. If you send them there, the problem of Barbara Mining will be solved.”

Operating an exploration team costs a considerable amount. But it was not comparable to a million dollars, as it was simply a geological survey.

However, most of the cost was known to be spent on resolving political issues with the developing country concerned.

At that moment, Barbara made a peculiar expression and looked at me.

“It’s amazing. From what you’re saying, it sounds like you know an exploration area that can save Barbara Mining, which is struggling with deficits.”

“That’s correct.”

“What?”

Precisely, it was a place Barbara Mining would discover three years later. It was a sensation that made the world buzz, being called the blessing of the millennium. It even made headlines in news across the distant Asia.

It was quite famous in the legal community as well. Why? Because there was a legal dispute between the local government and Barbara Mining over the discovery of the mining area. I also studied the case overview thoroughly as an example of overseas disputes.

Barbara stared into my eyes for a long time.

“My father always said before closing his eyes. He told me to stay close to someone with eyes as clear as a lake and as deep as an ocean. Even if what you say is a lie, it’s fine. I already intended to grant you a wish equivalent to a million dollars. But I must ask. What is buried there? Copper? Nickel, zinc? Or is it silver?”

Of course, it wasn’t something trivial that I sought Barbara for. It was something that could be called the flower of mining.

“Gold.”

Isn’t that a brilliant name?

“Julia Roberts of Pretty Woman!”

For some reason, I still don’t get used to parties, whether then or now. It feels like wearing a tuxedo that doesn’t fit.

On the other hand, Chief Kim Sang-guk’s face was evidently excited, unlike his usual cold demeanor. It must have been a unique experience as famous Hollywood actors were attending.

“I didn’t know you liked this kind of atmosphere, Chief Kim.”

“Do you think I always enjoy sweating it out with the tie-wearing crowd at company dinners? Sometimes you need to get some fresh air to break the monotony of social life. No, I don’t even know what I’m saying to you, Hyun. It’s absurd, absurd.”

Indeed, I also hated enjoying company dinners with just men.

When I was at the Western District Prosecutor’s Office in my past life, didn’t I soothe my burning throat with makgeolli while hiking with the chief prosecutor every weekend?

Back then, I never dreamed I would enjoy a party like this among Hollywood actors.

“Hyun, Demi Moore of Ghost!”

The party was to celebrate the successful premiere of the movie ‘Paganini,’ but all the money donated in name would be used to help the underprivileged, so many celebrities from Hollywood attended.

There were even wealthy individuals recognized by Hollywood on one side. Indeed, it was a social gathering.

“Hyun!”

At that moment, Director Jean-Pierre came to see me happily.

“There are many people who want to meet you.”

“Me?”

“Yes, you are the other protagonist of this movie.”

Led by Director Jean-Pierre, I had to greet people here and there.

Anyone would think it’s like a parent introducing their son who got accepted into a Korean university during a holiday.

After going through many groups, the last place Director Jean-Pierre led me to was a group of elderly gentlemen. I heard they were professors from the Juilliard School of Music.

‘Why do I often build connections with music professors?’

It was the same in Moscow, and I didn’t expect to be so warmly welcomed even at Juilliard.

We were having an in-depth discussion on how I interpreted Paganini’s sheet music when the eldest-looking professor looked at me and made a request.

“Violinist Hyun, if it’s not too much trouble, could you play a piece here? After watching the movie, Paganini’s melody has been lingering in my mind so much that I can’t sleep properly. I know it’s a rude request, but please understand this old man’s excited heart.”

* * *

Ziiing.

The bow glided over the strings, producing a soft and rich melody. The noisy party hall instantly became quiet.

Everyone was watching a single performer, as if in a European social salon.

The continuous serious tone, hard to believe it was Paganini’s sheet music. Yet, it was a performance that made one clench their hands more than any other melody.

The proof was that tension was already filling the eyes of the elderly professors.

The bowing expressed the swaying of trees in the wind, gently moving over the strings.

Kang Hyun’s left-hand fingers slid over the fingerboard as if without relaxation.

Despite the sudden performance, everyone became excellent listeners, holding their breath as if by agreement. It was then.

Ziiing—!

When the bow pressed the strings strongly, a fierce melody reached the ceiling.

Paganini Caprice No. 24.

The previous peace seemed to express the calm before the storm, with the bow fiercely bowing.

It was a series of intense melodies, hard to believe produced by a single person.

The pizzicato technique, plucking with the left-hand fingers while bowing with the right, was unbelievable even when seen.

The long fingers showed off harmonics and double-stop techniques, as if the bow and strings were competing against each other in a brilliant display of skill.

It felt like one violin turned into two.

Snap.

The elderly professor from earlier stood up, clenching his hands.

The melody, as if tearing through the chest, had shaken his musical soul. The proof was the ecstasy filling his wrinkled eyes.

Even though the performer’s bow pointed downward, no one spoke first.

Despite the unplanned performance, everyone seemed lost in a long afterglow. Even the famous actors who frequently attended social parties were no different.

Although musicians often performed at parties, it was the first time they had been so shocked. Had there ever been a time they felt so breathless listening to an instrument's melody?

“Indeed, it’s amazing, as the rumors say, violinist Hyun.”

An elderly professor from Juilliard shook hands with Kang Hyun. His face was evidently excited. Moreover, didn’t he donate a huge sum at this party?

Those who heard Kang Hyun’s performance started to increase their donation amounts. In a way, it was like a performance event for the charity event.

The party organizer’s face showed mixed joy and difficulty.

“Director Jean-Pierre, may I also make a donation?”

At that moment, a mysterious man handed over a check. Jean-Pierre’s eyes widened as he looked at the amount written on the blank check.

He rubbed his eyes with his sleeve in disbelief and checked the numbers on the check again.

“A million dollars?”

“Yes, that’s right. It’s the value of hearing violinist Hyun’s performance.”

Only then did Jean-Pierre look at the man’s face. It was a familiar face from Forbes magazine. Looking closely, he even had bodyguards with him.

Even the famous Hollywood actors lost their presence before him like fireflies before the sun.

Although anyone could attend the party if they were a famous Hollywood personality, dreaming of this person’s attendance was beyond imagination.

He was approaching Kang Hyun, who had finished his performance.

“It was a very good performance.”

“Thank you, Barbara.”

“I have always become friends with those I wanted to connect with, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. I received the first report from the exploration team sent to the exploration area. At first, I couldn’t believe it. But then your eyes came to mind. Those deep eyes filled with conviction.”

Barbara smiled faintly and continued.

“Hyun, will you be my friend?”
