Sizzle sizzleâ€•!

The richly marbled meat was grilling to a golden brown on the hot plate, making my mouth water. Adding a shot of soju to this would be the perfect finishing touch.

However, the atmosphere at the dinner table was reminiscent of a tense first meeting between in-laws. Two stern-looking individuals were staring each other down intensely.

"This is Korean beef made from native cattle. I don't know if it will suit your taste, but the quality and flavor are excellent. I hope the maestros enjoy it."

At that, the two stopped their staring contest and focused on the meat. Interestingly, despite both being Westerners, they were highly skilled with chopsticks.

Of course, having performed with orchestras worldwide from a young age, they must have experienced all kinds of exotic dishes.

"Hyun, I don't know if we deserve such hospitality."

"It's nothing. The maestros came all the way to Korea to see me, so treating you to a meal is the least I can do."

"Thank you for saying that."

Anticipating this, I had brought a corporate card. The restaurant had an elegant exterior and was known for hosting many politicians. I had visited this place a few times in my past life.

I wondered if Director Im Hyera would be surprised at the card bill. After the meal, it was time to choose a post-meal tea.

"Hyun, I'll have Ssanghwa tea."

"Pardon?"

"Remember the tea you served me and the maestro last time? Dmitri also loved it, said it was similar to mulled wine."

I never expected to be enjoying Ssanghwa tea with foreigners. As their teacups were almost empty, Yuri spoke first.

"I'll get straight to the point. Hyun, are you still considering the offer I made two years ago to join us?"

"Maestro Yuri, I'm sorry, but I remember making the same offer. And I met Hyun first, didn't I?"

"Maestro Spencer, I apologize, but musicians have different orchestras that suit their talents. Joining an orchestra isn't about who asked first; it's Hyun's choice."

Spencer furrowed his brows, and Yuri raised an eyebrow. It was like watching a clash of titans.

With their overflowing charisma and stern expressions, the restaurant waitress was trembling as she served.

Anyone watching might mistake this for a mafia boss meeting rather than a conversation between maestros.

"Ahem, Maestro Spencer, how long will you be staying in Korea?"

"Why do you ask?"

"As far as I know, you have a symphony performance in London soon. I didn't realize you had so much free time. You'll be heading back to London soon, right? As for me, I'm on a sabbatical, so I have plenty of time."

Spencer's face tightened. It seemed Yuri's words were true. The tension was palpable, and unless I intervened, it felt like it would never end.

Just as I was about to interject, Spencer turned to me and said,

"Then, Hyun, promise me this."

What?

"If you don't come to London, don't go to Berlin either."

* * *

'London and Berlin.'

Any musician would be envious. The overwhelming love calls were enough to make my head spin.

Maestro Spencer kept urging me until the day he left. If I went to Berlin without telling him, I felt he might chase me down and kick my butt.

Knowing the maestro's temperament, it wouldn't end with just a kick.

"We've arrived, Kang Hyun."

Mr. Kim's voice snapped me out of my thoughts. I had grown to enjoy leaving school in my uniform. The reason was simple. In exchange for helping music students, I was excused from classes.

"Hyunseon, when you play the keys, your left fingers are too tense compared to your right. And if you look at the score for the second movement, it says 'Adagio cantabile.' You need to play it slowly, like singing. Structurally, the movement starts lyrically, becomes passionate, and ends lyrically again. But your performance feels abrupt."

It's like changing lanes slowly with a turn signal in a car, but suddenly switching from the third lane to the first without signaling.

"Thank you, Hyun."

The students took my feedback well. I pinpointed the issues quickly, so it was only natural.

Surprisingly, many students were into classical music. There were dozens of them. If it weren't for the well-equipped Jeil Middle School, they wouldn't have all been accommodated.

"Hyun, could you check my posture for a moment?"

It was a male student specializing in violin. Although we were in the same grade, I rarely saw him as I hadn't been to school often.

"Jinho, I'd like you to relax your grip when you draw the bow. Your melody is too stiff right now. It's like you're trying not to miss a single note on the staff, with your eyes on fire. You're excluding any emotion. Fixing your posture can come later."

This issue arose when focusing solely on completion. Without emotion, the melody isn't music. Nonetheless, Jinho followed well. If he didn't have potential and skill, I wouldn't have given such harsh feedback.

"Jinho, may I ask why you're so dedicated to playing the violin?"

He stayed after school every day to practice. I heard he was also good at academics.

But when he played the violin, it was as if his life depended on it. His determination was comparable to professional violinists.

"I want my parents to acknowledge me. My father hates me playing the violin."

Some adults have an aversion to music, even classical music.

Moreover, the times are uncertain. In a situation where you don't know when you'll escape the foreign exchange crisis, it's hard for parents to wholeheartedly support their child pursuing an instrument.

'Hmm.'

It had been a week since I started checking the music department students' postures.

Most of them were preparing for various competitions in December. They were children of renowned companies.

There were even students defying their family's opposition to focus on music, which was impressive. Each one had a lively sparkle in their eyes.

"Would you consider performing at your graduation? There's quite some time between the competitions and the graduation."

Nobody responded. It seemed like a waste. Such talented performers shouldn't be left idle. Moreover, it was a perfect opportunity to showcase their skills in front of their parents.

"Hyun, we did consider it, but there are quite a few of us. How can so many people perform together?"

At that moment, Kim Jinho spoke up.

As he mentioned, the students played various instruments. From violins to cellos, clarinets, flutes, and even double basses.

The string section was already nearly complete.

"Why think that way?"

The students looked at me, dumbfounded. Adjusting some instrument compositions was all it took. The solution was simple.

"You can all perform together."

"Hyun is truly gifted."

Chairman Wang's voice echoed in the reception room, full of excitement.

"But I wonder if I might lose my future son-in-law to an orchestra."

"Since when did Hyun become your son-in-law?"

"Haha, in-law. Wasn't it decided when we first met? We agreed to marry off our grandchildren."

Did they ever make such a promise? Chairman Wang smiled slyly and sipped his tea.

"By the way, it's been days since he arrived in Korea, and he hasn't come to see his grandfather yet?"

"In-law, you know how busy Hyun is these days."

Of course, renowned maestros from abroad came to see Hyun. Despite that, Chairman Wang's expression didn't soften.

Suddenly, Chairman Wang's lips curled into a smile. Chairman Yoo knew what that expression meant.

"Are you planning to tease Hyun?"

"Of course. He's making me worry, so I need to make him realize how much he needs his grandfather."

"Our Hyun isn't easily swayed. You know that. He's a kid who sees several moves ahead."

As Chairman Yoo mentioned, there were countless times he was amazed by his grandson.

Especially his understanding of Korea's market economy was so impressive it was almost eerie. Didn't the government hide the fact about the bailout?

But Chairman Wang was no ordinary person either. He's not called a titan of the business world for nothing.

"In-law, tell Hyun this."

"What should I tell him?"

Chairman Wang's face filled with mischief.

"The most unfair thing in the world is taking back what you gave."

"Are all these sheet music pieces composed by violinist Hyun?"

The lion of the Berlin Philharmonic, Yuri, couldn't hide his pure admiration.

He was usually expressionless. But seeing all these sheet music pieces, he couldn't help but be amazed.

Yuri had to discard his previous thoughts. It was a clear misjudgment.

Violinist Hyun hadn't been idle for the past two years.

"Unbelievable."

Names of legendary composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Vivaldi flashed through Yuri's mind.

The sheer number of sheet music pieces created in two years was astounding.

And their quality? Every note on the staff was so meticulously crafted that it was beyond words.

"May I watch you compose for a moment, if it's not too much trouble?"

"Of course, Maestro."

Hyun nodded without hesitation. He was never a sensitive artist. Hadn't Baek Jeonghoon dropped by the studio regularly?

Moreover, thanks to upgraded software from his past life, Hyun's concentration was unmatched.

How much time had passed?

Like Mozart, who composed masterpieces while sipping tea, Hyun's hand danced continuously over the staff.

"Would you like to see it, Maestro?"

Yuri carefully took the sheet music Hyun handed him. His sharp eyes widened gradually.

"What kind of inspiration leads to composing such a piece...?"

Muttering to himself, Yuri's eyes were wide open.

Hyun kept the inspiration he got from the conflict between Spencer and Yuri to himself and spoke.

"This is a gift for you, Maestro."

"Sorry, but I can't easily accept such an outstanding piece."

The sheet music was intricately composed, reminiscent of Bazzini's Dance of the Goblins.

It featured double stops, pizzicato, and harmonics, with a fast tempo from the beginning to the fermata at the final bar line.

It was impressive for a piece created in just thirty minutes.

"Then, may I ask a favor in return, Maestro?"

"I'll do anything."

"It might be an unreasonable request. Even if you refuse, I'd like you to keep the sheet music."

Yuri nodded readily. Receiving such a high-quality sheet music piece, how could he refuse? He was prepared to accept any request. Moreover, he had plenty of free time on his sabbatical.

Hyun bowed respectfully to Maestro Yuri.

"Maestro, please teach me conducting."
