Sizzle, sizzleâ€•!

The richly marbled meat is cooking nicely on the grill, making my mouth water. A shot of soju would make this moment perfect.

However, the atmosphere at the table was reminiscent of a tense first meeting between in-laws. Two people with fierce expressions were staring each other down intensely.

"This is traditional Korean beef. I hope it suits your taste, but the texture and flavor are excellent. I hope the maestros enjoy it."

Only then did the two stop their staring contest and focus on the meat. Interestingly, despite being Westerners, both were proficient with chopsticks.

Well, they must have toured the world with their orchestras from a young age, experiencing all sorts of delicacies.

"Is it really okay for me to be treated like this by Hyun?"

"No, it's my pleasure to treat you maestros who have come all the way to Korea to see me."

"Thank you for saying that."

Just in case, I brought the corporate card. We were at a high-end barbecue restaurant known for entertaining high-profile guests like members of the National Assembly. I had been here a few times in my past life.

I wonder if Im Hyera will be surprised when she sees the bill. It was when we were choosing after-meal tea that it happened.

"Hyun, I'll have Ssanghwa tea, please."

"What?"

"Remember the tea you served me and the maestro before? Dmitri loved it, saying it was similar to Vin Chaud."

I never expected to be cleansing my palate with Ssanghwa tea with foreigners. As the tea cups were emptied, Yuri broke the silence.

"I'll get straight to the point. Hyun, are you still considering the offer I made two years ago?"

"Maestro Yuri, I'm sorry, but I believe I made the same offer. And I met Hyun first, didn't I?"

"Maestro Spencer, I'm sorry, but musicians need to join the orchestra that suits them best. The decision to join isn't based on who asked first, but Hyun's choice."

Spencer furrowed his brows, and Yuri raised his eyebrows, looking like they were about to clash like titans.

Their charisma and intimidating looks were so intense that the restaurant's waitress was trembling as she served us.

Anyone who saw this would mistake it for a mafia boss meeting rather than a conversation between maestros.

"Ahem, Maestro Spencer, how long will you be staying in Korea?"

"Why do you ask?"

"As far as I know, there's a royal celebration symphony in London soon. I didn't realize you had so much free time. I assume you'll be returning to London shortly? I have plenty of time since I'm on sabbatical."

Spencer's face contorted in frustration. It seemed Yuri's words were true. The tension between them was palpable, and I felt the need to mediate before it got out of hand.

Just as I was about to step in, Spencer turned to me and said, "Then Hyun, promise me one thing."

What?

"If you're not coming to London, don't go to Berlin either."

** *

'London and Berlin.'

Any other musician would be envious to hear those names. The overwhelming love calls were enough to make my head spin.

Maestro Spencer had repeatedly emphasized until his departure that if I went to Berlin without informing him, he would personally come and kick my butt.

Knowing his temperament, it wouldn't end with just a kick.

"We've arrived, Kang Hyun."

The voice of Mr. Kim, the chauffeur, snapped me out of my thoughts. I had grown to enjoy coming to school in my uniform. The reason was simple. In exchange for helping the music students, I was excused from regular classes.

"Hyunseon, your left fingers are overall too stiff compared to your right when you press the keys. And if you look at the second movement's sheet music, it says 'Adagio Cantabile.' Play it slowly, as if singing. The structure of the movement should start lyrically, build up passionately, and end lyrically again. But your performance feels like it jumps out of nowhere."

It's like changing lanes slowly with your blinkers on, but suddenly changing from the third lane to the first without any signal.

"Thank you, Hyun."

The students took my feedback very well. It was natural since I pinpointed the issues quickly.

However, there were more students involved in classical music than I thought. There were dozens of them. If it weren't for Jael Middle School's excellent facilities, which rival those of a music college, they wouldn't all fit.

"Hyun, can you take a look at my posture for a moment?"

It was a boy specializing in the violin. Although we were in the same grade, we hadn't met often since I didn't attend school regularly.

"Jinho, you need to loosen up when you draw the bow. Right now, the melody feels too stiff, as if you're trying not to miss a single note. It's devoid of emotion. You can work on your posture afterward."

This issue arises when one focuses solely on completing the performance. Singing a melody without emotion isn't music. Despite this, Jinho was receptive to my advice. If he didn't have the potential and skills to grow, I wouldn't have been so blunt.

"Jinho, can I ask why you're working so hard on the violin?"

He stayed after school every day to practice diligently. I heard he was also good at studying.

But when he played the violin, it felt like he was putting his life on the line. His determination was comparable to that of seasoned violinists.

"I want to be recognized by my parents. My father hates that I play the violin."

Well, it's understandable. Some adults dislike music, even classical.

Especially in these uncertain times. Parents can't wholeheartedly support their children focusing on an instrument when the economy is in turmoil and it's unclear when the financial crisis will end.

'Hmm.'

Today marked the first week of helping the music students with their posture.

Most of them said they were participating in various competitions in December. They were all from well-known families.

Some were defying their families' opposition to pursue music, which was impressive. Each one had a spark in their eyes.

"Would any of you be interested in performing at the graduation ceremony? You'll have plenty of time after the competitions in December."

There was no response. It seemed like a waste to let such talented performers go unrecognized. It was also a golden opportunity to showcase their skills in front of their parents.

"Hyun, we haven't ruled out the idea, but there are too many of us. How could so many people perform together?"

That was when Kim Jinho spoke up.

As he said, the students played a variety of instruments, from violins and cellos to clarinets, flutes, and double basses.

The string section was already nearly complete.

"Why do you think that?"

The students looked at me in bewilderment. It was simple: rearrange some of the instrument sections.

"We can all perform together."

"Hyun is really talented."

Chairman Wang's voice echoed in the reception room, full of excitement.

"But I'm worried I'll lose my grandson-in-law to an orchestra."

"Son, since when did Hyun become your grandson-in-law?"

"Ha ha, my friend, wasn't that agreed upon when we first met? We decided to marry off our grandchildren."

Was that promise made or not? Regardless, Chairman Wang smiled slyly and took a sip of tea.

"It's been days since we arrived in Korea, but my grandson hasn't come to see me yet."

"My friend, you know how busy Hyun is lately."

Indeed, renowned maestros had come all the way from abroad to see Hyun. Despite this, Chairman Wang's expression remained stern.

Suddenly, Chairman Wang smirked. Chairman Yoo knew exactly what that expression meant.

"Are you planning to tease Hyun?"

"Of course, I need to remind him of the importance of his grandfather."

"Our Hyun isn't someone who can be easily swayed. You know that. He can foresee several moves ahead."

Chairman Yoo had been amazed countless times by his grandson.

Especially his insight into South Korea's market economy was enough to send chills down his spine. Hadn't he correctly predicted the government's bailout plans?

But Chairman Wang was no ordinary person either. He wasn't called a giant in the business world for nothing.

"My friend, relay this message to Hyun."

"What message?"

At that moment, Chairman Wang's face lit up with mischief. "The most underhanded thing in the world is to give and then take away."

"Are all these scores composed by Violinist Hyun?"

Yuri, the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic, couldn't hide his pure admiration.

He was usually expressionless, but the sheer number of scores left him in awe.

Yuri had to dispel the thoughts he had harbored. It was a clear misjudgment.

Violinist Hyun hadn't been idle for the past two years.

"It's truly unbelievable."

Names of legendary composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Vivaldi flashed through Yuri's mind.

The number of scores was staggering, considering they were composed over the past two years.

And their quality? Each note on the staff was so meticulously crafted that it left Yuri speechless.

"May I observe your composition process?"

"Of course, Maestro."

Hyun nodded without hesitation. He was not a sensitive artist. Hadn't Baek Junghoon been coming to the studio regularly?

Moreover, thanks to the upgraded software compared to his past life, Hyun's concentration was unparalleled.

How much time had passed?

Like Mozart, who supposedly wrote masterpieces while having a cup of tea, Hyun's hands danced over the staff continuously.

"Would you like to take a look, Maestro?"

Yuri carefully accepted the score Hyun handed him. His sharp eyes gradually widened.

"What kind of inspiration must one have to compose such a piece......."

Yuri's eyes were wide open as he muttered to himself.

Hyun silently swallowed the words that he had been inspired by the clash between Spencer and Yuri.

"Maestro, this is a gift for you."

"I'm sorry, but I can't easily accept such an exceptional piece."

The score was intricately composed, reminiscent of Bazzini's "La Ronde des Lutins."

It featured double stops, pizzicato techniques, harmonics, and a fast tempo from the beginning to the fermata on the double bar line.

It was hard to believe it was composed in just thirty minutes.

"Then, Maestro, may I make a request?"

"I will grant you anything."

"It might be an impertinent request. Even if you refuse, I hope you'll accept the score."

Yuri readily nodded. How could he refuse such a high-level score? He was willing to accept any request. Moreover, he had ample time on his sabbatical.

At that moment, Hyun bowed politely to Maestro Yuri. "Maestro, please teach me conducting."
