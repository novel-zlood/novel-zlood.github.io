Producer Paul had a grand dream: to create a great band like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, or Queen with his own hands.

“Michelle, did you complete all these songs in such a short time?”

Paul looked at the numerous music sheets, shaking his head in disbelief. The staff lines were filled with densely drawn notes. He hadn't heard the results yet, but he wondered if this was even possible. He thought maybe Michelle helped, but that couldn’t be. Knowing her usual demeanor, it was out of the question.

“Are you saying Mozart has come back to life?”

Michelle nodded briefly in response to his humorous question. Paul barely suppressed a sigh of frustration.

The classical music he heard in the old town was truly a masterpiece. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the joys and sorrows of life were encapsulated in its melody. That’s why he had asked a young genius to compose music. However, classical and band music were distinctly different. He had heard that the composer was still learning the basics, and as his mind wandered...

“I’ll play the first track.”

Michelle skillfully handled the synthesizer.

At that moment.

Bang―!

Paul felt as if his mind had been pierced. Just hearing the first syllable made his head buzz. Even though composing devices had advanced, it was commonly believed in the producing world that they still couldn’t match the real sounds. But what was this resonance? Moreover...

‘What on earth is this.’

It was definitely not the rock music he’d heard before. It was an entirely new kind of music unfolding. The artificial sound was seamlessly beautiful, offering an emotional impact. The rookie band that had come along was already lost in the melody. They couldn’t stand up from their seats. The sounds were so diverse that it was hard for their ears to keep up, making them wish for more ears.

Composers often make the framework, and lyricists fill it. Finally, it’s the role of producers like himself to breathe life into the song. However, the current piece seemed vividly alive just with its notes.

Only after playing through the seventh song did Paul finally exhale the breath he’d been holding. The rookie band, Iris, felt the same way. Even a band with a strong musical worldview of their own was so entranced, it was no wonder.

“Michelle, where is this person now?”

Paul urgently looked at Michelle. At that moment, he instinctively knew that the lineage of bands would be written again in this era dominated by American pop music.

“Oppaaa―!”

As soon as he arrived at Gimpo Airport, Son Yooha ran towards him like a gust of wind. Anyone would think she was waiting for a soldier returning from the military.

Son Yooha, who had come close in no time, greeted with ladylike manners, and his mother looked at her affectionately. His mother especially adored Yooha.

“Did Yooha miss Hyun a lot?”

Son Yooha smiled faintly, perhaps feeling shy.

“Oh, Yooha. Here, take this.”

Just in time, he took out the present he had bought in the old town of Chartres. He had prepared it out of gratitude for her unnoticed kindness. It was his first time buying a gift for a girl, so he struggled quite a bit. Eventually, he chose a hairpin with a blue cubic. He hoped she would like it since he had carefully selected it.

“Thank you so much, Oppa.”

Luckily, Yooha immediately put on the hairpin. In the past, Yooha would have immediately hugged him. But now, she was holding back, biting her lip and welling up with tears. She seemed a bit different than before.

“You guys are acting as if you’re filming a movie again.”

At that moment, Grandfather and President Wang appeared with satisfied smiles.

Sizzle―!

The feast was like no other. From a shinsunro to meat pancakes usually seen during holidays. The housekeeper had obviously put in a lot of effort. Although they were treated like returning heroes whenever they came back from abroad, they felt both grateful and a bit guilty. They were glad they had prepared a gift for the housekeeper this time; otherwise, they wouldn’t have dared to lift a spoon.

The bustling Ichon-dong mansion was filled with uncles and aunts, unlike usual. Normally, the aunt would boast about her children without any sense, but now she was hiccupping, and the eldest uncle looked pale as if he might collapse any moment.

The reason was simple. President Wang was also present. No matter how close the adults were, President Wang was still intimidating.

“Hyun, you haven’t forgotten our promise, have you?”

When President Wang looked at him and spoke familiarly, he felt the eyes of his aunt and eldest uncle widen. Grandfather looked at him and President Wang alternately with a curious gaze, as if dying to know what was going on.

“How long do you think it will take, Hyun?”

The promise to bring Dongju Chemical into the top 7 in the chemical industry.

As the enigmatic question continued, an unknown tension filled the dining table. Grandfather quietly observed the situation as if enjoying it.

After pondering for a moment, Hyun held up five fingers. It might have looked like a child’s joke.

“Five years? That’s shorter than I expected.”

No, Grandfather.

He subtly glanced at his father across the table. His father looked visibly tense. No matter how often he met President Wang, he couldn’t get used to it. He wanted to tell his father right then and there.

That in five months, the Gryphon development test would be a success.

It had only been about a month since he last wore his school uniform, but it felt awkward and uncomfortable. He considered skipping a grade, but there was no such system in middle school, which was compulsory education.

Still, his hands itched to compose more music.

Composing for Iris had made him realize something. He loved music itself beyond the violin. Come to think of it...

‘I never properly treated Michelle.’

He wanted to treat Michelle to a meal at a nice restaurant, but he couldn’t because of his flight schedule. She not only taught him to compose but also helped him with the copyright registration process in detail.

He had no choice but to look forward to the next opportunity. If the producer liked his compositions, he would have to visit France again anyway.

But why was it so busy?

The view of Jeil Middle School outside the car window was different from usual. The students were all moving busily.

“Hyun, today is the festival day!”

The class president with short bobbed hair was jumping with joy knowing that he had returned today. If it weren’t for him, the class president would have had to perform on the festival stage, so she felt like she had narrowly escaped a disaster.

Looking at the stage setup, it was indeed fitting for a middle school under the Jeil Foundation. Although it was the 90s, the auditorium’s facilities surpassed those of most universities. Anyone would think a party was being held here.

“Hyun, have you decided what to perform?”

“What?”

He hadn’t even thought about what to perform at the festival, being too engrossed in composing. So many things had happened in the past month.

But looking at the class president’s expectant face, he couldn’t bring himself to say he hadn’t prepared.

As he stepped onto the stage, all eyes turned to him. Even the principal had taken a good seat to watch him.

What should he play?

Would the kids like classical music? Although they were children of well-known companies and probably learned classical music socially, it didn’t quite fit the festive mood. Moreover, the music he had been playing lately had a lyrical tone.

Meanwhile, the practice violin he held seemed to cry out to be played.

Alright,

“I will perform Iris.”

It was the first track from the sheet music he gave to the band Iris. Although it was a rearrangement for the violin, it wasn’t difficult. The inspiration had already echoed in his mind countless times.

Not only the students but also the music teacher looked puzzled. They had never heard of a classical piece called Iris.

Would it start with a lively melody or a lyrical tune?

With everyone’s attention focused, he set down the bow and started plucking the strings with his fingers.

Was it a snare drum or a marimba? The pulsating sound echoed through the ceiling, unbelievable for a violin.

However, his hands moved so quickly that the rhythm became more intense. Thump thump thump.

As everyone’s heart danced to the beat,

Zing―!

The bow vigorously crossed the strings.

The first syllable of Iris resonated from the violin, leaving a strong impression like the daechwita in traditional Korean music captivating the audience. Originally, it was a piece meant to include guitar, bass, and drums, but he expressed all that with a single string instrument.

As the vigorous bowing came to an end and he smiled, cheers erupted from all around. The audience couldn’t take their eyes off the new music they were hearing for the first time, as if witnessing a new era.

His father had dark circles under his eyes. It was only natural, given the grueling schedule of the past few days.

He wanted to tell his father that the end was near, but what could he do? He covered his father with a blanket as he lay asleep on the desk, feeling sorry.

Early in the morning, he headed to Gimpo Airport with his grandfather and mother. He wasn’t the one going abroad. He didn’t realize the recent change in the crybaby was because of this.

“It’s not easy to see such a young child going abroad,” his mother said.

He didn’t feel at ease either.

But it was almost a given for the children of chaebol families, especially heirs, to study abroad. They learned leadership from a young age, completed their MBA courses, and then entered the workforce.

Moreover, it was easier to study abroad, away from the media attention in Korea.

In his previous life, Son Yooha had also studied abroad from a young age, so he knew she would go someday. But he didn’t expect it to come so soon.

“Hello, Grandfather.”

“Yes, Hyun is here. Yooha went to the restroom. She said she wanted to wash her face when she heard you were coming.”

He politely greeted Chairman Wang, who was already at Gimpo Airport.

Next to him were Son Ilsung and Im Hyera, making it look like the entire Jeil Group’s executives were gathered.

Seeing many police officers at Gimpo Airport early in the morning, one could feel the tension.

“Oppa.......”

Someone tugged at his sleeve. It was Son Yooha, who had appeared unnoticed. The hairpin he had given her was shining brightly on her head.

She must have cried a lot last night. Her swollen eyes made him feel sad.

“I’m fine!”

Son Yooha smiled cheerfully, trying to look brave. Normally, she would have cried and said she didn’t want to go, but something seemed different now. Something might have touched Yooha’s heart.

It was a study abroad trip with bodyguards and even a secretary. As Yooha, who had been holding his hand for a long time, walked towards the ticketing counter when it was time to board, he felt sorry to see her back. It looked like she was trying to distance herself from him. Perhaps this was the real Son Yooha he remembered from his past life.

At that moment.

“Oppaaa―!”

Son Yooha suddenly turned around and ran towards him, hugging him tightly with a tear-streaked face.

He gently patted her back. He knew how lonely it was to study abroad at a young age.

At that moment, Yooha looked up, meeting his eyes. Her swollen eyes shed tears like chicken droppings.

“Hicc, I’ll come back every vacation―!”

“Yes, Yooha.”

“I’ll definitely come to see you, heong.”

She spoke each word with effort, tears mixing into her voice. He lovingly patted Yooha’s head.

Chairman Wang and Grandfather watched the scene with sad smiles. Looking at the receding figure of Yooha, he thought of the future.

Surely that small back would one day rise to the top of Jeil Group. He looked forward to the imminent return of the Ice Queen.
