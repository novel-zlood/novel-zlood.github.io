“Maestro?”

Spencer approached Karas, who was sitting alone in the concert hall. Wasn't today a day without a performance or rehearsal?

“Did you come to the concert hall again today?”

In fact, it wasn't the first time. Even when there was no performance or rehearsal, Maestro Karas would sometimes sit alone in the empty seats of the concert hall. Her eyes were as vivid as if she was reminiscing about the past.

“There is nothing as peaceful as sitting in the seats of the concert hall without doing anything.”

“I feel the same way. There is nothing better than sitting in the audience seats and looking at the stage.”

The two maestros silently looked at the empty stage. However, the stage they were looking at was surely different for each of them.

How much time had passed? It was Maestro Karas who spoke first.

“Maestro, do you know what Hyun is doing now? I heard that he entered the Royal Academy of Music, but he hasn’t visited the London Symphony, so honestly, it makes me anxious. I want to hear his performance.”

“He might be experiencing time he never had before.”

“Time he never had before?”

Spencer nodded briefly.

Kang Hyun was a boy with extraordinary talent, even in the eyes of maestros.

But maybe because of that, he moved forward without hesitation, like a car speeding down a straight highway.

“He must have met a younger genius for the first time.”

“Are you saying such a person is at the Royal Academy of Music?”

“I haven’t seen him myself. I've heard that the Queen, who was the previous president of the Royal Academy of Music, personally approved his admission. Prince Samuel, the current president of the Royal Academy of Music, who is my childhood friend, told me he is an amazing kid. But in my view, he is walking a different path from Hyun.”

“A different path?”

“It’s hard to express in words, but that’s the feeling I got from Prince Samuel.”

Karas looked intrigued. A genius recognized by the royal family was rare.

“Moreover, I hear he is extremely reluctant to perform in front of others. So, not many people in the classical music world know him yet. Honestly, I'm curious too.”

Spencer still gazed at the stage.

“I wonder what kind of stimulation will occur when Hyun meets that kid.”

* * *

Do geniuses have something in common?

‘Ten hours already.’

Hadn't they been in the practice room for almost half a day?

Morning had passed, and dusk had fallen again, but Kang Hyun and Sabrina's conversation showed no sign of ending.

Tommy felt his mouth getting dry, but he thought he could die happily if he could keep listening to their performance.

Especially their musical talent that immediately filled in each other's lacking parts was indescribable.

Were the unparalleled geniuses who led the golden age of classical music like this?

“We need to revise the 3rd movement.”

“Sabrina, it's already quite late.”

“Huh?”

Only then did Sabrina look out the window. The dusk was thick.

It seemed she hadn't realized how absorbed she was.

“Sabrina, if you’re okay with it, I don’t mind staying in the practice room longer.”

“Really?”

“Yes, because I enjoy talking with you.”

“That goes for me too!”

Sabrina gave a pure white smile. For Tommy, who had often seen Sabrina, it was absurd.

He had never seen Sabrina smile before. At that moment, a series of assumptions crossed Tommy’s mind.

‘Could it be because she had no one to talk to?’

Was the reason Sabrina didn’t come forward in front of people simply because she had no one to talk to?

Though it seemed like a grand assumption, considering Sabrina’s musical talent, it wasn’t impossible.

Then Hyun looked at Tommy and spoke.

“Tommy, if you’re okay, you can go now.”

“Oh, no...! Can I stay and watch you guys practice? No, I really want to watch. I’ll be quiet, so please don’t kick me out. Please, Hyun, Sabrina!”

“I’m fine with it, how about you, Sabrina?”

“I’m okay too. Tommy is our only audience right now.”

Tommy felt excited as though his body was heating up.

Partly because Sabrina remembered his name, and partly because he was recognized as an audience.

Moreover, his heart was already pounding wildly at the thought of listening to these two play all night!

How much time had passed?

Though he hadn’t slept a wink, he wasn’t tired; the lingering resonance of the melodies continued. It felt like he had dreamed even without sleeping.

Tommy was grateful and thankful to be in such a place.

As Sabrina finished the last performance, she stretched as if feeling refreshed and said,

“Shall we all go have breakfast now?”

“Sounds good, Sabrina.”

“Me, me too!”

Sabrina led the way, followed by Hyun and Tommy. When her silver hair swayed and she opened the practice room door,

Crash!

Many people who had been sitting beyond the practice room fell back startled.

They hadn’t expected Sabrina to come out like this. Among them were Professor Bianca of Violin and Professor Albert of Cello.

There were even other professors from different majors. Watching this, Hyun gave a faint smile.

“They’re the audience who waited for us.”

* * *

“Sabrina?”

President Samuel asked back in disbelief.

“Professor Bianca, are you saying that Sabrina played in front of others?”

“Yes, President. Sabrina played with Hyun in the practice room for a long time. Professor Albert and I even listened to the melodies in front of the practice room. Many students also stayed up all night listening to the melodies.”

“Wow—!”

It was an exclamation of surprise. Who was Sabrina?

She was a prodigy discovered personally by the Queen, who was the mother of President Samuel and could be called the godmother of England.

The Queen once said that when she first saw Sabrina in a rural village of England, she was instantly captivated by her violin performance.

A seven-year-old girl who had never learned music from anyone had bewitched the Queen.

However, the girl’s heart was like a locked door. At some point, she refused to perform in front of anyone.

Who would have thought Hyun would open her heart’s door? And so quickly!

“How was the performance?”

“It was a piece I had never heard before.”

“A piece you had never heard before?”

“Because of the soundproof walls of the practice room, I couldn’t hear it clearly, but the flowing melody was definitely a violin piece I had never heard before. From the way the movements changed, Professor Albert and I judged it to be an original composition. It seemed Hyun and Sabrina composed a violin piece together in the practice room.”

President Samuel was filled with the desire to listen to their performance right away.

But he knew that if he acted hastily, Sabrina might shut her heart’s door again.

In the end, he decided he should at least hear a detailed impression of the original composition.

“Then, is there no one who heard the performance precisely?”

“No, there was one audience.”

“There was an audience?”

Professor Bianca nodded. For some reason, Sabrina hadn’t kicked out one audience.

He was a freckled boy majoring in the cello.

When asked by Professor Albert, he said the boy had talent but was blocked by the limits he set for himself.

Professor Bianca couldn’t shake off the strange feeling. The audience Sabrina recognized wasn’t a genius like Hyun but a boy with ordinary talent at the Royal Academy of Music.

“It was a student named Tommy.”

* * *

“Sabrina and Hyun...?”

It felt like being the manager of top stars.

Tommy had been at the Royal Academy of Music for a long time, but this feeling was new.

When Hyun and Sabrina walked together, it was like the Red Sea parting, with students making way for them.

Moreover, the looks of disbelief followed.

“Tommy, how was today’s performance?”

“It was truly amazing.”

Tommy couldn’t attach many adjectives to Hyun’s question. Excessive embellishments and praises seemed to belittle their performance.

He was also recognized for his musical talent and was called a prodigy in Cambridge.

But compared to Hyun and Sabrina, the music he had done so far seemed like child’s play.

A common person would feel frustration and despair at their performance and talent.

But not Tommy. He was filled with a musical desire to somehow delve into Hyun and Sabrina’s musical talent from the side.

It was pure musical yearning, excluding foolish feelings of jealousy and envy.

“Hyun, Tommy. Can you look at this score?”

Sabrina handed over the score she had created to Hyun and Tommy.

Tommy’s eyes widened as he looked at the score Sabrina composed. Hyun had enormous talent in composing, but Sabrina was no less.

Surely the professors in composition would be astounded if they saw the scores of these two.

However, Hyun scrutinized Sabrina’s score intensely and soon picked up a red pen to mark the parts he wanted to revise.

“I’d like to change this part like this. If it's too strong, it will eventually break. I want to add some wavering to the melody. Gracefully. What do you think, Sabrina?”

“It’s really good. But how about changing this part like this?”

“It’s an ingenious idea. I like it.”

Only then did Sabrina show a satisfied smile.

Tommy still didn’t understand. To him, it seemed like a perfect score.

But it seemed different in the eyes of the two geniuses. On one hand, he wondered why the two geniuses hung out with him.

When Hyun and Sabrina appeared even in the cafeteria, the students’ stares and whispers increased.

Sabrina’s musical talent, known as the “White Witch,” was already famous at the Royal Academy of Music. Her talent was undeniable.

Moreover, due to their performance in the practice room, not only students but even professors were lingering in front of the practice room.

But because of that, some students looked at Tommy with envious and jealous eyes.

As if saying that his place as an audience should have been theirs.

Though it had been a week since he became close friends with Hyun and Sabrina, Tommy still couldn’t understand.

Why did Hyun and Sabrina choose him as their audience among so many people? At that moment,

“The Royal Academy of Music concert?”

Hyun asked as he saw the poster on the hallway. Tommy, already familiar with the event, answered immediately.

“It’s an annual concert for students and professors. Students participate, but the real highlight is the performances by alumni.”

“Can anyone participate?”

“Um, you can participate if you sign up…”

Tommy trailed off. It was because not many students had the confidence to sign up for the Royal Academy of Music concert.

This place was already filled with recognized musically talented individuals. Moreover, the professors and senior students were prestigious.

Participating in the school concert with mediocre skills was an easy way to embarrass oneself.

At that moment,

“Then let’s join.”

Hyun said as he looked at Sabrina and Tommy alternately.
