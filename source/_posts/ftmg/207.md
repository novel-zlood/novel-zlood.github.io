Thud!

Kim Namcheon was playing Go alone. Solving life-and-death situations was an excellent way to shake off thoughts.

As the white and black stones piled up on the Go board, it felt like peace was returning to his mind.

It was when Kim Namcheon's wrinkled fingers picked up another black stone.

"Sir, someone from Son Kangwook's side has come again. What should we do?"

At the secretary's question, Kim Namcheon lifted his head. Hadn't people been coming down from Seoul for the past week?

One day, someone had even spent the night in front of his gate, saying they wanted to meet him. However, Kim Namcheon shook his head.

It was just like a messenger who never returns.

Tsk.

Kim Namcheon clicked his tongue inwardly. Wasn't it obvious that he had failed to read the situation? Who would have thought that 'Teacher Deoksoo' would reveal himself?

"We will no longer ally with Son Kangwook."

The secretary nodded without a word and backed away cautiously.

Kim Namcheon was more aware of the current situation than anyone else. During the Japanese occupation, he was called a traitor, and during the military regime, he was labeled a typical opportunist.

There were few who understood the state of affairs in South Korea better than Kim Namcheon.

'Teacher Deoksoo.'

Just like a divine move capturing a large group of stones, the person Chairman Wang had prepared was a significant move that could shake the entire board.

At one time, Kim Namcheon had also put in a great deal of effort to find 'Teacher Deoksoo.'

It was a secret known to only a very select few in the business world that Chairman Wang of the Jeil Group had a mentor.

But no matter how hard he tried, the man was like a mirage—impossible to find.

For twenty years, Kim Namcheon had searched for Teacher Deoksoo, but all he met were impostors using his name. He never saw a glimpse of the real one.

He had disappeared so thoroughly that even the power of the military regime couldn't find him.

"Hyera has returned to Korea, right?"

"Yes, sir."

"Prepare to make an opportunity to meet that child."

The person who found Teacher Deoksoo must be that child.

Hadn't he sensed it when she suddenly came to him, asking to meet Gwangyang Baekgorae?

To think that she found Teacher Deoksoo, whom he couldn't find in twenty years, in an instant. She was definitely no ordinary child.

"By now, there must be a storm brewing in Seoul."

Indeed, with Teacher Deoksoo revealing himself, a thick scent of blood would fill the air. Could Son Kangwook, who had been so arrogant, overcome this crisis?

Kim Namcheon picked up a white stone with a sly smile. If that child asked him the same question now, he would answer like this:

Ten percent.

Waves of emotions surged like the tide. Everyone's faces were filled with shock.

Among them, the most notable was Son Kangwook. His eyes were wide open as if they would tear apart, and his trembling lips were in stark contrast.

"F-Father―!"

He had never imagined that Chairman Wang would appear.

The other executives were the same. Those who had sided with Son Kangwook were drenched in cold sweat.

Just as Son Kangwook didn't know what to do, standing there,

"Someone who knows the Jeil Group better than anyone and is second to none in management and business in South Korea, this man is the right person I mentioned. What do you think, President Son Kangwook? Isn't he a talent worthy of your approval?"

Son Kangwook's pupils shook as if an earthquake had hit them.

Chairman Wang, in his wheelchair, radiated an immense aura. He not only overwhelmed the general meeting but also plunged everyone into tension and silence.

"Even if you don't like it, what can you do? After all, I'm the current chairman of Jeil Group, and this is my decision. If you can't even make a statement when I'm stepping down, I'll cause a scene. And public and private matters should be handled properly, President Son Kangwook."

"Public and private matters?"

"You ousted President Son Ilseon of Jeil Electronics under the guise of doing it for Jeil Group, but it turns out you are not so clean yourself. Weren't you planning to sell Jeil Electronics to foreign capital? Ignoring the executives who followed you. I never imagined you would rush to complete the sale so quickly, as if you anticipated Chairman Son Jangwon's collapse."

Son Kangwook's expression twisted. The executives looked at him with disbelief. At that moment, a wheelchair rolled onto the platform.

"Have you all been well?"

It was a simple sentence, but it carried immense power. Chairman Wang's gaze swept across the room. The executives who met his eyes all showed scared expressions.

Among them were those who had switched sides from Son Ilseon to Son Kangwook.

But he had no intention of blaming them here.

"While I was gone, Jeil Group got caught up in many incidents. The group's management system was paralyzed due to the absence of President Son Ilseon of Jeil Electronics, which I hadn't foreseen. And for the vacancy to be filled by Executive Director Son Kangwook of Jeil Trading, who is not even a professional manager. It's like leaving fish with a cat. Do you all have such a poor eye for people?"

Chairman Wang's words seemed to reprimand him, and Son Kangwook swallowed hard.

"The specifics of Jeil Electronics' accounting fraud are still under investigation by the prosecution, but no conclusion has been reached. I believe President Son Ilseon is innocent. I think there are others in the prosecution who share my belief. And I plan to use this opportunity to clean up those unnecessary in the group. Of course, I'm not talking about evaluating their professional abilities but those who have harmed the group. I believe you all understand."

The executives' eyes were filled with tension. Who among them wouldn't have any dirt? They were like bats that had betrayed Chairman Wang and clung to Son Kangwook.

A long silence followed. Even Son Kangwook, who had been sitting in a position of power, couldn't utter a word.

"First."

Chairman Wang's eyes gleamed.

"President Son Kangwook, let's start with sorting out your rights and wrongs."

It was the moment Son Kangwook's short reign of one week ended.

[Breaking news: Jeil Group Chairman Son Jangwon has recovered and reappeared. It is reported that many shareholders were surprised by Chairman Son Jangwon's appearance at the Jeil Group headquarters, where the interim general meeting of shareholders was held. Chairman Son Jangwon, nicknamed 'the King,' immediately dominated the chaotic atmosphere of the general meeting. According to market opinions, Chairman Son Jangwon's recovery is expected to stabilize the volatile stock market. For more precise opinions, we will invite an expert.]

The media must have been delighted. Indeed, wasn't it a scoop every day?

The news covered Chairman Wang's story day after day. Moreover, it was said that Chairman Wang, to show his health, went to work at Jeil Group without a wheelchair from the next day. But,

"Sir, why are you here?"

"You rascal, are you mocking me from the morning?"

Teacher Deoksoo had been staying at the mansion in Ichon-dong.

Wasn't he already enjoying ribs from the morning? It was hard to tell how many bowls of rice he had already emptied.

Teacher Deoksoo, who was savoring a rib, added,

"It will take quite some time to completely catch Son Kangwook, even if he is my disciple. I'm staying here instead of going to Jirisan to help. It's the season to harvest autumn vegetables. What a pity."

"It's not that, but I think you should be in Pyeongchang-dong, not Ichon-dong."

"You rascal, my taste suits Ichon-dong, not Pyeongchang-dong. And your grandfather seems happy to have a companion after a long time. Now, a young rascal like you is trying to kick this old man out. Can I live with such sorrow?"

Despite his words, his face remained as relaxed as ever.

"What do you plan to do in the future?"

"Excuse me?"

"Are you asking like a parrot again? Didn't I say I studied destiny and fortune-telling? Hyun, you have a great fortune in business, so whatever you do will be a great success. But you also have talent and heavenly luck in music. I'd like to teach you myself, but the most important thing is your will."

I hesitated at Teacher Deoksoo's question. It was because I still hadn't figured out exactly what I wanted to do.

I didn't want to chase after material desires and power like in my past life.

But after experiencing various business matters with Teacher Deoksoo for a few days, didn't I feel adrenaline surging through my body?

Teacher Deoksoo seemed to understand my feelings.

"Hyun, you are a typical gambler. Do you think I wouldn't know that you collected the Jeil Group's stocks shaken by Son Kangwook? My disciple probably likes you so much because he sees your inner self. If I were him, I would have chosen you as the heir after Son Ilseon. Weren't you planning to marry my disciple's granddaughter anyway?"

"Sir, Yooha is still in high school!"

"You rascal, in the old days, she would have already gotten married and had a son. You look like a scholar, but I know there's an old man as old as me inside you. Sometimes, talking to you feels like talking to an old man."

Talking to Teacher Deoksoo made me feel like my mind was being read.

Moreover, unlike other elders, Teacher Deoksoo didn't hide his feelings, so his straightforward way of speaking shook my heart.

"I want to find happiness."

"Happiness?"

"They say money can buy happiness, but that's not all. Having money and power doesn't necessarily make you happy."

"You talk like someone who has already lived such a life. Then the best way is right in front of you. Don't cling to various things anymore and do what you want."

"What I want?"

"Yes, you have a broad-mindedness. Even in this matter, wasn't it because of your broad-mindedness that you sought me out? It was only because of your connection with my disciple. No ordinary person could have done that. Now, stop being so broad-minded and do what you want. If you want to learn management, come to me."

The distortion of history caused by me was being corrected.

Teacher Deoksoo's advice was enough to ring a bell in my mind.

What I want to do the most!

Bzzz.

At that moment, violin melodies unconsciously resounded in my mind.
