“How do you evaluate a conductor?”

It was a difficult and subtle question.

“To the general public, conducting may seem hard to approach and requires enough charisma to control an orchestra with just a flick of the wrist. However, since conductors don’t actually play an instrument, it’s hard to judge what makes a good conductor or a bad one. Moreover, the audience always only sees the conductor’s back.”

That such a fundamental question would arise at a press conference for a royal performance was unexpected, even though they were prepared for sudden questions.

Spencer leaned forward towards the reporter looking at him. Most of the general public watching the broadcast probably had similar thoughts.

“Conducting is essentially a profession that interprets and expresses pre-existing music. It’s often said that the notes of the dead are revived at the conductor's fingertips. The criteria for evaluating conducting are similar yet different.”

“Different, you say?”

“Yes. The textbook says the tip of the baton should move between the chest and the belly button, but if you visit world-renowned orchestras, you’ll see that conductors’ hand movements vary. Some use their entire upper body as if thunder is striking, while others move delicately like a child’s steps.”

Other reporters now started paying attention and picked up their notebooks.

“The elements of evaluating conducting are simple: interpretation of the piece, technical ability, and communication with the members. However, these are all impossible without experience and maturity. Furthermore, evaluating the conducting of maestros is very difficult.”

“Maestro, what do you mean by difficult?”

“For example, think of Empress Karis of Austria and Billstein of America. If Karis captivates the audience with bold movements, Billstein pursues a soft and refined melody. Both are world-renowned maestros, but their styles are so different that no one can say who is better. It's a perfect difference in style.”

Everyone agreed with the notion of a difference in style. Both Karis and Billstein were figures who always appeared when choosing world-class maestros.

“I don’t like ranking music. But,”

While the reporter nodded, Spencer added a word.

“The reason the general audience is so confused is because there is no absolute standard for evaluating conductors. Today’s orchestras are so competitive that no one can easily say who is the best.”

“By absolute standard, do you mean the best in the world?”

“Yes. If a conductor emerges who is recognized as the best among the world-renowned maestros, that would create an absolute standard for conducting. Of course, I’m not referring to myself.”

At that moment, the reporter asked Spencer again, “Is there someone you have in mind?”

The press conference was nearing its end. Everyone was focused on Spencer’s words rather than the ticking clock.

“It’s time for new waters to flow through the London Symphony.”

A mysterious answer flowed out.

Sizzle―!

A spicy smell stimulating appetite tickled the nose. It was ramen cooked in rich soybean paste broth. Moreover, finely chopped green onions and a cracked egg were added, making it a feast.

Even Chloe, a violist not known for her appetite, was wide-eyed and salivating.

“Please take care of my oppa―!”

She looked like the wife of a candidate running in a by-election. Who would have thought of Anseongtangmyeon as a midnight snack for orchestra members? Of course, it was all prepared by Im Hyera, but to think it would be carried out so efficiently.

“We should be the ones thanking you. Thanks to Yooha, we get to enjoy such delicious food every time.”

“Yooha, I heard that ordering food like this every night is a culture in Korea?”

“That was a good question, Michael. The technical term is ‘night snack’.”

Son Yooha seemed to have become more familiar with the members than I was. It’s no wonder, as she’s been marking her attendance almost every day.

Bringing midnight snacks herself for the members practicing late into the night made her seem like an angel to them.

By the time the ramen bowls were empty,

“Hyun, it’s tomorrow. Aren’t you nervous?”

It was Emanuel, the principal cellist. A week had passed quickly. Tomorrow, I had to conduct in front of the maestro. But since I hadn’t been on the podium even once, the members were naturally curious.

“Of course, I’m nervous.”

“Really? I thought you were confident since you always watch us practice.”

“I watched the practice to understand the playing characteristics of the members in detail. I wasn’t sure if a week was enough, but I have a rough idea.”

The members’ eyes widened. They were very curious since I said I understood their playing characteristics.

Seeing everyone looking at me curiously, I couldn’t help but explain. I shared the playing characteristics I had observed for each member.

For example, Emanuel’s bowing subtly changes in fast-paced sections.

In Chloe’s case, her index and middle fingers react late only to specific notes when pressing the fingerboard.

From Emanuel to the new member Christine, I recited the playing characteristics of dozens of members without missing anyone. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

At that moment, Dmitri shook his head as if he couldn’t believe it and spoke,

“If anyone else had said that, I wouldn’t have believed it. But since you corrected our postures and watched our performances, I believe you. Hyun, do you know what numerous guest conductors have said about the London Symphony?”

“Um, I don’t.”

“They said we are like wild animals. They said no one could easily control our players. While imitation was possible, only Maestro Spencer could truly play the grand instrument that is the London Symphony. I’m really looking forward to tomorrow.”

At that moment, Chloe, who had been watching cautiously, looked back and forth between me and Yooha.

“I’ve been curious for a while, what’s the relationship between Yooha and Hyun?”

“Chloe, what do you mean, relationship―!”

Before Chloe could finish her sentence, Son Yooha immediately showed her silver ring.

“Hyun, will you be able to conduct to my satisfaction?”

Kang Hyun answered without hesitation to the maestro’s question.

“I must win Maestro’s favor to learn conducting here. So, I must move Maestro’s heart somehow.”

“You’re confident?”

“Although I appear confident, I’m trembling inside.”

Already, dozens of members were waiting for the conductor in Barbican Hall. It was perhaps the first time conducting in such a large concert hall. Nevertheless, Kang Hyun maintained a calm demeanor. Spencer subtly asked Kang Hyun,

“What about the score?”

“For this conduction, I plan not to look at it.”

“You mean to memorize it?”

There are conductors who memorize the score. However, even great maestros didn’t necessarily memorize entire symphonies. Memorizing could lead to focusing on correcting errors, hindering the interpretation and technical execution of the piece.

Kang Hyun must have known this, yet he chose to memorize the score for his first conduction. Why?

“I want to maximize the members’ abilities.”

The maestro, understanding Kang Hyun’s intention, showed a peculiar expression. He wondered if this young boy even felt the word ‘nervous’ at all.

Even those who studied conducting professionally couldn’t do this. Moreover, it was with the incomparable instrument that is the London Symphony. It’s not just about keeping the tempo; he was also focusing on the members.

“I look forward to it.”

When the maestro left first, Kang Hyun adjusted his outfit in the empty waiting room. He handled the practice baton. Since it hadn’t been used yet, it was smooth with no sign of wear.

The tension pressing down on Kang Hyun’s shoulders was greater than when he took the bar exam in his previous life, but his heart was pounding uncontrollably.

Thump thump thump.

There was only one person in the audience. Only Maestro Spencer was watching the stage with bright eyes.

Kang Hyun slowly walked to the conductor’s podium and exchanged glances with the numerous members. The tension and silence wrapping Barbican Hall were immense, as if before a storm.

Dmitri, sitting at the forefront of the first violins, looked at Kang Hyun. At that moment, he was looking at Kang Hyun as the concertmaster of the London Symphony.

His gaze was so sharp that any mistake would surely halt Dmitri’s bow.

The reason numerous guest conductors failed with the London Symphony was simple. They lacked the talent to handle the enormous instrument and couldn’t withstand the pressure.

It was then.

When Kang Hyun looked around, the members finished their preparations in unison. The members, meeting Kang Hyun’s gaze, tried hard to suppress their surprise.

No longer was it the Kang Hyun who corrected their postures and helped their practice. His gaze was as intense as that of the maestro, if not more.

At that moment, the conductor’s left hand swept through the audience,

The baton in his right hand quickly cut through the air.

Dududung―!

Along with the thin, delicate movements of the baton, dozens of instruments began to sound in unison.

The members moved in perfect harmony to the baton’s direction of tempo, rhythm, and melody.

The movements of the baton were as intense as thunder striking.

The members couldn’t always keep the same tempo. Especially in Beethoven’s Fate Symphony, where three eighth notes must follow an eighth rest, it was even more so.

The members, as if standing in the middle of a battlefield, had to focus intensely on the conductor’s baton.

Maestro Spencer leaned forward in his seat. Wasn’t the opening of the first movement almost like a replica of himself?

If it were just an imitation, he wouldn’t have been so surprised. The shock was evident on concertmaster Dmitri’s face. The resemblance and emotional depth of the conducting were so identical that one might mistake it for Maestro Spencer himself standing at the podium.

At the end of the first movement,

Thud.

The conductor’s left hand crossed the air and clenched into a fist.

At that moment, Kang Hyun, standing on the podium, turned his back to the audience and bowed deeply. Though it would be impossible during a performance, it was acceptable now since it was an assessment. The members understood why Kang Hyun did what he did.

It was an expression of infinite glory and gratitude to Maestro Spencer for allowing him to stand in Barbican Hall. Then, Kang Hyun turned back.

“Now, let’s go with my style.”

With a short but firm statement, the members swallowed hard. At that moment, Maestro Spencer smiled faintly at the bold boy.

In a way, it was fortunate that the boy’s first proper conducting was shown with the London Symphony.

Didn’t Beethoven say about the beginning of the Fate Symphony,

-Fate knocks at the door like this.
