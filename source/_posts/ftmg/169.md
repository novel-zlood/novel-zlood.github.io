When I draw notes on the staff, my mind regains tranquility.

When countless musical ideas unfold from my long fingertips into a single song, my heart starts to flutter like that of a child strolling by a serene lakeside.

At that moment, my two hands crossed the air, causing ripples on the calm lakeside.

Gang Hyun Symphony No.2

My fingertips were as sharp as if holding a conductor's baton. There was no need to use a synthesizer. The melodies of numerous instruments resonated simultaneously in my mind.

The six notes decorating the beginning of the first movement resembled Beethoven's Symphony of Fate but were richer and felt like warm sunshine.

I gave directions towards the invisible score. The sequence of notes starting with the splendid tremolo of the strings was enough to captivate the audience's attention.

Amidst the rising emotions, I could feel the heartbeat pounding and even the single drop of sweat trickling down my forehead in detail.

Before I knew it, the small room had transformed into a concert hall.

It was the second symphony. In Kang Hyun's mind, dozens of instruments and members unfolded panoramically as if they were alive.

Sweat droplets splattered from my fingertips as they scattered.

As the conducting vigorously crossed the air and the timpani's resonance grew like an erupting volcano.

"No, I said it's fine."

At that moment, a voice broke the silence. My fingertips cautiously curled.

The members and audience in my head had long since faded away with a sense of regret. My mother was arguing with someone over the phone in the living room.

When our eyes met, my mother showed an awkward expression.

"Son, I'm sorry. Was my voice too loud?"

"No, it's okay. Was it that woman calling again?"

"No, it was another woman this time. She claims to be famous in Cheongdam-dong, but who knows."

It was a matchmaker. It must have started after I turned 20. Somehow, the matchmakers frequently called the house in Ichon-dong.

They even sought out my mother at the market and hair salon she frequents and approached her with determination.

For my mother, it was a new experience, but as a former prosecutor at the Western District Prosecutor's Office, I had grown sick of such things.

"Still, how can they suggest matchmaking to someone who just turned twenty?"

"Exactly."

"Son, you don't have a girlfriend yet, do you?"

My mother's eyes gleamed with curiosity like a young girl. Didn't I receive quite a few fan letters from female students after the British royal performance a few years ago?

Many female students at Korea University also approached me. It was quite different from my university life, where I was known as a 'tough nut' and focused on the bar exam.

"Mom thinks Yooha is really nice."

"What?"

I unintentionally raised my voice at that moment. My mother smiled faintly as she saw me hiccuping with a bobbing Adam's apple.

Chairman Wang looked down at the golden carp swimming in the pond. Their flawless scales and fins made their graceful appearance even more striking.

As he scattered the fish food, they eagerly swam toward it, with the largest golden carp standing out.

"It has a good appetite, just like you did when you were young, Son."

Chairman Wang turned his head at the sudden voice. Without his notice, his old friend Chairman Yoo was standing beside him.

"You old rascal, you should at least make your presence known when you arrive. Are you trying to give this old man a heart attack?"

"I couldn't find the right moment to speak as you seemed so engrossed. What, did you hide a gold nugget inside?"

"These days, there are many things that bring me joy just by watching."

Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo strolled through the garden, engaging in conversation. Both were over seventy but remarkably spry for their age.

They stopped in front of a pair of beautiful pine trees.

The pine trees, exuding beauty and elegance just by looking at them, faced each other like a couple who had shared roots for hundreds of years, creating a rather enchanting atmosphere.

"This tree was planted exactly when Yooha was born. It has grown quite a bit, hasn't it? Do you know what the tree beside it is?"

"What is it?"

"It's the one I planted when I first met Hyun. Over time, as they grew, their branches started facing each other, as if looking into each other's eyes."

Chairman Wang shared with Chairman Yoo the conversation he had with Kang Hyun. The sight of Kang Hyun, who had grown into a respectable businessman, was so radiant that it couldn’t be compared to the golden carp or pine trees.

"Who would have thought he'd persuade Beomjin like that? It's almost as if he recovered Dongju's shares effortlessly. He executes everything so smoothly and confidently, as if it's nothing."

"Son, it's the first time in decades I've seen you this excited."

"Indeed, in all my years in business, I've never encountered anyone like Hyun. His business acumen, along with his insight and deep thinking, makes me reflect a lot. If Hyun had been the head of a competing company decades ago, I would have been quite tense."

Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo lost track of time whenever they talked about Kang Hyun. After all, he was a kid who revealed new facets as layers peeled away like an onion. It was at that moment.

"A matchmaker?"

Chairman Wang widened his eyes and looked at Chairman Yoo.

Who would have thought that so many matchmakers would contact Kang Hyun, who had just turned twenty? Moreover, wasn’t it the kid Chairman Wang had marked?

If he could, he wanted to gather all the matchmakers in Gangnam and Cheongdam-dong and give them a stern scolding.

"Chairman Yoo, this won't do."

"What do you mean?"

"We should hold an engagement ceremony immediately. Who would have thought Hyun would be so harassed by matchmakers?"

Chairman Yoo smiled at his friend.

"Did you forget that Yooha is still in high school?"

"Ahem, in the old days, they would have been married already. An engagement ceremony should be fine."

Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo bantered back and forth as if they were in a duel.

Chairman Yoo didn't dislike Son Yooha, but the fact that she was too young was both a flaw and not. To be honest, he wanted to take his time and think about such matrimonial matters leisurely.

On the other hand, Chairman Wang was growing impatient. Yooha still had a few years before she became an adult. In the meantime, who knows what kind of women or matchmakers might approach Kang Hyun?

As the saying goes, you can know the depths of a thousand-fathom water but not the depths of a person's heart.

"Father-in-law, wouldn't it be a waste to close our eyes after only seeing the wedding?"

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, with our health still good, it would be a waste to die without seeing our grandchildren's weddings."

At that moment, Chairman Wang made an offer tempting enough to light up Chairman Yoo's eyes.

"Don't you want to see your great-grandchildren?"

Bzzz.

The Guarneri Fiore sang on Kang Hyun's shoulder. Lost in the beautiful melody that burst forth like a flower bud waiting to bloom, Kang Hyun soon put the Fiore down and grabbed the sheet music.

He was in the middle of the final work for his second album. Kang Hyun was busy drawing the sheet music for the last track to be included.

"Hyun, do you have a moment?"

At that moment, Director Im Hyera came to see Kang Hyun, holding something in her hand.

Despite weighing options between England's EMA and Germany's Deutsche, he ended up choosing the blank contract offered by EMA.

As he glanced over the newly drafted contract, Kang Hyun was taken aback.

"Director, are the terms really this favorable? And isn't the initial stock too much?"

"I made the terms slightly better than what Deutsche offered. The initial stock isn't too much, so don't worry. Hyun, sometimes you are very bold for your age, but at times like this, you seem a bit reserved?"

Perhaps it was Director Im Hyera who was bold. Kang Hyun couldn't help but be surprised by the amount and conditions written in the contract. It was comparable to the terms offered to renowned virtuosos.

On the other hand, Kang Hyun thought he had a very good supporter.

"So why are you suddenly adding a last track?"

"I originally planned to add it. It was a song I initially composed, but it needed some refinement."

"Refinement?"

Im Hyera didn't understand. She had heard the violin solo piece Kang Hyun intended to add, and it was already an excellent piece that needed no further refinement.

But Kang Hyun thought differently.

"I composed it without fully understanding my feelings at the time. I think I now know what the sense of discomfort I felt back then was."

Kang Hyun looked down at the sheet music he had just been revising. The notes on the staff, reflecting his excited heart, were incredibly lovely.

Who would know that this sheet music was a piece for a single audience?

* * *

Swoosh.

In Russia, Anna clenched her hand as she listened to the melody coming from the CDP. She was listening to Kang Hyun's second album right after its release.

The composition of the pieces was diverse, ranging from concertos to unaccompanied solos.

Especially Kang Hyun's solo pieces were enough to shake one's heart, reminiscent of Niccolò Paganini's Caprices and Bach's Chaconne.

The last track, in particular, seemed to evoke someone.

Anna felt an inexplicable sense of regret. She even wished that the last track was dedicated to her.

However, the beauty of the piece was unwavering, captivating her ears like an enchanting melody worthy of being called the devil's tune.

"The arrogant kid has grown tremendously."

Alexei, who was listening to the album with Anna, twitched his cheek.

As the dean of the Moscow Conservatory, he had met many geniuses, but none left a strong impression like Kang Hyun.

Listening to Kang Hyun's beautiful melodies, Alexei smirked.

Gulp—

Kang Hyun's second album resonated in the London Symphony's concert hall. The alternating melodies and the succession of musical ideas chasing each other's ends made the members' Adam's apples bob up and down.

The young maestro, who had shown a perfect conductor's form at the British royal performance, was now performing as a virtuoso, exhibiting a master's performance.

The long-rumored second album's tracks made the cold-eyed concertmaster and even Spencer, the heart of the London Symphony, smile in satisfaction.

"Truly remarkable."

A teacup with floating petals was lifted. The eternal maestro, Gustav, had a face filled with overwhelming happiness. Each track in the album seemed to lead him to a solo recital.

The regret of not being able to attend solo recitals due to his frail health was somewhat alleviated.

"Jascha Heifetz."

Gustav softly called the name of his old friend and rival violinist.

There was a story that the European masters who had visited Korea all agreed upon.

Kang Hyun's solo performance resembled that of Jascha Heifetz.

That was no lie. Although the form wasn't visible, the melodies heard in his ears were enough to tell. The emotional technique and the bow's tremor that touched the heartstrings couldn't be imitated.

Especially with the last track, Gustav couldn't hide his smile. It was a kind and warm smile, akin to a grandfather looking at his beloved grandchild. Who would have thought such a great piece would be included?

Even without seeing it, he could tell from the subtle trembling of the strings and the bow's movement.

This piece was for a single person, for a single audience.

"Indeed, a new era has begun, Jascha."
