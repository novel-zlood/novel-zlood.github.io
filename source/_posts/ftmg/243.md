"Billboard Chart?"

Im Hyera couldn't believe her ears. It was news that had come from America after a long time. Just then, Kim Mihyun showed her a fax from the U.S. to confirm it and said,

"President, as of midnight yesterday American time, the songs in Hyun's album have made it to the Billboard singles chart. Especially, Gang Hyun Symphony No.1, which is orchestrated as a symphony, has already entered the top 30!"

It was unbelievable. Had there ever been a South Korean artist who adorned the Billboard?

Moreover, it wasn't even the Billboard classical chart but the singles chart. Even famous classical musicians who sold millions of albums worldwide found it hard to make it onto Billboard.

This result was only possible because of the perfect blend of fame, completeness of the piece, and commercial success.

"What on earth is going on?"

"According to rumors from America, not only Hollywood and broadcasting industry insiders but even teenagers are spreading word of Hyun. For instance, there are talks of calling Hyun a mysterious genius boy or even the reincarnation of Mozart. Because of this, Hyun's album, which was officially released in the U.S. only a few months ago, is becoming so popular that it’s causing a shortage."

"Among students?"

Im Hyera had also studied abroad in her younger years. However, no matter how much she thought about it, even in Vienna, Austria, known as the city of music, there were not many students who enjoyed classical music.

Let alone classical music in the U.S., where pop and hip-hop dominate.

Could it be that someone manipulated the chart through bulk buying?

No way, such manipulation only worked in Korea. If the American music market was described as a mega-market, then the Korean music market could be compared to a small neighborhood store.

There's a saying that if you record a ranking on the Billboard singles chart, you can live off it for three generations. That's how impossible it is to manipulate the Billboard singles chart.

"By the way, didn't Hyun have a recording in America today?"

At Im Hyera's question, Kim Mihyun nodded briefly.

"Yes, President. It's a program called Elnon Show, hosted by Elnon Fox. Although it's in a pilot format, ABA has put a lot of effort into it."

"Still, it's just a talk show. Appearing on it won't make him more famous, right?"

"Since it's the first broadcast, it won't be that impactful. Music critics who study the Billboard charts also believe that Hyun's album won't last more than a month on the chart. Still, it's an unprecedented event for a Korean, so the newspapers and news will probably start reporting from today."

Im Hyera also thought Kang Hyun's entry on the Billboard might be a fleeting event. That's why she didn't make a fuss.

After all, American teenagers generally don't like classical music, and while Hyun was appearing as a guest on the Elnon Show, she doubted whether Hyun could really resonate with Americans. There was certainly a difference in humor between the East and the West.

Even if he finished the talk show recording well, it wouldn't make a huge splash. But there was something Im Hyera had overlooked.

It was only natural. No one but Kang Hyun knew about it. If you looked at Kang Hyun's past, he had spent as much time abroad as he had in Korea, and moreover, he was an avid viewer of the Elnon Show, so he knew exactly what kind of emotions they wanted.

* * *

"Isn't this your first talk show?"

Elnon was inwardly amazed. The reason was simple. Kang Hyun was incredibly suited for television.

Even though it was a talk show, only a simple Q&A script was typically provided.

Moreover, Elnon, who valued liveliness as a comedian, also valued the sincerity that came from the heart in a talk show. In that sense,

"Is he a broadcasting genius?"

Kang Hyun had such outstanding talent in broadcasting that he could be called an all-around entertainer.

His adept and relaxed demeanor, as if he had filmed talk shows and other programs hundreds of times, and his ad-libs that heated up the audience made it feel like he was conversing with a veteran entertainer.

"Elnon, there were definitely people who ignored me when I first arrived in England. Probably because I was Asian and young. One day, while I was walking, a random thug made a gesture of pulling his eyes and said to me, 'Hey, yellow monkey!' So guess what I did?"

"What did you do?"

"I flared my nostrils and said, 'Hey, chimpanzee!' His nostrils were rather large. Then he rushed at me. At the time, I was small, so he probably thought he could win with one punch. But that day, he got a nasty surprise from me. He might still be watching this show. Chimpanzee, I'm sorry for making fun of your nostrils that day. But if you make another racist comment, I'll make sure you walk on all fours like a real chimpanzee."

Even a globally sensitive issue like racial discrimination was handled smoothly.

That wasn't all. Elnon couldn't hide her amazement at how well Kang Hyun's sense of humor was. Thanks to that, laughter never ceased in the audience.

"Hyun, it seems like American comedians might need to learn humor from you. I had no idea you were this good at talking."

Kang Hyun waved his hand as if it was nothing.

It was the same afterward. Since the talk show covered various topics, numerous questions were exchanged, but Kang Hyun answered without hesitation, even to tricky questions.

Moreover, he knew American sensibilities so well that it often left Elnon speechless.

Even during the short breaks given during the recording, it was the same. Elnon felt a strong urge to keep talking to Kang Hyun, even during the breaks.

"Hyun, how about adding this to the program for the next recording?"

Kang Hyun sketched a short surprise program he had in mind on a white paper, and Elnon looked at it with interest.

Even to Elnon, who was a famous comedian and a renowned TV writer, it was quite an intriguing idea.

"Hyun, I'm sure the ghost producer will love this content!"

"Right?"

"I'm curious to know where you get such ideas. The producers are already screaming with joy, and it hasn't even been two hours since we started recording."

Initially, the broadcasting station staff worried that violinist Kang Hyun might be too static for a talk show, but they soon realized their concerns were unfounded once the recording started.

"Hyun, do you usually enjoy watching American talk shows? Or are there many such programs in Korea?"

"There are talk shows in Korea hosted by famous comedians, but I haven't really watched them. It's the same with American shows. Actually, I came here thinking I shouldn't be too serious. If I answer too seriously, the talk show could turn into a documentary, right? Elnon, am I doing well?"

"Oh my god, are you kidding? You're one of the best speakers among the celebrities I've met. Especially how well you understand the American code, it's astonishing. You must have lived in America in your past life!"

"Not in England?"

Kang Hyun continued to joke until the end. Elnon felt her prejudice that his talent was limited to one area completely shattered.

On the contrary, he was grasping the essence of the talk show like a fish in water. Anyone who didn't know might mistake Kang Hyun as the host of the Elnon Show, he was so proactive.

No matter how much she thought about it, Kang Hyun undoubtedly had immense talent in broadcasting.

* * *

"Hyun, aren't you nervous?"

It was a question Elnon had asked Kang Hyun before the recording started. How could he be nervous? Instead, Hyun's eyes were filled with uncontainable excitement.

Of course, it was a lie if he said he wasn't thrilled to be the first guest on a program he had avidly watched in his past life.

"I'm getting more curious about the violinist Hyun this morning."

"Elnon, it's not morning, it's night."

"What? But the recording time is still in the morning?"

"Don't the viewers watch Elnon's talk show while preparing dinner? Then our time is also night."

Since it was a program he enjoyed watching in his past life, he could see how Elnon would proceed with the talk show without even looking at the script.

But perhaps because it was the first recording, Elnon seemed more nervous than Kang Hyun.

Kang Hyun played the role of a relaxant to ease Elnon's nerves and invigorated the talk show's proceedings.

"Hyun, do you have a girlfriend?"

"In Korea, there's a saying: 'A quiet cat climbs on the stove first.'"

"What does that mean?"

Kang Hyun answered with a faint smile. Like a guest who had been on the Elnon Show many times, Kang Hyun couldn't hide his comfortable feeling.

That was understandable given how avidly he had watched the Elnon Show in his past life. Although Elnon didn't know, Kang Hyun was familiar with her unique gestures. After that gesture...

Whoosh―!

Suddenly, a person popped out from under the table in the center of the talk show set. It was a surprise to prank the guest.

Although Kang Hyun knew it was coming, he pretended to be startled, clutching his chest. His reaction was so good that Elnon and the producer couldn't help but smile.

"Hyun, for the audience who came all the way to New York to attend today's talk show and the viewers watching on TV, could you give a short performance?"

"Hmm, I don't like it."

"What? Did you hurt your fingers, or are you not feeling well today?"

"No, I'm in top condition today. But I didn't like Elnon's comment just now. How could I, as the first guest on the Elnon Show, have the honor of performing on stage and only give a short performance? Ideally, I'd like to hold a concert here."

Kang Hyun's cheeky response made the audience burst into laughter. As Kang Hyun stepped onto the stage, his eyes changed in an instant.

The face that had been full of laughter just moments ago was now extremely serious, and his hands gripping the violin and bow were more cautious than ever. This meant he didn't take the Elnon Show stage lightly.

As if flowing like water, he took the violin position and gently closed his eyes.

The audience, Elnon, and the broadcasting staff held their breath and listened. Only the cameraman, sweating from his hands, was zooming in on Kang Hyun.

Seeing violinist Hyun, Elnon felt her heart pound.
