"Billboard chart?"

Im Hyera couldn't believe her ears. It was news from the US after a long time. At that moment, Kim Mihyun showed her a fax from the US to confirm it and said,

"CEO, as of midnight yesterday US time, the songs from Hyun's album have entered the Billboard singles chart. Especially, Gang Hyun's Symphony No.1, arranged for orchestra, has already entered the top 30 of the charts!"

It was unbelievable news. Had there ever been a South Korean singer who made it to the Billboard charts?

Moreover, it wasn't even the Billboard classical chart but the singles chart. Even famous classical musicians who sold millions of albums worldwide found it difficult to make their names on the Billboard charts.

Such a result is possible only when the three factors of fame, song quality, and commerciality are perfectly combined.

"What's going on?"

"According to rumors from the US, not only Hollywood and TV industry insiders but even teenagers are spreading word-of-mouth about Hyun. For example, some call Hyun a mysterious genius boy or even the reincarnation of Mozart. Because of this, Hyun's album, officially released just a few months ago in the US, is so popular that it's becoming scarce."

"Among students?"

Im Hyera also had experience studying abroad in her youth. However, no matter how much she looked back, even in Vienna, Austria, known as the city of music, the number of students who enjoyed classical music wasn't that high.

Let alone in the US, where pop and hip-hop dominate.

Could someone have manipulated the charts through bulk buying?

No way, such manipulation would only work in Korea. The US music market was a gigantic market compared to Korea's, which could be described as a small neighborhood store.

There’s even a saying that if you rank on the Billboard singles chart, it’s enough to feed three generations. That's how difficult it is to manipulate the Billboard singles chart.

"By the way, isn't Hyun recording a program in the US today?"

At Im Hyera's question, Kim Mihyun nodded briefly.

"Yes, CEO. It's the Ellen Show hosted by Ellen Fox. Although it's a pilot, ABA has put a lot of effort into the program."

"But it's just a simple talk show. Appearing on it won't make him any more famous, right?"

"Since it's the first broadcast, it won't have a huge impact. Even music critics who study the Billboard charts believe Hyun's album won't last more than a month. Still, it's an unprecedented event for a Korean, so the newspapers and news will start reporting from today."

Im Hyera also thought Hyun's entry into Billboard might just be a fleeting event. That's why she didn't make a fuss about it.

After all, American teenagers generally don't like classical music, and even though Hyun was appearing as a guest on the Ellen Show, she was skeptical about whether Hyun could truly resonate with American emotions. The humor between East and West was certainly different.

Even if the talk show recording went well, it probably wouldn't make a huge splash. However, there was something Im Hyera overlooked.

It was natural. No one except Kang Hyun knew. Looking at Hyun's past life, he had as much experience living abroad as he did in Korea, and he was an avid viewer of the Ellen Show, so he knew what emotions they wanted.

"Isn't this your first talk show?"

Ellen was inwardly amazed. The reason was simple. Kang Hyun was incredibly suited for the broadcast.

Even in a talk show, only a general script for Q&A is provided.

Moreover, Ellen, being a comedian who valued liveliness, also valued heartfelt sincerity in a talk show. In that sense,

"Is he a broadcasting genius?"

Kang Hyun had such exceptional talent in broadcasting that he could be called an all-around entertainer.

His proficient and relaxed atmosphere, as if he had filmed talk shows hundreds of times, and his ad-libs that heated up the audience were so skillful that it felt like talking with a veteran entertainer.

"Ellen, there were definitely people who ignored me in England at first. Probably because I was Asian and young. One day, while walking down the street, a thug I didn’t know made a gesture of stretching his eyes and said to me, 'Hey, yellow monkey!' So, what did I do?"

"What did you do?"

"I flared my nostrils and said, 'Hey, chimpanzee!' because he had really big nostrils. Then he ran at me. He probably thought he could beat me with one punch because I was small. But that day, he learned a harsh lesson from me. I wonder if he's watching this show now. Chimpanzee, I'm sorry for making fun of your nostrils that day. But if you demean another race again, I'll make sure you walk on all fours like a real chimpanzee."

Even a globally sensitive issue like racial discrimination was handled smoothly.

That wasn’t all. Ellen was astonished by Kang Hyun's remarkable sense of humor and numerous humor skills. Thanks to him, the audience couldn’t stop laughing.

"Hyun, it seems American comedians need to learn humor from you? I never knew you spoke so well."

Kang Hyun waved his hand as if it was nothing.

It was the same after that. Since the talk show covered various topics, many questions were asked, but Kang Hyun answered without hesitation even to tricky questions.

Moreover, he had such a good understanding of American sensibilities that he left Ellen speechless.

Even during a short break in the recording, Ellen felt a strong urge to keep talking with Kang Hyun.

"Hyun, how about adding this to the program content for the next recording?"

Kang Hyun sketched a short surprise program on a white sheet, and Ellen looked at it with interest.

Even as a comedian and a famous writer, Ellen found the content quite interesting.

"Hyun, Ghost PD will love this content!"

"Right?"

"I'm curious about where these ideas come from. The PDs are already ecstatic, and it's been less than two hours since the recording started."

Initially, the broadcasting officials thought that as a violinist, Kang Hyun might be too reserved for a talk show. But immediately after the recording started, they realized their concerns were unfounded.

"Hyun, do you usually watch American talk shows? Are there many such programs in Korea?"

"There are talk shows hosted by famous comedians in Korea, but I haven't watched them properly. The same goes for American shows. Honestly, I came today thinking I shouldn't mess up. If I answer too seriously, the talk show will turn into a documentary, right? Ellen, am I doing well?"

"Oh my god, are you kidding me? Hyun, you’re one of the best speakers among the celebrities I've ever met. Especially, I’m amazed at how well you understand American humor. You must have lived in America in a past life!"

"Not England?"

Kang Hyun continued joking until the end. Watching him, Ellen felt her preconception that his talent was limited was completely shattered.

Instead, he grasped the essence of the talk show like a fish in water. An outsider might mistake Kang Hyun for the host of the Ellen Show. He was that dominant.

No matter how you looked at it, Kang Hyun clearly had immense talent for broadcasting.

* * *

"Hyun, aren't you nervous?"

This was a question Ellen asked Kang Hyun before the recording started. How could he be nervous? Rather, there was undeniable excitement in Kang Hyun's eyes.

Of course, being the first guest on a show he had loved in his past life, it would be a lie to say he wasn’t thrilled.

"A morning full of curiosity about violinist Hyun."

"Ellen, it's night, not morning."

"What? It's still morning during the recording."

"Aren't viewers watching your talk show while preparing dinner? Then, it's night for us too."

Having been an avid viewer of the show in his past life, Kang Hyun could envision how Ellen would proceed with the talk show without even looking at the script.

But perhaps because it was the first recording, Ellen seemed more nervous than Kang Hyun.

Kang Hyun played the role of a relaxant easing Ellen's tension while also energizing the talk show.

"Hyun, do you have a girlfriend?"

"In Korea, there's a saying. A quiet cat gets on the stove first."

"What does that mean?"

Kang Hyun answered with a faint smile. He couldn't hide his comfort, as if he had been a guest on the Ellen Show for a long time.

That was natural, considering how much he had loved the Ellen Show in his past life. Although Ellen didn't know, Kang Hyun was well aware of her characteristic gestures. After that move,

Wow―!

Suddenly, a person jumped out from under the table in the center of the talk show. It was a surprise to prank the guest.

Although Kang Hyun already knew, he pretended to be surprised, clutching his chest. His reaction was so good that Ellen and the PD couldn't stop smiling.

"Hyun, for the audience who came from New York and the viewers watching on TV, could you give a short performance?"

"Hmm, I don’t like it."

"What? Did you hurt your finger or are you not feeling well today?"

"No, my condition is perfect today. But I didn't like Ellen's previous comment. How could you say just a short performance when I have the honor of performing as the first guest on the Ellen Show? I'd like to hold a concert here if possible."

Kang Hyun's witty answer made the audience burst into laughter. His gaze changed instantly as he stepped onto the stage.

The laughter that had filled his face until a moment ago disappeared, replaced with utmost seriousness as he held the violin and bow with unprecedented caution. It meant he didn't take the Ellen Show's stage lightly.

As he assumed the violin position fluidly and gently closed his eyes,

The audience, Ellen, and the broadcasting staff held their breaths and listened intently. Only the camera director, with sweaty palms, zoomed in on Kang Hyun's face.
