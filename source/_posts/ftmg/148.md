Spencer's sharp eyes swept over the members as if stirring their souls.

It was a rehearsal proceeding without a concertmaster. The first violin assistant, who took on the role, was having a hard time.

The degree of pressure was more severe than usual. Even simple mistakes were not tolerated as if it were a real performance.

Like an eagle catching a fish beneath the water in one swift motion.

"Cello―!"

The cello section member flinched. It was a minute pitch difference that others might not notice, but Spencer did not allow it.

Despite there being no audience in the seats, the members' foreheads were beaded with sweat, showing how tense the rehearsal was.

"Again―!"

Spencer pointed to the horn with his long finger, indicating to start over from the first movement.

The horn and bassoon section members, who were responsible for the introduction, relaxed their tense shoulders.

It was a rehearsal that had been going on for hours, yet no one complained. It was proof of how much they trusted the maestro.

At that moment.

Snap.

Spencer raised his arm with his unsound shoulder and clenched his fist, signaling a short break. Only then did all the members relax their tense shoulders and exhale the breaths they had been holding.

Principal cellist Emanuel only realized the reason for the break when he looked up. Beyond his gaze, concertmaster Dmitri was just entering.

"You said he wouldn't attend?"

Spencer's eyes shook as if in shock. But soon, they became bright again as if a shaken wick had been relit. His wrinkled cheeks twitched slightly. Who would have thought a conductor would decline a royal performance!

"He said it would be difficult to adjust his schedule at the moment."

"Dmitri, did you explain what this performance means?"

"Of course, Maestro."

A sigh mixed with a groan escaped from Spencer's lips. No one in England was unaware of the significance of a royal performance. Moreover, Dmitri, the concertmaster of the London Symphony, wouldn't have explained it inadequately.

For a violinist, if Brussels was a dream stage, for conductors, the royal performance was the ultimate dream stage. Proof of this was that famous conductors from America and Asia had chosen to go to England without hesitation upon being called.

"I need to hear the reason."

"Maestro, Hyun is currently composing a symphony."

"You're talking about a symphony?" 

Spencer's eyes widened. Who would have thought Hyun was in the middle of composing a symphony.

If it were compositions he had shown at solo concerts, it wouldn't be impossible. He was regarded as a genius among geniuses.

On the other hand, a great curiosity surged in, like a tidal wave. He was very curious about what story Hyun's composition would tell.

"At first, I thought it was just the arrogance of a young musician. Even if he was composing a symphony, I thought the royal performance was more important. But after hearing the unfinished first movement, I changed my mind."

"Changed?"

"I asked him to choose England after completing the symphony if he felt moved. I couldn't interrupt Hyun's time any longer. To exaggerate, the story Hyun is writing gave me a stronger impact than any piece I've ever heard."

Dmitri's cold eyes were blazing hot. Spencer licked his dry lips as if he had been waiting.

It seemed like giving Hyun excessive benefits compared to other conductors, but he didn't care. What kind of symphony had Hyun presented to make the calm concertmaster so excited?

Gulp―!

Baek Junghoon's Adam's apple moved up and down significantly. Baek Junghoon couldn't take his eyes off the sheet music, like a student holding the test paper of a lifetime.

Was this how a Joseon-era diplomat felt when he first encountered Western culture? The admiration showed no sign of stopping as he turned the pages.

How much time had passed? Baek Junghoon's eyes were filled with deep emotion and excitement when he lifted his head.

"Crazy."

Just three words. There couldn't be a better assessment to describe the sheet music. All the changes in his heart were contained in that concise expression.

The prelude began with the intense melody of the horn piercing through the twilight.

The orchestral sound was imitating the galloping triplets of the piano, like the sound of horse hooves echoing.

Right, now!

Amid the low bass of the cellos and violas creating the shape of the fog, the dynamic dawn melody began, awakening everyone. Especially in the choral section, the emotions reached an absolute peak.

Baek Junghoon couldn't regain his composure amid the orchestral feast resonating in his mind.

"Hyung, are you okay?"

At that moment, Baek Junghoon raised his head sharply at Kang Hyun's voice. Looking at the boy in front of him, Baek Junghoon felt anew the wall of talent.

Did this boy really understand the kind of music he had created?

Surely, if this symphony were released to the world, many musicians would cheer, while many others would experience despair. Just as the sounds of Mozart's era had done.

"How did you decide on the arrangement?"

"Horns and bassoons, flutes and oboes, clarinets, trumpets, timpani, five strings, and in the second and fourth movements, cymbals, bass drums, and trombones are added. Of course, there's also a mixed four-part chorus."

Words failed him. Baek Junghoon felt as if Kang Hyun were a monster. He himself was called a prodigy from a young age, but this was on another level.

Moreover, wasn't this his first composed symphony? Of course, musicians who left marks in history always acted extraordinarily. Even a few decades ago, look at Yehudi Menuhin.

But Kang Hyun was on a different path. Baek Junghoon couldn't let go of the sheet music, as if facing a historical moment.

He couldn't face this reality nonchalantly.

"Hyun-ah, have you heard it?"

"Of course, hyung."

Did he listen to it through mechanical sounds? But Kang Hyun just chuckled and tapped his head with his fingers.

Ah, he must not have premiered it with mechanical sounds. A grand orchestra already resided in that child's mind.

"In fact, there's still a lot to refine."

"Where exactly?"

"Although the score is complete, I can't quite figure out how the performers will breathe. Especially the choral part, which is quite unfamiliar to me, so I'm pretty nervous."

That's a lie. Kang Hyun's eyes were already full of excitement, as if they had swallowed the word 'nervous.'

It was hard to believe there were parts to refine. Probably, Kang Hyun was acting modestly for Baek Junghoon's sake.

"Hyun-ah, where do you plan to premiere it?"

For a musician, nothing was more important than the premiere. Moreover, the role Kang Hyun took in the symphony was none other than the conductor. Hence, he needed performers he could truly trust.

"For now, I'm planning to ask in London. Although it might be after the royal performance is allowed."

"London Symphony?"

"Yes, but it might already be too late. I heard all the prominent conductors are heading to England. Still, I'm excited to see the members again after a long time. I wonder how much more they've improved."

Though he said that, he didn't look scared at all. He was already accustomed to meeting the world's best orchestra.

Kang Hyun had truly come to love music.

Just then, Im Hyera, the director, called for Kang Hyun. Only after the boy disappeared from his sight did Baek Junghoon swipe his thick palm over his face.

He thought he had almost caught up, but the boy had already advanced far ahead.

A surge of overwhelming emotions swirled in Baek Junghoon's heart.

Suddenly, I wondered if this was how a general feels going to war. As I moved out of the airport, my shoulders felt heavy.

It wasn't because I had a lot of luggage. The overwhelming support made me feel like I had to conduct at the British Royal Court.

Even the principal wanted to hang a banner, calling me the face of the school.

‘You rascal, are you off to shoot another movie?’

Old Master Wang's voice echoed in my head. He looked at me with expectant eyes, hoping I'd meet Yooha when I mentioned going abroad, like a mischievous child.

But if I were to conduct at the British Royal Court, I wouldn't have time to relax. I had to be perfect with no margin for error.

By the way.

Tap, tap, tap―!

As if a tiger were getting married, a torrential downpour fell from the clear sky. Luckily, I had prepared an umbrella, or I would have looked like a drenched rat.

I walked out of the airport and looked for Chrissy. Since she had acted as my guardian in England and Germany before, she was indispensable for this trip as well.

"A blue van."

While searching for the blue van Chrissy mentioned, I turned around and found it parked behind me.

Chrissy had said she had some errands in the morning and would send a driver.

I knocked on the trunk, and it opened as if waiting. There was no sign of help, so I loaded my luggage and got into the back seat by myself.

'That's unusual.'

The driver didn't look in the rearview mirror once and started driving as soon as I closed the back seat door.

Judging by his appearance, he seemed Asian, but I wondered if he couldn't speak English.

Proof of this was that the driver didn't say a word the entire way to the London Symphony.

But his driving skills were excellent.

Wang Chun is a newbie who recently joined the Jinwang Group.

Having climbed the ranks well, he had the luck of becoming the chauffeur for the owner's family at a young age. When Wang Chun joined Jinwang Group, his family was so overjoyed that they even held a village feast, slaughtering a pig.

It was natural. In China, Jinwang Group was a shortcut to social elevation.

But who would have thought he would come to the UK branch so soon.

-Bring the young master.

The eldest son of Jinwang Group didn't engage in management. Rumor had it he pursued music, but Wang Chun had never seen him properly.

Not only did he have no interest in music, but he had never listened to classical music. Moreover, Jinwang Group's eldest daughter was more known as the successor than the eldest son.

-Be careful and respectful. He is said to be sensitive and picky.

Rumor had it that he didn't stick to formalities. The fact that he only called for one driver to meet him was proof of that.

Then, someone knocked on the trunk of the blue van. It was obvious who it was without looking. It had to be the young master.

-Act tactfully. Keep silent until he speaks.

He was said to have a sensitive and picky personality befitting a musician, so Wang Chun carefully picked up the young master.

He couldn't even imagine looking at his face through the rearview mirror. He was worried he might upset him.

As soon as he heard the young master lean back in the rear seat, he cautiously stepped on the accelerator. A bead of sweat ran down Wang Chun's forehead as he concentrated on the smooth cornering.

When I opened my eyes after a short nap and looked out the window, I saw an unusual landscape. The car, which should have been heading to the London Symphony, seemed to be going in a completely different direction.

Instead of the crowded city, we were heading towards a wooded suburb.

Soon, a mansion as grand as those in Pyeongchang-dong appeared.

The iron gate opened automatically, leading to a long garden. In terms of size, it seemed larger than combining the mansions in Pyeongchang-dong and Ichon-dong.

Where the heck is this?

"We have arrived, young master."

Young master?

It was definitely Cantonese. Though with nine tones, it could sound complicated, the driver spoke with utmost respect.

Upon closer look, he was sweating nervously, unable to meet my eyes. Anyone would think I was about to eat him.

Moreover, before I could say a word, others rushed to open the door and unload my luggage from the trunk.

"Young master, welcome―!"

At that moment, I saw a white-haired butler running out of the mansion.

The situation made no sense. Why was I being called young master, and where was this place?

The butler's eyes widened as he approached.

"Who are you?"

Damn.
