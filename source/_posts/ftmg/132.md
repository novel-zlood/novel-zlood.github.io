-Hyunja, what shame brought you here?

- I've never had a brother like that.

- They say he's Hyunja's son.

These were the words I heard when I visited my grandfather's funeral in my past life. I was nineteen when I first learned of my grandfather's existence. The gazes of my cousins when we first met were not welcoming. They openly displayed their displeasure as if dealing with an uninvited guest.

- Hey, don't get in the way.

It was my first encounter with Yoo Jinseok. I wanted to smack Yoo Jinseok on the head right then and there, but what could I do? At that time, I was just a nineteen-year-old high school student with nothing to my name.

However, my mother cried as if the world had ended. She shed such sorrowful tears towards the harsh father who never contacted her after marrying my father that it made my heart ache.

But seeing her like that made my uncles and aunts visibly uncomfortable. They probably warned her off, worried that she might be interested in my grandfather's inheritance.

-Hyunja, I hope this is the last time I see you. Don't cause any more trouble on father's way out.

Oh, please, if someone saw him, they'd think he made a heroic decision for the nation. My eldest uncle's voice and eyes were filled with greed.

I silently stared at my grandfather's portrait. The grandfather in the picture was an old man with piercing eyes. He exuded charisma, as if he might burst out of the photo and roar at any moment.

‘So, he did succeed.’

I remember that there were some well-known politicians and entrepreneurs among the mourners. It seemed my grandfather's social standing was higher than I had thought.

Even amidst the unceasing line of mourners, my grandfather's portrait caught my eye.

‘Why are you staring so intently? He's already gone.’

I wasn't sad about my grandfather's death in my past life. I had never even seen his face. Rather, it ignited a spark for success in me.

The stark contrast between my wealthy uncles and my mother, whose hands were calloused and face wrinkled, struck me deeply.

Thirty minutes at the funeral was enough. I had no right to mourn the death of a grandfather I had never met.

By the way.

‘How on earth did you live your life?’

My uncles and aunts were endlessly talking about inheritance, even at the funeral. They barely pretended to receive mourners and showed no respect for the deceased.

It was clear that my grandfather had failed spectacularly in raising his children.

* * *

“In the chairman’s case, it's essential hypertension, which can develop suddenly without symptoms. It would be best to have a thorough examination after getting some rest. Chronic hypertension can lead to orthostatic hypotension or edema, which can further result in myocardial infarction or renal failure. It's fortunate that he remains physically robust for his age; otherwise, it could have been serious.”

Listening to the doctor’s explanation, I looked at my grandfather lying peacefully in bed.

The sharpness in his eyes was gone, replaced by deep wrinkles and liver spots. His once firm fists now had deep needle marks.

Although he seemed like he could get up at any moment, my grandfather did not easily open his eyes.

“Ajumma, can you get me some ice water?”

My aunt ordered the housekeeper as if she had neither hands nor feet.

The Icheon-dong mansion was now filled with my uncles, aunts, and their spouses. As soon as my grandfather fell ill, they seized the opportunity.

“What will you oppas do next?”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, father suddenly collapsed, and there’s no guarantee it won’t happen again. We should prepare as much as possible in advance.”

Oh, look at the world’s most filial daughter. What great unfilial behavior.

But my uncles’ faces showed signs of concern. The image of the three siblings from the funeral in my past life overlapped in my mind.

“I just need to expand my husband's hospital.”

“What?”

“Well, you brothers are going to split the company anyway. Isn’t it unfair that I don’t get anything?”

If my grandfather were healthy, my aunt’s forehead would not be intact by now.

My uncle-in-law watched the situation with an awkward expression. He seemed intent on just watching and benefiting. Despite not being a skilled doctor, his greed was immense.

‘Tsk.’

What was absurd was that my uncles were taking my aunt’s words seriously.

No wonder. My youngest uncle had confidently moved into the Icheon-dong mansion despite being the reason for my grandfather's collapse.

I felt like grabbing a kitchen spoon and hitting them all on the head.

“Jinseok, take the cousins upstairs for now. This is a conversation for adults.”

Only then did they seem to remember the young children. Yoo Jinseok, the oldest among the cousins, led the younger ones upstairs, and I was among them.

“Close the door.”

Yoo Jinseok was sweating profusely, nervous about my presence. The other cousins were the same. No one dared to speak loudly.

I sat on a chair in the corner of the room, deep in thought.

“Jinseok hyung.”

“Yes, yes.”

“Why is our aunt like that?”

Yoo Jinseok couldn’t answer, looking like a mute who had eaten honey. It was a stark contrast to how he dominated the cousins before I arrived.

Well, what fault does this young boy have? As they say, the fish rots from the head. But still.

‘Damn it—!’

As soon as my grandfather was absent, my uncles and aunts revealed their true colors.

They must have been dreaming of a happy future right now, with Dongju, a coveted prey, right in front of them.

“Jinseok hyung, come here.”

I beckoned Yoo Jinseok with my finger. He seemed to shrink, perhaps remembering the time he got hit by me. How could such a cowardly boy end up conning people in the future?

On the other hand, he was useful to me. Yoo Jinseok was an excellent spy to keep an eye on my aunt.

You ask if it’s okay to lie? Come on, I wouldn’t take Jinseok’s words at face value anyway.

If he lies, I can always punch him in the stomach again.

“Jinseok, let me ask you something.”

Just as Yoo Jinseok swallowed nervously,

Crash—!

The sound of something falling and loud shouting came from outside. I sprang up and burst through the door.

Heading to the living room, I was met with an unexpected sight. My father was grabbing my youngest uncle by the collar, glaring fiercely.

“What do you think you're doing with father lying here—!”

My father’s booming voice echoed through the Icheon-dong mansion.

* * *

“Chairman Yoo collapsed?”

Chairman Wang’s face showed deep concern. It was understandable, as his close friend had suddenly collapsed, making his heart sink.

Hearing the details from Secretary Kim, Chairman Wang nodded.

“Shall we prepare to leave now, sir?”

“No, there's no point in visiting an unconscious Chairman Yoo now. Collapsed due to high blood pressure, huh.”

Just a few days ago, Chairman Yoo had brought him a wild ginseng for his health. He had neglected his own health while caring for his friend.

Moreover, like his own sons, Chairman Yoo’s family also had significant concerns.

At that moment, Son Ilsung entered the drawing-room and widened his eyes upon hearing the news.

“Father, did Chairman Yoo collapse?”

“Yes, his blood pressure spiked and he collapsed.”

“He seemed quite healthy, didn’t he?”

Life is truly unpredictable. At his advanced age, it wasn’t surprising he could be knocked down by a gust of wind.

Fortunately, it wasn’t a severe illness. With some rest and recuperation, he could recover. But still.

“Dongju should be reinforcing its position right about now.”

“Chairman Yoo was planning to expand the new materials factory, right?”

“Yes, the timing is quite unfortunate. He should be directly overseeing the business, but now he’s bedridden.”

The core of Dongju was absent. It was clear that someone would try to fill that void.

Management is a world of survival of the fittest, where any weakness could be exploited.

Would blood relations be any different? On the contrary, being family might make them even more brazen.

“What do you think will happen to Dongju now, Ilsung?”

“Most likely, Chairman Yoo’s children will try to get involved in the business. It’s an ideal opportunity for them to solidify their positions while their father is incapacitated. Especially the second son, who will eagerly jump in.”

“Yes, Dongju faces a significant crisis.”

Anyone would think Chairman Yoo and I were on bad terms. But that wasn’t the case. Chairman Wang had a completely different scenario in mind.

“However, for someone else, this might be a test.”

I was already curious about how Kang Hyun would handle this crisis.

* * *

It was the first time I saw my father so angry. In my past life, he always seemed like a stoic head of the family.

When he worked at Dongju Chemical instead of the laundromat, my father was more like a scholar, as my grandfather said. He was more suited to being a researcher than a businessman.

But who knew he had such a beastly side hidden within him?

My youngest uncle, held by the collar, couldn’t even lift his head. The momentum was so intense that even my eldest uncle and aunt were stunned into silence.

The youngest uncle, who was gasping like a fish, had to endure my father’s harsh words.

“Mother, was father always this bold?”

“Your father is always kind and gentle and rarely gets angry, but he knows right from wrong. Didn’t I tell you how I met your father?”

“How did you meet him?”

My father had saved my mother when she was surrounded by thugs.

Even during the Yushin regime, there were always gangsters around. My father even ended up in the hospital for a while because of that.

“When your father regained consciousness in the hospital, do you know what he said to me?”

“What did he say?”

“With an incredibly serious face, he said, ‘I just did what I had to do.’ But he looked so worried and nervous. It turned out he was more concerned about the hospital bills than his injuries. And yet, he still kindly asked if I was hurt.”

No wonder my wealthy mother fell for my father.

Today’s events did relieve some of the pent-up frustration. If my grandfather were in his right mind, he would have applauded my father’s actions.

But this was not enough. My uncles and aunts were still eyeing Dongju greedily.

They would undoubtedly argue over the inheritance at the funeral.

There was no time to hesitate. I had to consider the possibility of my grandfather being bedridden for a long time.

Reflecting on my past life, I knew there were various ways to handle this. After all, I spent years as the secret keeper for the Jeil Group, witnessing how the wealthy protected their assets.

But executing those plans was challenging with this young body. Legally, I was still a minor.

“Driver Kim, please take me to Pyeongchang-dong.”

I had to ensure no pesky flies got in the way.
