‘말도 안 돼.’

Producer Maria's face was filled with disbelief.

It was like finding the wrong notes in a grand symphony that could be called an epic. No matter how proficient someone is in music, how could they instantly find the flaws created by an orchestra?

Considering the number of orchestra members who performed the symphony and the corresponding number of orchestral and percussion instruments, it was nearly impossible.

In fact, even when the Russian violinist Anna found two mistakes, everyone was amazed. It seemed impossible for human hearing to detect such flaws.

But Maestro Eden Simeon's expression remained unchanged. It was as if he was certain that Kang Hyun would get everything right.

‘No way.’

Maria's gaze slowly turned to Kang Hyun. He maintained a relaxed attitude, looking down at the stage from a seat in the audience.

Not only Maria, but also the Queen Elisabeth Competition participants, had their eyes filled with curiosity and suspicion. Hadn't they heard Kang Hyun's reputation to the point of getting sick of it?

Among them, there were certainly unbelievable stories. For example, the story that Kang Hyun performed perfectly with a broken harp or that he awakened the Stradivarius 'Fiore', which hadn't produced beautiful melodies for a long time.

But most of them thought these were exaggerated stories. They believed these were fabrications created by people who liked to inflate rumors.

In the midst of the curious and questioning gazes, Kang Hyun slowly began to speak.

“In the prelude of the first movement, the tip of the stick used by the member playing the bass drum wavered. The tip of the hand holding the stick slightly relaxed. It's hard to say it was simply a mistake; it seemed more like an intentional instruction from the maestro.”

What?

“Also, when the horn was played gestopft, the member's hand did not completely cover the valve. Because of that, instead of a sharp metallic tone, a soft tone briefly emerged. It seemed like they intentionally left it about one-third open while hand-stopping.”

The errors flowed out of Kang Hyun's mouth without hesitation.

Not only Producer Maria, but also the eyes of the novice violinists were filled with increasing disbelief.

How could this be possible? But it didn't end there.

“The mistakes in the second and third movements were already found by violinist Anna. Lastly, in the highlight of the fourth movement, the maestro's conducting direction was wrong. However, the members did not waver and played correctly, as if it had been pre-arranged.”

As Kang Hyun continued to speak, the murmuring in the hall grew louder. Some looked at him with disbelief, while others glanced at the broadcasting station staff as if wondering if this was a hidden camera prank.

But Maria was just as bewildered. It was natural. To an outsider, it might seem like Kang Hyun was just saying whatever he wanted.

However, everyone held their breath at Maestro Eden Simeon's following words.

“He is indeed correct.”

Maria's eyes widened with astonishment. The same was true for the other novice violinists. The new members of the Belgian Symphony Orchestra had no different reaction. Who would have thought someone could solve all of the maestro's riddles?

At that moment, Producer Maria couldn't contain her curiosity and raised her hand.

“Maestro, may I ask a question if it's not too much trouble?”

“Of course.”

“You just said he was correct. Does that mean Mr. Hyun found all the mistakes in the symphony?”

Eden Simeon nodded with a faint smile. Everyone was left speechless with shock.

“If it's okay with you, Hyun, could you find and correct the mistakes in the score? It seems the other violinists are curious about the trick.”

At Eden Simeon's request, Kang Hyun finally stood up. His face showed no signs of arrogance or pride. Instead, he seemed to dislike the excessive attention.

As Kang Hyun walked up to the stage, the novice violinists followed him with eyes full of reverence. As always, the cameraman zoomed in to capture the scene.

“Is this even possible?”

In Chappelle, the mansion called the Dawn of Melody, the novice violinists had gathered.

Although the final stage was not far off, they stopped practicing for the day to have a conversation.

The twin brothers, Bill and Max, who came up from the United States, raised their voices as if they had witnessed a miracle.

“I thought all the rumors about violinist Hyun were exaggerated lies.”

“Me too. He is famous enough to have conquered the Billboard charts in the U.S., but I thought there might be some lobbying behind it. Moreover, I heard that European maestros were eager to take him as a disciple. Now I fully understand their feelings. If I had witnessed such a scene firsthand, I wouldn't be able to resist wanting him as well.”

The twin brothers, who usually looked down on Asian classical music, had become ardent fans of Kang Hyun. Ethan from Northern Europe also nodded, agreeing with the brothers.

“My brother participated in the Queen Elisabeth Competition seven years ago. He stayed at Chappelle with violinist Hyun back then. My brother was very proud, but he acknowledged violinist Hyun. He said that seven years ago, there wasn't a single violinist at Chappelle who could match him. Reflecting on what happened at Bozar Hall today, I understand why my proud brother conceded so easily.”

Anna, who was listening to the conversation, couldn't hide her surprise at the unexpected information. She never imagined that Ethan, who was thin and taciturn, was the younger brother of Eric from seven years ago.

Eric from Northern Europe was a giant who looked like a descendant of the Vikings. She still vividly remembered how he played the violin delicately with his huge hands.

“I was really surprised when Mr. Hyun corrected the mistakes in the score with a red pen. At first, I thought it was a hidden camera prank to surprise us, but when Maestro Simeon played the symphony again with the members and the mistakes were exactly as he said, I got goosebumps.”

The main topic of conversation was Kang Hyun.

The participants were also renowned newcomers in their own countries, but the talent Kang Hyun showed was close to a miracle.

They all felt a huge barrier in front of an extraordinary talent, although they had been called prodigies.

At that moment, Hotaru from Japan, with flushed cheeks and eyes full of admiration, spoke up.

“Do you think Mr. Kang Hyun might be the god of music mentioned in the legend of Chappelle?”

According to an old legend passed down among violinists, Chappelle is a sanctuary where the god of music exists along with endless melodies.

At first, they believed it was nonsense, but as soon as they arrived at Chappelle, everyone felt a mysterious allure.

It really seemed like the god of music might exist in this sanctuary called Chappelle. No one refuted Hotaru's words. That was how shocking Kang Hyun's performance was.

Producer Maria couldn't control her racing heart. Was it because of the caffeine-filled coffee she drank? Although she had been sitting in the editing room for hours, her eyes were more vibrant than ever.

“Wow—!”

Maria couldn't help but exclaim. She had already replayed the scene countless times.

The part where Kang Hyun effortlessly solved the unprecedented riddle posed by Maestro Eden Simeon at Bozar Hall.

She had never seen such a scene in her producer career. Even the veteran cameraman was so surprised that the footage slightly shook when Kang Hyun solved all the riddles.

“The ratings are going to be a hit.”

This year's Queen Elisabeth Competition was already showing a national event or more.

The documentary covering the Queen Elisabeth schedule was sold not only in Belgium but also in Europe and Asia simultaneously.

Moreover, the ratings were quite high from the first broadcast. The head of the current affairs and culture department had been shouting with joy since morning, so it was impossible not to know.

If this scene aired, it would undoubtedly cause a global sensation.

“The next interview video will be a hit too.”

It was right after the miraculous scene at Bozar Hall was filmed. Riding the momentum, Maria even attempted an interview with Kang Hyun. She thought it would yield good footage.

Her prediction was accurate. She heard an unexpected answer from Kang Hyun.

-If you ask me the trick to solving Maestro Eden Simeon's riddles, I can't really give you an answer. It's not like I practice this regularly, and I can't possibly ask the proud members of an orchestra to intentionally play wrong notes. I can only say that I have a good intuition.

In the video, Kang Hyun's face showed no arrogance or pride. It really meant that he naturally noticed the mistakes as soon as he heard the symphony.

Maria then realized why so many European maestros wanted Kang Hyun. The rumors of him being the reincarnation of Mozart seemed more believable now.

Of course, the interview didn't end there.

-The real stage of Queen Elisabeth is just around the corner. It's very difficult for me, as a judge, to predict the winner. Watching the applicants' attitude while discussing collaboration with Maestro Eden Simeon, I realized they all understand their abilities well. It will undoubtedly be a great performance. If you ask me how I would rank if I were a participant, I would have to say no comment.

Most of the Queen Elisabeth Competition participants were older than Kang Hyun.

The question of what would happen if Kang Hyun participated as a contestant instead of a judge was already circulating. Maria dared to predict that the results would be no different from seven years ago.

-A future dream...

Kang Hyun, who was already building a reputation and achievements as a violinist and conductor, was receiving enthusiastic love calls from the London Symphony, which was a well-known fact.

People were curious about his future, his ideal vision. Would he become a legendary maestro who leaves a mark in classical history? Or a virtuoso loved by the god of music?

Several answers were expected, but the response that followed was unexpected.

-To lead a happy life.

A happy life?

-I've already had regrets once. I won't make the same mistake this time.

What did he mean? But Kang Hyun's face looked more relieved than ever after giving that answer. Producer Maria added,

Hyun, does that mean you want to start a family?
