"Old man, did you have fun in England?"

The voice was full of gruffness.

"Of course, it was fun. Imagine being invited by the British royal family. It's all thanks to my grandson. Are you curious about what happened there?"

At Chairman Yoo's words, Chairman Wang's eyes sparkled. At such times, he didn't look like the head of a conglomerate who had been through ups and downs, but rather like a child with a pure heart.

Chairman Yoo sipped his tea and looked at Chairman Wang intently.

"Let me see, where should I begin."

"Tell me everything from the start."

"Alright. I think it's best to start with the story of the Geumwang Group."

Chairman Wang looked puzzled. How could the name of Geumwang, one of the big companies in China, come up when it was about an invitation from the British royal family?

However, as Chairman Yoo continued, Chairman Wang's eyes sparkled and he leaned forward.

"So, Hyun became friends with the eldest son of the Geumwang Group in England?"

"They bonded over their knowledge and experiences in music. At first, I just thought he was a polite friend. I never imagined he was the eldest son of the Geumwang Group."

"Wow."

Geumwang Group was not just any company; it was a leading corporation in China. Rumors said it had close ties with the Chinese government.

In China, where relationships are crucial, building a connection with the eldest son of the Geumwang Group was a game-changer. And that wasn't the end of it.

"I also met Chairman Barbara in person."

"Chairman Barbara?"

"She flew directly from the United States in her private jet to congratulate Hyun on his conducting. We all had a meal together."

I've heard that Chairman Barbara recognized Kang Hyun as a friend, but I didn't know it was to this extent. She was known for her clear-cut relationships as a Jewish person.

Moreover, the fact that Chairman Barbara, who lived a life where the expression 'time is money' wasn't out of place, came in person carried a lot of meaning. And that wasn't the end of it either.

"The most memorable event would be the dinner with Queen Elizabeth II."

"With the Queen herself?"

"The Crown Prince, who attended the three-generation meeting before, was also there. Honestly, I never expected the Queen herself to show up. You and I both know how picky VIPs can be. But when I saw her in person, it was clear she was very fond of Hyun. She kept subtly suggesting that we send him to study in England, which gave me quite a headache. In the midst of that, Hyun gave her a prepared hoe as a gift."

Chairman Yoo chuckled softly. A hoe, as a gift, seemed entirely out of place for the royal family. But the Queen, upon receiving the hoe, expressed her gratitude with a delighted face.

Chairman Wang swallowed his admiration internally. He thought Kang Hyun had simply gone to England for some matters, but when did he become acquainted with so many people? Just like a talent for attracting gold, he seemed to have a natural talent for making connections.

Chairman Wang, still holding Chairman Yoo's hand, smiled.

"In-law, why don't you stay for dinner tonight? I'll treat you generously."

At the edge of autumn in 1997,

The shortened pants of the school uniform were clearly noticeable. Who knew the protruding ankle bone would be so welcome?

Just like in my past life, it seemed the growth plates were slowly opening around this time. At this rate, I might soon occupy the backmost seat in the classroom.

"Uncle, it's been a while."

Driver Kim greeted me with a pleased face. Though I was a high school student, I hadn't been able to attend school for a long time.

The view outside the car window already displayed the deep hues of fallen leaves, signaling the arrival of full autumn.

"What?"

As the saying goes, "The day you go is the market day," the students, who usually held assemblies in the auditorium, were lined up neatly in the playground.

Meanwhile, the sight of a luxury sedan suddenly appearing caught the attention of the students. If I had known this, I would have gotten off in front of the school gate.

As I got out of the back seat, drawing the attention of both students and teachers.

"It's Kang Hyun!"

Wow―!

With someone's shout, cheers erupted. It was like witnessing a guerrilla fan meeting of a popular celebrity. If it weren't for the quick response of the disciplinary teacher, I might have been swamped by the crowd.

The students' faces were visibly excited. Although the school was attended by the children of prominent companies, they were all high school students going through puberty.

Given that there were stories about me on TV almost every day, their reaction was somewhat understandable.

"Kang Hyun student―!"

It was just after I managed to escape to the principal's office. The principal, who had just finished the morning assembly, suddenly hugged me tightly.

The principal's face was filled with radiant emotion, as if he were greeting an independence fighter who had won liberation. His thick palms enveloped my hand as if to devour it.

"All our staff and students rewatched that video."

"The one where I conducted in England?"

"Yes! Every time I watched our Kang Hyun student conduct, I couldn't help but cry. The grand panorama that seemed to resonate from your soulful fingertips shook people's hearts thoroughly. I felt more patriotism and emotion from your conducting than when we hosted the '88 Olympics."

The principal continued his praise with various embellishments. His face was as elated as a full moon.

I heard that even the broadcasting stations came for various interviews. The already famous Jeil High School had gained even more prestige, so the principal couldn't have been happier.

At that moment,

"Kang Hyun student, we also received a call from the British Embassy in Korea."

What was this about? As the principal continued, I was left speechless.

The British ambassador had personally expressed a desire to convey his gratitude on behalf of England. But it wasn't hard to understand.

I should have known when the Queen actively encouraged my studying abroad.

"Kang Hyun student, do you have any upcoming conducting schedules?"

"I don't have any scheduled performances yet."

"Please let me know if you do. I really want to see you conduct in person, no matter what."

The principal had already become my ardent fan. If he hadn't hugged me again, I might have almost gotten a cheek kiss. Only after receiving infinite blessings in the principal's office could I stand up.

It hadn't been long since I felt the teachers' gazes in the faculty room, but as I walked through the school corridors, numerous eyes were on me.

When I finally arrived at my class after a long time, students from other classes were already swarming around the windows like cicadas on an old tree.

What should I do? Even though I aimed to live a quiet life of humble contentment, I had unintentionally become a famous person.

"Young master, are you really going back?"

The butler looked worriedly at Soo. Soo, who had been staying in England, had decided to return to China.

Though he was the eldest son of the Geumwang Group, he wasn't the heir. Because of this, he didn't have a good relationship with his father.

"I need to go to Beijing and talk to my father. Come to think of it, I've never really had a proper conversation with him. We always just ended up yelling at each other. I've seen and learned a lot over time. I've realized that running away from my father's grasp isn't the only solution, thanks to my friend's conversations."

The old butler with gray hair knew exactly who Soo was referring to. Kang Hyun was practically the first friend the sensitive and prickly Soo had opened up to.

Only the butler noticed the subtle changes in Soo's expressions after meeting Kang Hyun.

His eyes, once as cold as ice, now held warmth, and though he had never smiled before, he did so whenever he spoke with Kang Hyun.

"And now I need to repay my debt."

"Young master, what debt?"

"I learned a lot from Hyun. Initially, I thought it was just musical teachings, but at some point, it felt like I was redefining my values in life."

It wasn't an exaggeration. Whenever Soo conversed with Hyun, he sometimes felt as if he were talking to someone much older and wiser.

Regardless of nationality or age, there was much to learn from Hyun. Especially when it came to his health, Hyun offered various pieces of advice without hesitation.

"Oh, right, let's take Wang Chun along for the next trip to China."

Wang Chun was a driver with impeccable skills, too good to be left just in England. If Wang Chun heard this, he would surely let out a silent cheer.

"Dongju Chemical, huh."

Soo had met Kang Hyun's family and thought his grandfather resembled Hyun a lot. Not just in appearance, but in the depth of their eyes.

Now it was time to repay the favor. Soo of the Geumwang Group would surely escort Dongju Chemical's entry into China.

"It seems I need to take a break from the piano for a while."

Baek Junghoon licked his dry lips with regret. Kang Hyun's eyes widened at the unexpected news. Baek Junghoon explained why he couldn't play the piano.

"Hyung, why are you suddenly saying you have tenosynovitis?"

"I had symptoms for a while. After enduring it for too long, I finally went to the hospital, and they told me not to overwork it. If it gets any worse, I'll need surgery."

Tenosynovitis is almost a chronic disease for pianists. It not only affects the wrist but, if it worsens, can cause severe pain in the finger joints. Many famous pianists have had to quit playing due to this condition. Rehabilitation isn't impossible, but it requires a long time.

Pianists are hesitant about surgery for a simple reason: there's no guarantee they will regain their former condition after the procedure. At that moment,

"Hyun, I was wondering if you could teach me composition and conducting in the meantime?"

"Composition and conducting?"

"Yes, I know it's a shameless request, but I don't think I can find a teacher as good and outstanding as you. Of course, I mean occasionally when you have time. Actually, I've been interested in conducting for a long time."

At that moment, Kang Hyun almost let out an exclamation.

The Iron-blooded Maestro―!

The nickname of Baek Junghoon from his past life flashed through his mind.

When Kang Hyun first heard about the musician Baek Junghoon, he was not a pianist but a conductor.

Moreover, he had such a charismatic presence on stage that he earned the nickname 'Iron-blooded.'

It felt like the pieces of the puzzle that had been out of place were finally coming together.

"Hyung, can we do a test right now?"

Seizing the moment, Kang Hyun was curious about Baek Junghoon's skills.

Even though Kang Hyun wasn't an expert in conducting, he had already performed with numerous world-renowned orchestras. Assessing the capabilities a conductor should have wasn't a difficult task.

First, understanding the structure of the symphony, interpreting it, and then moving beyond the perspective of a performer to oversee the entire stage.

'He's incredible.'

The more Kang Hyun talked with Baek Junghoon, the more he was impressed by his deep knowledge. It was no wonder he was later called the 'Iron-blooded Maestro.'

A certain musician once said, "It's hard to judge which instrument is the most difficult to master, but a conductor must know how to handle all of them."

Baek Junghoon had already grasped the essence of the orchestra. For example, he could interpret Brahms' symphonies in his own way.

His interest in conducting was indeed genuine. It almost felt as if he had been preparing for it.

"Hyung, I think we'll have to stay here all night."

The night was already falling. But there was still so much to discuss with Baek Junghoon.

Though the night deepened, the two men continued their conversation. It was like witnessing an ideal academic dialogue.

The full moon shone through the window, illuminating the two, and time flowed like water.

In this way, Kang Hyun and Baek Junghoon would continue to find their own paths.

Through spring, summer, autumn, and winter, heading toward 1999.
