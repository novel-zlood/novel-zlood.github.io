"Hey you old geezer, did you have fun in England?"

The voice was filled with bluntness.

"Of course, it was fun. You wouldn't believe it, but I got an invitation from the British royal family. It's all thanks to my grandchild. Are you curious about what happened there?"

When Chairman Yoo said this, Chairman Wang's eyes sparkled. At such moments, he looked less like a seasoned conglomerate head and more like a child filled with wonder.

Chairman Yoo sipped his tea and gazed at Chairman Wang.

"Let me see, where should I start?"

"Tell me everything from the beginning."

"Alright. I guess it's best to start with the story of Geumwang Group."

Chairman Wang showed a puzzled expression. How could the name of Geumwang, one of China's major corporations, come up when it was about an invitation from the British royal family?

But as Chairman Yoo continued speaking, Chairman Wang leaned forward, his eyes shining with interest.

"So, Hyun became friends with the eldest son of Geumwang Group in England?"

"They bonded over their knowledge and experience in music. At first, I thought he was just a polite friend. I never imagined he was the eldest son of Geumwang Group."

"Wow."

Geumwang Group was a prominent company in China, reputed to have close ties with the Chinese government.

Having built a connection with the eldest son of Geumwang Group in China, where Guanxi (relationships) is crucial, was like winning the game. And that wasn't the end of it.

"I also met with Chairman Barbara in person."

"Chairman Barbara?"

"She flew directly from the US on a private jet to congratulate Hyun on his conducting. Our family had dinner with her."

I had heard that Chairman Barbara considered Kang Hyun a friend, but I never imagined it to this extent. She was known to be a person who clearly distinguished between relationships.

Moreover, Chairman Barbara, who lived a life where the phrase "time is money" was not an exaggeration, personally attending meant a lot. And that wasn't the end either.

"The most memorable event would be the dinner with Queen Elizabeth II."

"Directly with the Queen?"

"The Crown Prince, who attended the previous three-generation meeting, was also there. Frankly, I never expected the Queen to attend in person. You and I both know how picky VIPs can be. But when I saw her, it was clear she had taken quite a liking to Hyun. She kept subtly asking if we would consider sending him to study in England, and I was quite taken aback. Meanwhile, Hyunja gave her the prepared hoe as a gift."

Chairman Yoo let out a small laugh. A hoe, such an unfitting gift for the royal family. Yet, the Queen's face lit up with joy, showing her gratitude for the gift.

Chairman Wang was inwardly impressed. He had thought that Yoo had simply gone to England for some business, but how had he managed to captivate so many people? It was clear he had a natural talent for attracting good fortune as if he had a knack for drawing gold.

Chairman Wang smiled, holding Chairman Yoo's hand.

"In-law, why don't you stay for dinner tonight? I'll treat you generously."

At the cusp of autumn in 1997,

The shortened hem of the school uniform pants was quite noticeable. Who knew the protruding ankle bone would be so welcome?

Just like in the past life, it seemed the growth plates were slowly opening around this time. At this rate, I would soon be occupying the very last seat in the classroom.

"Uncle, it's been a while."

Mr. Kim the driver greeted me with a delighted face. Although I was a high school student, it had been quite a while since I could attend school.

Outside the car window, the leaves had already turned deep, clearly indicating that autumn was in full swing.

"Huh?"

What a coincidence, the students who always had their assemblies in the auditorium were lined up in rows on the playground.

Meanwhile, the luxurious sedan drew the attention of the students. Had I known this, I would have gotten off in front of the school gate.

As I stepped out from the back seat, receiving the stares of both students and teachers,

"It's Kang Hyun!"

Cheers erupted following someone's shout. It felt like witnessing a guerrilla fan meeting of a popular celebrity. If it weren't for the quick response of the discipline teacher, I might have been buried in the crowd.

The students' faces were visibly excited. Although the school was known for having children from prominent families, they were still high school students going through puberty.

Given the constant media coverage about me on TV, their reaction was understandable.

"Kang Hyun student!"

I had just escaped to the principal's office when the principal, who had just finished the morning assembly, came and hugged me tightly.

The principal's face was filled with more radiant emotion than ever, as if he were greeting an independence fighter who had achieved liberation. His thick palm enveloped my hand as if it would swallow it whole.

"All our staff and students re-watched the video from that day."

"Do you mean the one where I conducted in England?"

"Yes! Whenever I watch our Kang Hyun student conduct, I get so emotional. The grand panorama that seems to resonate from the fingertips filled with soul shakes a person to their core. I felt more patriotism and emotion from your conducting than when we hosted the '88 Olympics."

Praise filled with all sorts of grandiose expressions continued. The principal's face was as bright as a full moon.

I heard that broadcasting stations also came for various interviews. Given that Jeil High School, which was already famous, had gained even more prestige, the principal couldn't ask for more.

Then,

"Kang Hyun student, by the way, we also received a call from the British Embassy in Korea."

What on earth? The more the principal spoke, the more stunned I became.

The British ambassador had expressed a desire to convey his gratitude to me on behalf of England. But it wasn't incomprehensible.

In hindsight, I should have known when the Queen showed a keen interest in my studying in England.

"Kang Hyun student, do you have any upcoming conducting engagements?"

"I don't have any scheduled performances at the moment."

"If you do, please let me know. I really want to see you conduct in person, no matter what."

The principal had already become my avid fan. If it weren't for another tight hug, I might have received a cheek kiss. Only after receiving endless blessings in the principal's office could I stand up.

It hadn't been long since I received the attention of the teachers in the staff room, but walking down the class hallway, I felt numerous gazes.

Upon finally arriving at the class, students from other classes were already crowding around the windows like cicadas on a gnarled tree.

What should I do? I had intended to live a quiet life, but contrary to my wishes, I had become a celebrity.

"Young master, are you really going back?"

The butler looked at Su with a worried face. Su, who had been staying in England, had decided to return to China.

Although he was the eldest son of Geumwang Group, he had declined the successor role. Hence, his relationship with his father wasn't good.

"I need to go to Beijing and talk with my father. Come to think of it, I haven't really had a proper conversation with him. We always ended up arguing. I've learned a lot over this time, and I realized that running away from my father's grasp wasn't the solution. Talking to that friend for a long time made me realize that running away from reality isn't always the answer."

The old butler with white hair knew exactly who Su was referring to. He was practically Su's first friend who opened up his heart.

Only the butler noticed that Su's expression had subtly changed after meeting Kang Hyun.

His eyes, which had always been as cold as ice, now held warmth, and the boy who had never once smiled since childhood, couldn't stop smiling when talking to Kang Hyun.

"And now, it's time to repay the kindness."

"Kindness, young master?"

"I've learned a lot from Hyun. Initially, I only thought of it as musical guidance, but at some point, it became a time to redefine my values in life."

It wasn't an exaggeration. Talking to Kang Hyun often felt like conversing with someone much older than himself.

There was a lot to learn from Kang Hyun, regardless of nationality or age. Especially regarding his health, Kang Hyun had given him various pieces of advice.

"Oh, and let's have Wang Chun accompany us on the trip to China."

Wang Chun was a chauffeur with outstanding driving skills, and it would be a waste to leave him in England. If Wang Chun heard this, he would have silently cheered.

"Dongju Chemical, huh."

Su had met Kang Hyun's family and thought that his grandfather really resembled him. Not in appearance, but in those deep eyes.

Now it was time to repay the favor. Su from Geumwang Group was sure to escort Dongju Chemical's entry into China.

"I think I'll have to take a break from playing the piano for a while."

Baek Junghoon licked his dry lips with regret. Kang Hyun widened his eyes at the unexpected news. This was why Baek Junghoon couldn't play the piano.

"Hyung, why suddenly tendinitis?"

"I've had symptoms for a while. I endured and endured until I went to the hospital, and they told me not to overdo it. They said if it gets worse, I won't be able to avoid surgery."

Tendinitis is a common illness among pianists. It causes severe pain in the wrist and, if worsened, in the finger joints, leading many famous pianists to quit performing. Although rehabilitation isn't impossible, it requires a long time.

Pianists are hesitant about surgery for a simple reason. Even if they undergo surgery, there's no guarantee they will regain their former condition. Then,

"Hyun, so I was wondering if I could learn composition and conducting from you during this time?"

"Composition and conducting?"

"Yes, I know it's a shameless request, but I don't think I can find a teacher as good and exceptional as you. Of course, I mean to get guidance occasionally when you have time. I've actually been interested in conducting for a while."

Kang Hyun almost let out an exclamation.

"The Iron-blooded Maestro―!"

The nickname of Baek Junghoon in his past life popped into his head.

When Kang Hyun first knew Baek Junghoon as a musician, he was not a pianist but a conductor.

Moreover, he was so charismatic on stage that he earned the nickname "Iron-blooded."

It felt like the misaligned pieces of the puzzle were finally coming together.

"Hyung, then can I test you?"

They say to strike while the iron is hot, and Kang Hyun was curious about Baek Junghoon's abilities.

Of course, Kang Hyun wasn't entirely proficient in conducting, but he had already experienced performing with renowned orchestras worldwide. Assessing the capabilities of a conductor wasn't difficult.

First, he needed to understand the orchestration of the symphony, how he interpreted it, and move beyond the perspective of an instrumentalist to encompass a broader view of the entire stage.

"Impressive."

The more Kang Hyun conversed with Baek Junghoon, the more he marveled at his deep knowledge. There was a reason he was later called the "Iron-blooded Maestro."

A certain musician once said that while each instrument is incredibly difficult to master, a conductor must know how to handle all of them.

Baek Junghoon already grasped the essence of the orchestra. For instance, he could interpret Brahms' symphony in his own way.

His interest in conducting from before was true. It felt as if he had been preparing for it.

"Hyung, I think we might have to stay up all night here."

It was already getting dark. But there was still a mountain of conversations to be had with Baek Junghoon.

The night deepened, but the conversation between the two men continued. It was like witnessing an ideal academic hall.

The full moon shone through the window, illuminating the two, and time flowed like water.

In this way, Kang Hyun and Baek Junghoon would continue to find their own paths.
