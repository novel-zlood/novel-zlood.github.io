"Law studies began by considering philosophical issues historically."

It felt like I had become a law student. In the second semester, I had to take a new liberal arts course in law.

The old professor's eyes were sharp. Submitting the report was the trigger.

It had been a long time since I wrote a report related to law, and my old habits had resurfaced.

Of course, I had lived my entire life as a legal professional.

"Judging what is right or wrong is indeed a difficult issue. Law is a discipline that provides the basis for making objective judgments on such matters, and it should be based on common sense and serve as a key to solving the issues prevalent in society."

It wasn't a report that a freshman could have written. While it might sound like I'm boasting, it was an excellent report.

That was because it was a time when the internet wasn't developed. From criminal procedure law to commercial law, there wouldn't have been any undergraduate who could cite as many references as I did.

"Today, I was extremely pleased to receive your assignments. I never imagined that there would be students from other departments who study law so seriously and passionately. Especially one of the papers was so excellent that it made me, a long-time professor of law, doubt my eyes. It made me realize once again how much the knowledge of humanities students at Korean University has grown. Today, let's have the undergraduate who wrote that report present it directly."

The old professor's gaze turned to me. His eyes were filled with love, as if looking at a favorite student. Naturally, all eyes in the room turned to me.

"Oh, legal mind―!"

Kim Daewoo teased, gesturing towards me.

In my past life, I was nicknamed 'Persistent,' and in this life, I had many other nicknames.

I was often called an old man and referred to as a 'legal mind' or even 'the reincarnation of Mozart.'

These exaggerated nicknames were too much for me to mention myself.

"Hyun-ah, are you going to the second semester's MT?"

"MT?"

"Yeah, we're all going to Gyeongpodae this time. Even the professors are joining, and they seem to really want you to attend. You know, even the professors find you intimidating, so imagine how the seniors feel."

The reason professors found me intimidating was simple. It was because I was very active externally. In some ways, I appeared in the media more often than when I was preparing to be a member of the National Assembly in my past life. Moreover, I also donated a considerable amount to the school.

"Especially Professor Park praises you a lot. I heard from the seniors during a drinking session that he talks about you all the time in the 4th-year classes."

"The usually stern Professor Park?"

"Yeah, that dignified professor turns into a chatterbox when your name comes up. He calls you a language genius so often that if you weren't already famous, he would have pulled you into grad school 100%. He's famous for pulling undergraduates he likes into grad school."

He was a professor who taught German culture and language. Didn't I visit him several times with questions about advanced German?

He was knowledgeable not only about the German language but also about European lifestyles, so there was much to learn from him.

It was unfortunate that freshmen couldn't see him since he taught 4th-year major courses.

But grad school? Doesn't the thought send shivers down your spine? No wonder he brewed coffee himself and talked for a long time whenever I visited him.

"By the way, you won't miss being the top of the class this time either, will you? How can you study so hard despite being busy with other activities?"

"Daewoo, you should start studying too. In the past, grades didn't matter much, but now you need to manage your grades."

"Ahem. A man only starts his real life after the military. Since you, Hyun, will be dragged into the military as a proud Korean man anyway, you should enjoy your youth before that. You can't waste your youth just studying."

What was he talking about? I smiled faintly, and Kim Daewoo looked at me curiously. I had no choice but to shrug my shoulders and explain.

"Man, I'm exempt."

* * *

An hour might have passed. Even so, Kim Daewoo's face was evidently displeased. He probably never imagined I would be exempt from the military.

"Still, you have to undergo basic military training and serve in your field of art during your service period."

It was like reciting a Buddhist scripture to a cow. As they say, rolling in a dung heap is better than dying. No matter how bad the food might be, the air in society would taste better than military food.

It was then.

"Excuse me."

A sudden voice made me turn my head. Kim Daewoo's gaze followed suit.

Immediately, Kim Daewoo's displeased face blossomed like a flower.

"I actually followed you from earlier."

The female student's words seemed true as beads of sweat were forming on her forehead.

Seeing that, Kim Daewoo quickly took out a handkerchief from his pocket. Since when did this bear-like guy start carrying that around?

"You, you followed me?"

"No, not you, Kang Hyun!"

The female student said, handing me a letter. It was probably a fan letter.

When did it start? After appearing on media a few times, I began receiving a considerable number of fan letters.

When I took the letter, thanking her, the female student's face turned as red as a beetroot. After she left, Kim Daewoo looked at me in disbelief and shouted.

"You do everything by yourself!"

Bad news often comes suddenly. It was when I returned to the mansion in Ichon-dong after finishing my class.

Mr. Kim, the chauffeur, was already in the garage. Grandpa had come home earlier than usual.

It was strange. Grandpa usually didn't leave the company this early.

"Hyun-ah, you're just in time."

Grandpa nodded as soon as he saw me. His face, usually hiding his emotions, was filled with urgency. Something must have happened.

"Grandpa, what's wrong?"

Did something happen to Dongju? My advanced software was working rapidly.

But hadn't I already removed all obstacles in Dongju's future? My uncles were exiled, and my aunt was no more than a puppet.

"Yooha's grandpa is in big trouble."

Chairman Wang?

I couldn't understand. Didn't the influence of the Jeil Group become so great that in the future, Korea was called the First Republic?

Although they faced a financial crisis, the current Jeil Group also had immense influence. No conglomerate in Korea would dare to compete with Chairman Wang.

* * *

The grand mansion in Pyeongchang-dong was in disarray. It felt like it wasn't properly organized.

Even the secretaries and housemaids seemed at a loss. Even the usually lively golden carp in the pond were moving sluggishly.

"Chairman Wang collapsed?"

I couldn't believe it. In my past life, as an executive of the Jeil Group, hadn't I read and watched Chairman Wang's autobiography and documentaries by heart?

According to the records, Chairman Wang lived a long, healthy life without any ailments.

"Chairman, you're here."

President Son Ilseon greeted Grandpa. President Son Ilseon, who always maintained order and composure, hadn't shaved and looked like he hadn't slept for days with dark circles under his eyes.

"How is Chairman Son now?"

"He's been bedridden for three days, and he lost consciousness this morning."

"Why didn't you tell me sooner!"

Grandpa scolded him, shaking his head. He knew why President Son Ilseon kept Chairman Wang's illness a secret.

Although the real power in the Jeil Group was President Son Ilseon, the nominal head was Chairman Wang.

If it were known outside that Chairman Wang was bedridden, the stock price of the Jeil Group would plummet.

"Let's go see Chairman Son immediately!"

Grandpa's steps were unusually hurried. Many of Chairman Wang's children were already staying in the Pyeongchang-dong mansion, along with President Son Ilseon.

Even the third son, Son Hongwon, who had been reprimanded by Chairman Wang, was seated in a spot.

Grandpa barely acknowledged their greetings and headed straight to Chairman Wang's bedroom.

"Oh, Jangwon―!"

Grandpa called Chairman Wang by his real name and held his wrinkled hand.

At first, I thought it might not be true, just like when Grandpa collapsed before.

But seeing Chairman Wang lying in bed changed my mind.

His once robust physique had withered to that of an old man.

His wrinkled hands were marked with injection scars and age spots.

"What on earth happened?"

Grandpa turned his head and looked at President Son Ilseon. His eyes were filled with anger as if he was about to explode.

It was understandable since just a week ago, Grandpa and Chairman Wang were enjoying tea together in good health. President Son Ilseon lowered his head and answered.

"It's all my fault."

"Fault?"

"Hongwon caused trouble again. When Father found out, he collapsed."

The third son of the Jeil Group, Son Hongwon, was as problematic as Dongju's uncles.

He loved gambling, entertainment, and indulgence, and later became the inspiration for the tyrant characters in various conglomerate movies.

Without the backing of the Jeil Group, he would have ended up in prison long ago. Still, there were questionable points.

"In my past life, Chairman Wang didn't collapse."

No, I needed a different perspective. Not a single media outlet had announced Chairman Wang's collapse. It was safe to say they didn't know. Grandpa also learned about it through a direct call from President Son Ilseon.

If this fact were revealed to the public, it would cause quite a stir.

"I'm thinking of punishing Hongwon in place of Father."

"You, Ilseon?"

"Yes, this time I won't show leniency for blood ties. I'll send him to prison as Father would want."

There was a chilling determination in President Son Ilseon's voice. He was undoubtedly serious.

After Chairman Wang's death in my past life, wasn't the first thing President Son Ilseon did was to prune? He ruthlessly cut off anyone, even his siblings, if they weren't needed.

The media kept quiet, but the business world called it a purge.

That's why President Son Ilseon later stood at the pinnacle of the Jeil Group.

How much time had passed? Grandpa held Chairman Wang's hand for a long time before standing up.

Except for President Son Ilseon, he didn't even greet the other children.

Grandpa's face was still filled with anger and disbelief.

But the biggest event happened the very next day.

The next day.

[The giant has fallen―!]

The news of Chairman Wang's illness, which had been kept secret, began to spread rapidly through the media.
