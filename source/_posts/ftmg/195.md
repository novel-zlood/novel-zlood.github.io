“Law studies historically begin with the consideration of philosophical issues.”

I felt like I had become a law student. It was the second semester, and I had to take a new liberal arts course in law.

The elderly professor's eyes were sharp. Submitting the report was the trigger.

It had been a long time since I wrote a report related to law, and my old habits came out.

After all, hadn't I lived my entire previous life as a legal professional?

“Judging what is right and wrong is a very difficult issue. Law is a field of study that provides the basis for making objective judgments, and law, in particular, must fundamentally be based on common sense and serve as a key to solving widespread social issues.”

It was not a report that a first-year student could have written. It might sound boastful, but it was an outstanding report.

That was because, at that time, the internet was not well-developed. From criminal procedure law to commercial law, there was no undergraduate who could cite as many references as I could.

“I was incredibly pleased to receive your assignments today. I never imagined that there would be students from other departments studying law so seriously and passionately. Moreover, one of the reports was so excellent that I doubted my eyes as a long-time law professor. It made me realize anew that the knowledge of humanities students at Korea University has grown immensely. Today, we will have the student who wrote that report present it directly.”

The elderly professor's gaze turned to me. His eyes were filled with love, as if looking at a cherished student. Naturally, all eyes in the room focused on me.

“Oh, legal mind―!”

Kim Daewoo gestured mockingly at me.

In my previous life, if the nickname ‘tough guy’ followed me around, in this life, countless nicknames described me.

Being called an old man was common, and nicknames ranged from ‘legal mind’ to ‘the reincarnation of Mozart.’

It was a series of exaggerated nicknames that were hard to say even with my own mouth.

“Hyun, are you going to the semester-end MT?”

“MT?”

“Yes, this time everyone is going to Gyeongpodae. The professors are also joining, and it seemed like they would like you to attend. You know, even the professors find you difficult, so imagine how much more the seniors do.”

The reason the professors found me difficult was simple. It was because I was involved in many external activities. In some ways, I appeared in the media more often than when I was preparing to become a congressman in my previous life. Moreover, I made considerable donations to the school.

“Professor Park especially praises you a lot. I heard from the seniors during a drinking session that he talks about you constantly in the fourth-year classes.”

“That stern-looking Professor Park?”

“Yes, that dignified professor becomes as chatty as an old lady when your name comes up. He calls you a language genius so often that the seniors said if you weren't already famous, you would definitely be dragged into graduate school. That professor is known for pulling undergraduates he likes into graduate school no matter what.”

He was a professor who taught German culture and language. Hadn't I visited him several times with questions about advanced German?

He was knowledgeable not only about the German language but also about the European lifestyle, so there was a lot to learn from him.

It was unfortunate that, as a first-year student, I couldn't take classes from the professor in charge of fourth-year courses.

But a graduate student, huh. Doesn't that send chills down your spine? No wonder he brewed coffee himself and talked to me for a long time whenever I visited.

“Anyway, you won't miss being the top student in the department this time either. How can you study so hard despite being busy with other activities?”

“Daewoo, you should start studying seriously too. In the past, grades weren't that important, but from now on, you need to manage your grades.”

“Ugh. A man’s real life starts after military service. Hyun, you’ll be dragged into the military too since you’re a son of Korea. You should have fun before that. You can't waste your youth just studying.”

What nonsense is he talking about? When I smiled lightly, Kim Daewoo looked at me curiously. I shrugged my shoulders and added,

“Man, I'm exempt.”

* * *

An hour might have passed. Even then, Kim Daewoo's face clearly showed signs of displeasure. He probably had never imagined that I would be exempt from military service.

“Still, you have to take basic military training and serve in your field of expertise during the service period.”

It was like reading to a cow. After all, as they say, even rolling in a field of dung is better than the afterlife.

No matter how poor the meals are, the air in society will feel tastier than military food.

It was then.

“Excuse me.”

At the sudden voice, I turned my head. Kim Daewoo’s gaze also followed.

Soon, the displeased expression on Kim Daewoo’s face bloomed like a flower.

“I’ve actually been following you for a while.”

The female student's words seemed true as beads of sweat were forming on her forehead.

Seeing this, Kim Daewoo hurriedly pulled out a handkerchief from his pocket. It was surprising that this bear-like guy had prepared something like that.

“You, you were following me?”

“No, Kang Hyun!”

The female student handed me a letter. It was probably a fan letter.

When did it start? Since my face appeared on the media a few times, I began receiving a considerable number of fan letters.

When I thanked her and accepted the letter, her face turned as red as a beet. After she left, Kim Daewoo looked at me with a dazed expression and shouted,

“You do everything by yourself!”

Bad news comes suddenly, they say. It was when I returned to the Ichon-dong mansion after finishing class.

Driver Kim was already in the garage. Grandfather had come home earlier than usual.

It was strange. Grandfather usually didn’t leave work so early.

“Hyun, you came at the right time.”

Grandfather nodded as soon as he saw me. His face, which usually hid his emotions, was uncharacteristically urgent. Something must have happened.

“Grandfather, what’s wrong?”

Did something happen to Dongju? My well-developed software was running rapidly.

But hadn’t I already removed all the obstacles blocking Dongju’s path? My uncles were in exile, and my aunt was practically a scarecrow who couldn’t do anything.

“Yooha’s grandfather is in big trouble.”

Chairman Wang?

I couldn’t understand. In the future, wouldn’t the Daeil Group become so powerful that it was called the First Republic of Korea?

Even though they faced the IMF crisis, the current Daeil Group was still formidable. For instance, no Korean conglomerate would dare to challenge Chairman Wang.

* * *

The Pyeongchang-dong mansion was in disarray. It was as if the atmosphere was unorganized.

Not just the secretaries but also the housemaids looked visibly at a loss. Even the usually lively golden carp in the pond were moving sluggishly.

‘Chairman Wang collapsed?’

I couldn’t believe it. In my previous life, as an executive of the Daeil Group, hadn’t I read and watched Chairman Wang’s autobiography and documentaries as if I were memorizing them?

According to records, Chairman Wang lived a long life without any minor illnesses.

“Chairman, are you here?”

President Son Ilsung greeted my grandfather. President Son, who always maintained neatness and composure, hadn’t shaved and looked like he hadn’t slept for several days with dark circles under his eyes.

“How is Chairman Son?”

“He has been bedridden for three days, and this morning he lost consciousness.”

“Why are you telling me this now!”

Grandfather scolded him and shook his head. He knew why President Son Ilsung kept Chairman Wang’s condition a secret.

Although President Son Ilsung was the real power behind the Daeil Group, the nominal representative was Chairman Wang.

If the fact that Chairman Wang was bedridden were to be known even slightly outside, the stock price of the Daeil Group would plummet.

“Let’s go see Chairman Son immediately!”

Grandfather’s steps were unusually hurried. In the Pyeongchang-dong mansion, not only President Son Ilsung but also Chairman Wang’s children were already present.

Even the third son, Son Hongwon, who had been scolded by Chairman Wang, was sitting there.

Grandfather barely acknowledged their greetings and headed to Chairman Wang’s bedroom.

“Oh, Jangwon―!”

Grandfather called Chairman Wang by his real name and held his wrinkled hand.

At first, I thought it might not be true just like when grandfather collapsed.

But seeing Chairman Wang lying in bed changed my mind.

His usually robust body had withered to the point that he looked like an old man.

His wrinkled hands had injection marks and more age spots.

“What on earth happened?”

Grandfather turned to look at President Son Ilsung. His eyes were filled with rage as if they would burst into flames.

After all, just a week ago, hadn’t Chairman Wang and grandfather been in good health, enjoying tea together? President Son Ilsung bowed his head and replied,

“It’s all my fault.”

“Your fault?”

“Hongwon caused trouble again. Father collapsed when he found out.”

The third son of the Daeil Group, Son Hongwon, was as problematic as my uncles from Dongju.

He loved gambling and entertainment and sought pleasure, becoming a motif for tyrannical characters in various future conglomerate movies.

If it weren’t for the backing of the Daeil Group, he would have ended his life in prison long ago. But there were still unclear points.

‘Chairman Wang didn’t collapse in my previous life.’

No, I needed to look at it from a different angle. Even in the current media, there wasn’t a single place reporting Chairman Wang’s collapse. It would be safe to assume they didn’t know. Grandfather also found out because President Son Ilsung contacted him directly.

If this fact were to be known outside, there would be significant repercussions.

“I plan to punish Hongwon on behalf of my father.”

“You, Ilsung?”

“Yes, this time I won’t overlook it just because he’s family. I plan to send him to prison. Father would want that too.”

There was a chilling coldness in President Son Ilsung’s voice. It was undoubtedly sincere.

In my previous life, after Chairman Wang’s death, the first thing President Son Ilsung did was prune the branches. He ruthlessly cut off unnecessary people, even if they were his siblings.

Although the media kept quiet, it was so drastic that the business world called it a purge. That’s how Son Ilsung rose to the pinnacle of the Daeil Group.

How much time had passed? Grandfather held Chairman Wang’s hand for a long time before standing up.

He didn’t even greet Chairman Wang’s other children except for President Son Ilsung.

Grandfather’s face was still filled with anger and disbelief.

But the biggest event happened the very next day.

The next day.

[A giant has fallen―!]

The news of Chairman Wang’s bedridden condition, which had been kept secret, started spreading rapidly through the media.
