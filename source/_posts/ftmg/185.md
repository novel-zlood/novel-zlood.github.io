“Investment genius?”

How should I explain this? There really aren’t any suitable words.

“Secretary Kim, is the document I’m looking at true?”

“Yes, Chairman.”

“An Austrian pharmaceutical company!”

Chairman Wang couldn't hide his admiration. Kang Hyun, who had been extending his branches only in the IT industry, had invested in an Austrian pharmaceutical company. It was as if he was as elusive as Hong Gil-dong.

Moreover, when looking into the details, it was even more astonishing. Not only had he invested a significant portion of the development costs for a new anticancer virus drug, but he also held quite a substantial share.

“Among domestic investment companies, besides VH Company, is there any other that invested in Calvin?”

“None that I know of. Initially, Calvin in Austria was not an attractive investment target. Moreover, the domestic stock market's interest in pharmaceuticals and bioscience is still significantly low.”

Understandable, as it hasn’t been long since the foreign exchange crisis. Currently, South Korea’s stock market flow and boom are led by the semiconductor and IT industries.

In comparison, the pharmaceutical and bio sectors have little momentum in the stock market and show a passive stance on R&D investment, making them not very attractive to investors. Indeed.

“Should we call it foresight?”

It was like watching a Go master on a board. One couldn't even fathom how many moves ahead he was seeing.

He was a child who had grasped the precursors of the foreign exchange crisis even before it began.

He had not only understood China’s allowance of foreign capital but also swiftly realized the collapse of Daehan Steel.

He seemed to read the world’s trends more clearly than most economics doctors.

“Chairman, and as you mentioned before, Dongshin Group is also making moves.”

“To contact Hyun?”

“Yes, according to what is known, Kim Hyein, the eldest daughter of Dongshin Group, has returned to Korea. It seems Chairman Kim Seongrak will attempt to connect Kang Hyun with his daughter by any means.”

That sly guy, who does he think he is.

Chairman Wang snorted. But Kim Seongrak had no other choice.

Anyone in business would be tempted by Kang Hyun.

If they had even a bit of foresight, they would do anything to make Kang Hyun theirs.

Moreover, Kim Seongrak of Dongshin Group was famous for using any means necessary to achieve his goals. Could young Kang Hyun really handle him?

“Chairman, should we take any measures?”

“Secretary Kim, there’s no need.”

“Pardon?”

But Chairman Wang knew Kang Hyun very well.

That kid was a tiger in a fox's disguise.

“Let’s watch from a distance.”

Shaking off the water from my hair, I picked up my school bag after a long time. Today was the day to go to school after a long while.

Why during summer vacation? Because Professor Jung from the law department had summoned me. He had shown significant interest in me since I took his liberal arts course.

“Let’s interpret the legal principles of precedents together.”

He might even think of me as a graduate student in law.

But since it’s beneficial to take Professor Jung’s course in the second semester as well, I didn’t mind taking a day to meet him.

When I arrived at Korea University’s law school in my car, Professor Jung was already waiting for me with open arms.

“Kang Hyun student―!”

Anyone would think I had been studying law under Professor Jung for a long time.

His office, fitting his image, was lined with various old law books.

It almost resembled a Supreme Court storage room, with well-thumbed legal codes and neatly stacked copies of various precedents by year.

“I called you because I wanted to hear your thoughts on this precedent.”

“My thoughts?”

“Yes, I wanted to hear the thoughts of a lively young person with deep legal insights rather than those of an old stick-in-the-mud like myself.”

Professor Jung was not as rigid as other legal professionals.

Why else would hierarchical culture and preferential treatment in the judicial training institute have emerged? They were born out of a sense of elitism.

Legal professionals also disliked evaluations of unjust sentencing for similar reasons.

“This is…”

As soon as I saw the precedent, my eyes lit up. It wasn’t something I didn’t know. It was one of the precedents I had seen during my life as an assistant prosecutor.

As I licked my dry lips, Professor Jung approached, his eyes shining as if he knew this would happen.

How much time had passed? It seemed like I had spent half a day with Professor Jung. We had a passionate legal discussion about the precedent.

Professor Jung slyly recommended that I transfer to the law department again. Seeing my legal interpretation of the precedent, he couldn’t help but suggest it. That might have been his initial purpose.

Nevertheless, after such an intense discussion in a long time, I was exhausted. Just as I was about to leave for home and arrived at the parking lot.

“Excuse me?”

A woman with sunglasses approached me. Wearing a mini-skirt that showed off her figure and with hair dyed yellow, she looked quite provocative.

“Hello. I’ve heard a lot of rumors about you, Kang Hyun, and I’ve been curious. I wanted to meet you. My father has been very insistent.”

“And you are?”

“Oh, I am Kim Hyein.”

I was astonished at the face of the woman who took off her sunglasses.

“Dongshin Group?”

“Oh my, you know well?”

How could I not know? In my previous life, Kim Hyein was a suspect in a case I handled.

Perhaps due to her time abroad, she was quite aggressive. If my memory serves me right, she had severe delusional jealousy and even hired someone to assault her husband.

I remembered her sitting confidently in front of me at the Western District Prosecutors' Office. She was arrogant, relying solely on Dongshin Group’s backing.

But as Dongshin Group collapsed, Kim Hyein inevitably ended up behind bars.

“So, can we talk for a bit?” she said, eyeing my car.

Until now, only Yooha had sat in the seat next to me, apart from my parents.

“That’s not possible.”

“What?”

As Kim Hyein stared at me in disbelief, I got into the car.

She still looked confused, as if she couldn’t understand how someone could reject a sexy woman like her.

But I knew well that her eyes were those of a man-eater. I muttered quietly as I pressed the accelerator.

“My mom told me not to give rides to strangers.”

Kim Sang-guk was overwhelmed by the flood of calls from the morning.

Moreover, it was an international call. The German of Austria, with its emphasized r sounds, differed as much as dialects in Korea, making it hard to understand if he hadn't majored in German.

“So, the president of Calvin Pharmaceuticals wants to meet our representative personally?”

Understandably, Calvin was curious as well.

They were on the brink of collapse without funding for R&D. It was none other than VH Company’s Kang Hyun who had thrown them a lifeline.

“First, I am curious about the exact results of the new drug development. Although we received the paperwork, we want to hear directly from the researchers. There is a significant difference between theory and practice.”

As the saying goes, an empty can makes the most noise. Calvin Pharmaceuticals could not completely rule out such cases.

Moreover, in new drug development, even a single mistake could lead to failure.

-Currently, the new drug development in Austria has achieved progressive results. It has passed the third test, and the clinical trials Phase I/II have also been successfully completed.

The voice of the head of the research and development team was full of confidence. And rightly so, as the value of Calvin Pharmaceuticals had soared in Austria due to the new anticancer virus drug development. It was the same in the international stock market.

-Thanks to your significant investment in Calvin Pharmaceuticals, we have achieved such visible results. As stipulated in the investment contract, you will own a certain share in both our company and the new drug. Hence, our president wishes to meet the representative of VH Company. We will arrange the flight and accommodation.

Kim Sang-guk’s Adam's apple bobbed. It was like winning the lottery.

But it was incomparable to a mere lottery. Not only did he have shares in a pharmaceutical company, but he also owned a stake in the new drug, which was like sitting on a gold mine.

It was natural for the president of Calvin Pharmaceuticals to want to meet Kang Hyun.

He held one of the decisive keys to the direction of the new drug.

“Hyuna, are you still getting calls from matchmakers?”

Director Im Hyera asked worriedly. It was understandable, as there were fans lined up outside the gallery.

The matchmaking by the madams was another matter. If not for declaring on a documentary that I had a girlfriend, it would have been much worse.

“Recently, the calls have decreased, but there are still unexpected annoyances.”

“Annoyances?”

Who would have thought Chairman Kim Seongrak of Dongshin Group would approach me? We had already had a power struggle at Seungjeongwon. He seemed like someone who couldn’t wait to devour me back then.

Moreover, his eldest daughter Kim Hyein seemed interested in me. Just thinking about those provocative eyes gave me goosebumps.

“By the way, I plan to attend the concert hosted by Gramophone. After I return from Austria.”

“Austria? Why all of a sudden?”

“I was invited by the Maestro.”

At the mention of Maestro, Director Im Hyera’s eyes sparkled.

Of course, the Maestro of Austria referred to Karas.

Wasn’t there a rumor that I was Karas’s secret disciple after a photo of Karas taken in front of the Ichon-dong mansion circulated?

Judging by her expression, Director Im Hyera seemed very curious.

“I’m going to receive musical guidance. Honestly, how many opportunities will I have in my lifetime to be taught by him? And I also have some business to handle there.”

“I see, I watched Maestro Karas’s conduct once in the US when I was young. I still remember it vividly. But what business do you have to handle?”

Didn’t Calvin Pharmaceuticals contact me wanting to meet? I was just as curious.

Who would have thought the company I chose based on its financial statements would develop an anticancer virus drug?

Starting with the Maestro Karas and reaching Calvin Pharmaceuticals, it seemed Austria was calling me.

At that moment.

“Can I go with you?”

Son Yooha had sneaked into the studio. She peered out from behind the door with cat-like eyes, eagerly anticipating my answer.

When Director Im Hyera immediately said no, Son Yooha nodded, understanding she was still just a high schooler. Even if she knew it in her head, her heart was filled with disappointment.

“Let’s go together.”

“What?”

“Let’s go to Austria together. Director, you don’t have to worry so much. Yooha is already grown up. She’ll be well-behaved while I’m learning music, right?”

Yooha nodded enthusiastically as if she hadn’t been disappointed at all. Director Im Hyera looked at both of us in exasperation.

Although bodyguards would accompany us, it was almost like going abroad alone together.

At that moment, Director Im Hyera added a comment.
