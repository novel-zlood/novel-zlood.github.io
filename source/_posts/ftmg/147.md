“포트리 사이쉬프(훌륭해)―!”

Dmitri exclaimed in his native language. Wasn't this a famous spot in Seoul that he had arrived at with time to spare?

The Nakwon Music Store in Seoul reminded him of the easternmost part of Germany, Dresden. The instruments filling the ceiling and floor, as if fruits on a tree, gave the illusion of being at the gateway to Dresden, a city of music and art.

“Owner, are you really selling this at this price?”

An elderly man, who could not understand English, was struggling to communicate with Dmitri using body language and Konglish.

When Dmitri calculated the price shown on the calculator in dollars, his eyes widened in disbelief.

The instruments were being sold at incredibly low prices. It was possible due to the low demand for instruments in the wake of the foreign exchange crisis.

Dmitri's attention was caught by a violin.

It was an old violin with an elegant appearance that clearly indicated it was made by a master craftsman.

When the bow and strings met, a much better melody would surely resonate.

“Owner, I'll take that one.”

However, even as Dmitri paid the full price, he felt uneasy.

The owner tuned the violin with his wrinkled hands. His deep eyes seemed like those of a father sending his child away.

The old man, with a head full of white hair, seemed to be spending the last days of his life with his instruments.

Dmitri lowered himself to meet the gaze of the hunched old man.

“Is there a song you'd like to hear?”

“Tchaikovsky.”

“Tchaikovsky―!”

Even though they couldn't communicate through words, their eyes conveyed everything. Dmitri and the old man were conversing before they knew it.

Although Tchaikovsky's pieces were all complex and required high-level skills, Dmitri, who graduated top of his class from the Tchaikovsky Music Academy, had no hesitation.

He picked up the old violin.

To play a serenade for the old man.

“A gallery and a music studio, huh.”

It was an unusual combination. But seeing the exterior of the gallery, it made sense.

It was a better building than any music studio in London.

Dmitri, carrying an old violin case in one hand, entered the gallery.

Still excited after finishing the serenade for the old man, he was greeted by a gallery staff member.

“Sir, how can I help you?”

The pronunciation was fluent in English. Although he was an unexpected visitor, they greeted Dmitri with a constant smile. It was a company with excellent service.

Dmitri, deeply moved by the hospitality he felt in the East, cleared his throat. His demeanor was so dignified that it resembled a scene from a Russian movie.

With cold eyes, he faced the staff and spoke in his practiced, broken Korean.

“I’m here to see Hyun-oppa.”

If opera is the flower of vocal music, then the symphony is the flower of instrumental music. Kang Hyun was reflecting on the New World Symphony by Dvořák.

The intense sound of the trumpet in the scherzo of the third movement was enough to make his heart race.

The lingering orchestral sound in the final movement left a deep impression.

Kang Hyun once again placed the tonearm of the turntable on the LP record.

Starting with Haydn, the father of the symphony, followed by Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner who led the Romantic era, Brahms who resisted the flow of the times, Sibelius from Finland, Tchaikovsky and Dvořák of the Czech Republic with their strong nationalistic colors, Kang Hyun was spending days and nights listening to countless symphonies.

Thud, thud, thud―!

As the intense melody and the conductor’s gestures came to mind, an unexpected guest came looking for Kang Hyun.

“Dmitri?”

“Hyun, it’s been a long time.”

“It’s really good to see you. But what brings you here without any notice?”

After hearing Dmitri's story, Kang Hyun nodded.

It was an invitation that any conductor in the world would welcome with open arms, but it wasn’t particularly appealing to Kang Hyun.

He preferred to sit in his studio and compose grand symphonies rather than conduct for the British royal family.

“Hyun, you’re probably the only one who would show such a dull expression despite having the chance to conduct for the British royal family.”

“I’m sorry. Actually, I wasn’t really feeling like going to England right now. I was planning to compose my first symphony.”

“A symphony?”

Dmitri's eyes widened in surprise.

Only then did he notice the piles of sheet music stacked like a mountain in one corner of the studio.

“Hyun, are all these sheets composed by you?”

“Yes, you can take a look if you’d like.”

“Then I won’t hesitate.”

His reaction was similar to when Baek Junghoon had visited the studio before.

As Dmitri browsed through the sheets composed by Kang Hyun, he couldn’t hide his admiration. His usually expressionless face clearly showed his emotions.

“I knew from your solo performance that you were skilled in composition, but I didn’t expect it to be to this extent. Saying you want to compose a symphony doesn’t sound like an exaggeration. Has any other musician visited this studio besides me?”

Even if an ordinary person wouldn’t know, anyone who had studied music would recognize the value of these sheets.

Dmitri intended to warn Kang Hyun if he answered that anyone could visit.

At that moment, Kang Hyun thought of someone and looked at Dmitri.

“Dmitri, do you know the pianist Baek Junghoon?”

“Of course, pianist Baek Junghoon is famous not only in Asia but also in Europe.”

“He’s the only musician who has entered this studio. And when I talked to him before, he said he looks up to you as a role model.”

Dmitri tilted his head in surprise. It made sense since he had no previous connection with Baek Junghoon.

Even Baek Junghoon had only seen Dmitri once during his time at the Paris Conservatory.

That single encounter had left such a strong impression that Baek Junghoon had talked about it endlessly. At that moment,

“Hyuna―!”

Just then, Baek Junghoon arrived at the studio. As Kang Hyun stood up, Dmitri also rose to his feet.

Baek Junghoon, upon entering the studio, looked puzzled at the unfamiliar foreigner, then widened his eyes in surprise.

Dmitri spoke first, breaking the silence for the stunned Baek Junghoon.

“Nice to meet you.”

After the clumsy greeting, Dmitri's next words were filled with respect for Baek Junghoon, who looked up to him as a role model.

“Hyuni-oppa.”

At that moment, Kang Hyun’s face turned to one of embarrassment.

Sizzle―!

The chicken soup gave off a savory aroma, showcasing its tender white flesh. While it would have been perfect with some blackberry wine, they made do with rice water as a palate cleanser.

Dmitri was already engrossed in eating the chicken soup. It seemed to suit his taste.

“It reminds me of the chicken cream soup my grandmother used to make when I was young. It’s really delicious―!”

Surely, chicken dishes are universally loved around the world.

Just then, the sound of birds chirping could be heard outside. It was a small chicken soup restaurant located in the suburbs of Seoul. It was a place I used to visit every weekend when I worked at the Western District Prosecutor's Office.

Back then, it was a small restaurant run by an elderly couple as a hobby, but now it was run by a younger middle-aged couple.

At that moment, Dmitri, after finishing the soup to the bottom of the bowl, wiped his lips with a tissue and looked at me with a serious expression.

“Hyun, are you really not going to England?”

“Dmitri, I’m sorry, but it would be better for another conductor to replace the maestro for the British royal event. I still lack the skill and experience.”

“Hyun, the decision is up to the maestro, but such opportunities don’t come easily.”

Dmitri’s face was filled with regret. He hadn’t expected me to refuse. If I were the only option, I would have undoubtedly chosen to go to England.

But there were more talented conductors heading to England at the maestro’s invitation. There was no need for me to step in.

“Hyun, are you sure you won’t reconsider?”

Dmitri asked again, unable to hide his regret.

“Dmitri, I know it’s a great opportunity.”

“Then?”

“I make music because I love it, not to become famous. Even if I don’t conduct for the British royal family, I’m still me.”

Though it sounded nice, the truth was I wanted to complete my symphony as soon as possible. My pockets were already well-lined thanks to Barbara Tannenbaum.

There was no need to chase power and greed any longer. I stood up and looked at Dmitri.

“Dmitri, would you like to take a walk for a bit?”

* * *

Night comes early in the suburbs of Seoul. It was because there were no artificial neon lights.

As fireflies flitted through the bushes, Kang Hyun took out a sheet of music from his pocket and handed it to Dmitri.

It was the first movement of the symphony he had composed. Usually, a fast movement in sonata form would come out, but the symphony composed by Kang Hyun was different.

“Interesting―!”

As expected of an orchestra leader, Dmitri stared at the sheet music as if he would be absorbed into it.

Under the moonlight, Dmitri was savoring the sheet music as if he wouldn’t miss a single note. How much time had passed?

Dmitri let out the breath he had been holding and looked up.

“What’s next?”

“It’s still unfinished.”

“I see. Composing a symphony like this would indeed take a long time. Now I understand why you didn’t choose to go to England. Staying here to complete the symphony is what you truly want to do.”

As expected of a musician. He immediately grasped Kang Hyun’s intention upon seeing the sheet music.

Originally, he had no intention of showing anyone the symphony until it was completed, but he had no choice.

Dmitri had come all the way from England to Korea to recruit him. Kang Hyun had to show him the utmost respect.

“Hyun, if you don’t mind, could I try playing the violin part of the first movement?”

“Right here?”

“Yes, I happened to get a good instrument.”

Of course, there was no reason not to. Dmitri brought the old violin case from the car. He said he bought it in Korea, and although it was unclear where he got it, it was obviously a fine instrument.

After skillfully checking the tuning, Dmitri held the violin under his chin and used a small sapling as a makeshift stand to hold the sheet music.

A beautiful melody resonated through the bushes, but Dmitri still seemed unsatisfied. At that moment,

“Dmitri, would you like me to help?”

“How?”

“Let’s really play it as it appears in the first movement. I’ll conduct, and you’ll play the violin according to my cues. It might help you understand the sheet music better.”

Dmitri’s face lit up with excitement at the intriguing suggestion. Kang Hyun took his position and looked at Dmitri.

With eyes of unknown depth, Dmitri felt as if he were standing before a maestro and tensed up.

At that moment, as if starting the prelude to a symphony, the music began, surprising Dmitri.

And he saw it. Under the soft moonlight before the complete darkness, Kang Hyun conducting.

Pouring all his heart into the symphony he had composed, as if his soul resonated from his fingertips.

When Dmitri finally met Kang Hyun’s gaze,

Dmitri realized. He hadn’t come to Korea to make an offer to Kang Hyun.

He had to bring this young maestro to England at any cost.

As the wind blew from his fingertips and the ancient trees sang together.

There was only one violin part among the many symphony parts, but it was enough reason.

Why? Because when Kang Hyun raised his hand slowly,

The wind came.
