The eyebrows of Adam Wischo, the chief editor of Gramophone, furrowed.

He couldn't understand it at all. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he knew all the active violinists. But aside from those called maestros, would there be melodies that could capture the queen’s heart?

Names of violinists considered rising stars, like Zhang Yan from China, Erik from Northern Europe, and William from England, flitted through his mind.

"Adam, I heard there’s a Stradivarius at Sotheby’s?"

The sound of a teacup being set down shook Adam from his thoughts. Adam relaxed his furrowed brows and nodded briefly.

"Yes, I actually thought the Queen would participate in this auction."

"Why?"

"The Stradivarius at Sotheby’s shares a number with the Queen’s elation, doesn’t it?"

The three great violins: Stradivarius, Guarneri, and Amati. While each is a master instrument with its own melody, the Stradivarius was undoubtedly the favorite of legendary violinists. Paganini said so. The Stradivarius is an instrument with a soul, and only those who have played it can know whether it's a devil or an angel.

Hirose’s gaze fell upon an old violin case.

"Even so, there’s no need for me to possess it. I already have a friend I’ve played with for a long time."

"Queen, honestly, I think Strads should not be displayed in museums. I dislike even more when they are kept in private vaults of wealthy individuals. This time, an Asian tycoon snatched it away again."

Adam pouted like a child. He was a violin collector and a lover of violins. He didn’t want masterpieces to be treated merely as decorations. An instrument’s true value is revealed when it produces sound.

"Don't worry, Adam. Strads eventually find their true owners."

"Hmm, I don’t understand. It’s not like instruments have legs."

At that moment, Hirose stood up and walked over to her violin case.

Gulp.

When Hirose’s Stradivarius, Elation, was revealed, Adam swallowed his breath. It was the first time he had seen it so closely. He felt an aura as if it were about to emit a melody at any moment.

"Strads have souls."

Adam couldn’t deny the Queen’s words. Time passed that felt like an eternity. Eventually, Elation was placed back in its case. Only deep regret remained in Adam’s eyes. How much time had passed?

"Whew."

Adam licked his dry lips and looked up.

"Queen, who is it?"

A complicated yet simple question. Is it the person who captivated the Queen of Strings, or the owner of the Stradivarius?

But Hirose only smiled faintly instead of answering. Her white hair hinted at her age, but when she smiled so innocently, she looked like a young girl.

"Oppa, try this."

Why is she doing this? Son Yooha was sticking close to me, almost serving me food. Son Ilsung kept glancing our way, but what could I do? Even if I tried to stop her, she kept doing it.

As expected of a chaebol’s reception, all the key figures in South Korea’s economy were present. The grandeur was so overwhelming that the government ministers who attended the wedding looked like props.

"Ilsung, what’s the situation in Tianjin?"

Tianjin, the largest port city in northern China. Son Ilsung immediately put down the spoon he was using to serve caviar.

"We are currently negotiating with the party, but it seems more time is needed. I think it might be better to expand more into India, Father."

Chairman Wang firmly put down his spoon. Son Ilsung straightened his posture. There was no need for words; the answer was clear.

‘As expected of Chairman Wang.’

His foresight was so exceptional it was almost supernatural. It was only in the 21st century that China announced its semiconductor industry as a national key industry. There are still over five years left before they actively allow foreign capital investment.

However, China would eventually handle more than half of the global semiconductor market, making it a strategic location beyond comparison in terms of tariffs and distribution competition.

It wasn’t just the cheap labor. At that moment—

"Chairman, I’m Kim Sungjin, the fourth son of Hyunseong Group!"

Today’s groom, Kim Sungjin, approached the table.

The couple, dressed in expensive hanbok, bowed deeply to Chairman Wang and the grandfather. They were so tense, it seemed as if they were attending a job interview.

But Kim Sungjin, despite his nervous appearance, had veins bulging in his neck. It was later widely known that this was a side effect of an overdose of Viagra.

At that moment, Kim Sungjin and I made eye contact. "Well, live happily from now on."

"Yes, always stay healthy, Chairman!" Oh, that guy. Sungjin, you should take care of your health.

Kim Sungjin looked puzzled at my gaze but soon turned away. Not even 40 and already impotent, huh.

Given how difficult it was to gather all these chaebols in one place, the reception was grand.

From the outside, it seemed like a modest event held at the annex of Myeongdong Cathedral, but in reality, it was attended by chefs from five-star hotels.

Of course, the courses the chefs poured their hearts into were just the appetizers of the reception.

The highlight was undoubtedly the ‘networking floor.’

Government ministers rushed to bow to Chairman Wang, like obedient students.

Of course, this was not just a metaphor. Most of them were scholarship students who were loyal to the Jeil Group while living off the country's resources.

One could say Chairman Wang was the star of the wedding. The chairman of Hyunseong Group stuck close to Chairman Wang throughout the event.

I don’t need to mention the third-generation chaebols.

Perhaps because of Son Yooha, they were hesitant to approach me easily.

It seemed Son Yooha acted like a submissive lamb only in front of me, but was quite prickly in front of others. Moreover, her background with the Jeil Group made it so no one could treat her carelessly. For me, it’s comfortable and convenient.

"Excuse me."

I turned my head at the sudden voice to see a familiar face standing there. ‘Maestro?’

I almost blurted out my thoughts at the sight of Baek Junghoon. "Oh? It’s the oppa who plays the piano well!"

In the time Son Yooha bought me by speaking up instead—

"I didn’t expect to meet you here, hyung."

I barely managed to use the word hyung. Baek Junghoon awkwardly smiled and nodded, which felt different to me. It was far from the charismatic maestro of the past.

"Did you notice my mistake earlier?"

Baek Junghoon looked at me cautiously. Son Yooha seemed oblivious.

I nodded instead of answering.

It was a perfect performance. He understood even the subtext of the musical symbols.

Yet, the long fingers dancing on the keyboard were stiffer than ever, and the piano, which once cried out beautifully, was now in agony.

The piano understood how uncomfortable Baek Junghoon felt in this place.

"You don’t like being here, do you?"

Baek Junghoon widened his eyes. He hadn’t expected me to read his mind so quickly.

"Don’t confine your music."

Maestro.

To heck with it. The current Baek Junghoon was not the iron-blooded maestro I knew. He hadn’t even bloomed yet.

But I knew. Baek Junghoon would eventually break free and spread his own distinct wings.

At that moment—

Chairman Wang was looking at me with a peculiar smile. Judging by his position, he seemed to have heard everything.

When did that old man start listening?

"What?"

Park Sunyoung unconsciously raised her voice. "You got a recommendation letter already?"

I nodded briefly while adjusting Son Yooha’s posture. Since I had corrected Park Sunyoung’s posture before, Son Yooha picked up her violin and took a stance in front of me every time it was music tutoring time.

She practiced so hard that her posture was completely fixed, like a mannequin.

"Yes. I didn’t expect such a quick response either."

"A response? From whom did you get the recommendation letter?"

Should I tell her? Would she believe it if I said I got recommendation letters from Spencer, the chief conductor of the London Symphony, and Hirose, known as the Queen of Strings? Even if she believed, she’d probably faint first.

After some contemplation, I gestured to Son Yooha, who had corrected her posture. Zing.

For a moment, Son Yooha’s eyes widened.

"Oppa, the sound really changed!"

Yeah, I corrected your posture so it would change.

"Hyun, unless they are very prominent figures, the recommendation letters won’t hold much weight."

Park Sunyoung’s eyes were filled with concern.

Musicians have strong pride, especially those considered maestros. Since they put their name on the line for a recommendation letter, they don’t even look at those with mediocre skills.

Originally, Park Sunyoung planned to seek out the elderly professor she once apprenticed under. He was also considered a legend in the Korean violin world.

"Don’t worry."

Spencer and Hirose.

They are certainly not just any prominent figures.

Each name carries tremendous value.

"Are they foreigners?"

Park Sunyoung seemed to recall our previous conversation and looked at me urgently.

"Yes."

Worry filled Park Sunyoung’s face again. Was she worried I might have bought the recommendation letters? She was overthinking. Just as I was about to reveal the truth—

"Kang Hyun?"

Chairman Wang’s secretary approached me directly.

"The Chairman wants to see you personally."

"Me?"

Not Son Yooha, but me?

I looked at the secretary with a puzzled expression.

"He has something to give you personally."

The Chairman has something to give me?

Chairman Wang was as enigmatic as a thousand-year-old turtle, making it hard to read his intentions. His intuition was unparalleled. In his autobiography, Son Ilsung described his father as an insurmountable wall.
