"Hyuna, do you know how to play the violin?"

Grandfather's eyes were filled with curiosity. He had never heard that his grandchild could play the violin.

However, Son Yooha's gaze was still fixed on Kang Hyun, as if she were insisting that her words were true.

"Hyun oppa plays better than our teacher."

She's saying I play the violin better than her teacher? I have no idea what this little lady is talking about.

Come to think of it, didn't she also say I summoned winter before? As time passed, more and more eyes were on me with curiosity.

"Grandfather, I've only learned for a few months."

It's not a lie. In the distant past, I only learned for a month or two. I gave up because I had no talent.

What's that performance at the Pyeongchang-dong mansion about? Honestly, I'm not sure if I could do it again. There's no need to embarrass myself, right?

"Oppa, you like playing the violin too!"

At that moment, Son Yooha's voice pierced my ears.

She says I like playing the violin? How does this child know my true feelings that even I don't know?

I didn't expect that day's performance to be so deeply imprinted on Son Yooha. I thought it was just a child's misunderstanding, but her tearful eyes weren't lying.

Chairman Wang's eyes held a strange curiosity. His beloved granddaughter had been desperately practicing the violin lately.

At first, he had no idea why. When he heard from her teacher that Yooha had someone she admired, famous violinists naturally came to mind.

But now he knew. He didn't expect her goal to be so close.

'Old man, what do you think?'

Chairman Wang glanced at the grandfather sitting across from him. They'd seen each other's faces for decades; they knew each other well.

'Son family, are you trying to embarrass my grandchild?'

'Oh, our granddaughter is already clinging to your grandchild.'

Somehow, it looked like Son Yooha was clinging to Kang Hyun.

Others at the table couldn't hear the conversation and were curious. Some might even be anxious, wondering if Kang Hyun was a hidden son-in-law of the Daeil Group. The close friendship between Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo was well-known even in the harsh business world.

"Hyun."

At my grandfather's low call, I looked up. His gaze was as warm as a spring breeze. How could I refuse when he looked at me like that?

He was probably thinking of my mother. On the other hand, my eldest uncle's expression was extremely uneasy. He looked like a dog needing to pee.

Well, it's obvious.

A gathering of business leaders. It's no exaggeration to say that the future of South Korea's economy is in the hands of these people.

It wasn't a music concert, so as long as I had some skill, it didn't matter. It could even be an opportunity to make a name for myself in the business world.

"I'll give it a try, Grandfather."

One song should be fine. It wasn't a competition to show off my skills. But my single word made Son Yooha's face bloom with a big smile.

I really don't understand why she's doing this to me. Son Ilsung's face also filled with curiosity.

Oh, that look of wanting talent. I'll say it again: I decline in this lifetime.

* * *

'Hooâ”€ ha!'

Park Sunyoung was barely calming herself down. She was more nervous than when she had competed in a contest. All the people sitting there were no ordinary individuals.

Son Yooha, who could be considered her student, actually did better than usual, as if she had swallowed her nerves. But she disappeared right after the performance without showing her face once.

"Ms. Park Sunyoung."

At that moment, the gray-haired manager approached Park Sunyoung. His disciplined appearance left an impression on her.

"Sorry, but could you play one more piece?"

"Pardon?"

At first, she thought she misheard. But the manager's calm eyes chased away her thoughts.

He wanted her to do this again? And not a violin but a piano accompaniment. She was so nervous about making a mistake because it wasn't her major.

"They said they would pay you the same amount you received earlier."

"What?"

Park Sunyoung raised her voice without realizing it. Honestly, the pay she already received was unimaginable for just playing two pieces. And now they were going to pay her that much again? She knew it was a different world when she first encountered the mansion in Pyeongchang-dong, but this was...

"I'll do it. I'll definitely do it!"

What did it matter if they were chaebols? She now had the confidence to play in front of ghosts. Just then, a boy wearing a bow tie slowly walked towards her.

'I want to do it right.'

Even if it was just one performance, she wanted to do it properly. Especially seeing her grandfather's eyes, she couldn't help it. They looked just like when he gazed at a photo of her mother holding a violin.

However, to perform properly, there was one thing she had to correct.

"Hello. You're the noona who just played the piano, right?"

She appeared to be a college student in her twenties. Even though she was much younger in her past life, what could she do? He couldn't address her as "you" in his teenage boy's form, especially since he was the one asking for a favor.

"Oh? Who are you?"

"My name is Kang Hyun. You'll be performing with me this time."

Park Sunyoung's brows furrowed for a moment, thinking it must be some self-important chaebol's boast.

But she quickly wiped away her uncomfortable expression. All she had to do was receive her promised pay. The amount for just one piece was hard to get even in a renowned orchestra in the country.

"Noona, before you press the first key, take a deep breath."

"What?"

Park Sunyoung, like Kang Hyejeong, had a habit of unintentionally breathing heavily when nervous.

The intensity with which she pressed the piano keys transmitted to the strings. The piano they brought was so good that it seemed to read every breath she took.

Of course, an average person wouldn't notice.

"What do you mean?"

"Noona, you made a mistake during the second concerto, right? When the melody changed."

Park Sunyoung's eyes widened. She thought no one would know. It was just a fleeting moment, but she unintentionally made a legato mistake.

No one noticed. Even Park Sunyoung herself would have brushed it off if she hadn't been so nervous and aware.

How did this kid notice?

Then, a deep gaze met Park Sunyoung's.

"Remember, swallow your breath."

In the boy's firm voice, Park Sunyoung nodded repeatedly without realizing it.

* * *

'As expected, I shouldn't have agreed.'

Park Sunyoung swallowed nervously under the gaze of numerous chaebols.

Then it happened. The boy walked to the front of the stage and bowed gracefully, drawing everyone's attention.

Beethoven's Violin Sonata Spring, 1st movement.

The piece the boy wanted to perform. Park Sunyoung had practiced it countless times. Even though it wasn't a violin, she was confident about performing a splendid duet.

But could this kid play the violin properly? He seemed polite, unlike a typical chaebol third generation.

Then the boy spoke in a deep voice, unusual for his age.

"Though my skills are lacking, please enjoy."

It was a performance for his grandfather. His grandfather cherished the violin sonata his mother had played like a sacred relic. Just like the faded photo in the frame, he must have missed his mother.

I believed that this small violin could console my grandfather's heart. I turned my head to look at Park Sunyoung sitting at the piano.

Are you ready?

It was unspoken. But as she met Kang Hyun's eyes, Park Sunyoung felt her body relax.

She had experienced this in the past too. When she first performed with her mentor who taught her music. It was a comforting feeling, like playing with someone grand and reliable as a mountain.

But why did she feel this way with a kid she just met?

The question didn't last long.

Gulp.

As Kang Hyun slowly took his stance, the violin became a part of his body, and the bow's tip began to shine as if ready to play at any moment.

It was just taking a stance, but even that was different from others.

Park Sunyoung, who had played the violin for a long time, held her breath as soon as she saw Kang Hyun's posture. Just like he had advised her.

As the room held its breath,

The violinist gently closed his eyes.

"Alright."

My heart began to race.

The small violin urged me to play it.

Whether it was fate or coincidence.

I lifted the bow.

Zing.

How did he interpret the sheet music? How could he read the sheet music and understand the composer's intention to play with such richness?

Park Sunyoung felt like she wasn't playing Beethoven's Violin Sonata engraved in her mind.

It felt like she was playing a newly arranged piece.

It was a feeling she had never experienced before, enveloping her entire body.

Zing.

Breath caught in her throat.

The piano keys echoed with the violin's magnificent melody.

Ah.

The harmony between the violin and piano was crucial in a sonata. But right now, it didn't matter. No matter where she went, the violin didn't lose its grip and led her.

Fingers danced freely as if there were no gaps between the strings.

As the bow and strings continuously met, the audience was captivated, their ears following the notes.

Zing.

The beautiful melody of the violin brought the essence of spring. The piano keys followed the violin as if bringing forth falling cherry blossoms.

A series of poignant melodies. Though the sonata carried the warmth of spring, the audience clenched their fists as if meeting a loved one they didn't want to let go. Finally,

As the bow and strings broke apart with a lingering sadness,

Ah.

The seemingly eternal springtime ceased. Even after the performance ended, the audience couldn't move. It felt like confronting an unfinished resonance because the violinist's eyes were still closed.

Park Sunyoung couldn't discern if what she was experiencing was a dream or reality. Goosebumps covered her body, and only after the performance ended did the forgotten tremor return vigorously.

At that moment,
