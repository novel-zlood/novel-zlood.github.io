"Everyone, have you been well over the past month?"

The aroma of strong black tea fills the conference room.

At the head seat is President Samuel, and in front of the long conference table, professors are lined up.

It was the tea time that is a long-standing tradition of the Royal Academy of Music, which serves as a faculty meeting. It was a place to share the significant events of the past month.

"First, let's hear from Professor Bianca."

A female professor with ash-gray hair, referred to as Bianca, began to speak.

"In our violin department, twenty undergraduates have already passed the preliminary rounds of the Queen Elizabeth Competition. Judging by their capabilities, we expect at least three of them to make it to the finals."

"Will Sabrina be absent this year as well?"

"Yes, as you know, she doesn't listen to us..."

Samuel nodded briefly as if he had expected this.

"How about you, Professor Oldman?"

"In the piano department, as you are well aware, we are diligently preparing for the Chopin Competition next year. Among the undergraduates, Redmaine, Bell, and O'Connor, known for their exceptional skills, are strong contenders. Especially O'Connor, who has already performed with numerous orchestras including the Chicago Symphony, is quite the veteran. You can expect great things."

Professor Oldman had a confident expression.

That was to be expected, as there had been no notable achievements from undergraduates in other orchestral departments, including the violin.

It was even being said that this year might be a year without any awards in the history of the Royal Academy of Music. It was at that moment.

"Let's discuss the exchange student who enrolled a week ago. Professor Bianca, have you had a chance to meet Hyun separately?"

"I'm sorry, President. I've been too busy giving lessons to the undergraduates participating in the Queen Elizabeth Competition to meet Hyun separately."

"Given that the violin undergraduates are in a period of self-study, there probably weren't any classes. I understand. Has anyone else here met Hyun separately?"

At that moment, Professor Albert, with a sharp impression, who was seated opposite Professor Bianca, raised his hand.

"Oh, Professor Albert, you have met him?"

"It happened by chance."

"What was your impression of Hyun as an undergraduate?"

Professor Albert, who was in charge of the cello, was famously strict at the Royal Academy of Music, second to none.

Moreover, he was so stern and prickly about music that he never bent his will even in front of the president.

Professor Albert furrowed his brows. Was he about to say something negative?

"The term 'undergraduate' doesn't suit him."

"Sorry? What do you mean?"

Without a moment's hesitation, Professor Albert answered President Samuel's question.

"He is already an accomplished musician."

* * *

It was like seeing a dreamlike illusion.

Brrrr.

When I woke up from the illusion at the end of the last melody, the white-haired witch was gone.

The leaves that had been dancing with their heads together calmed down, and only the sound of the valley water flowing filled the quiet forest.

I immediately turned to look at Tommy.

"Tommy?"

He too seemed unable to easily escape the lingering feeling, as if intoxicated by the euphoria.

Only when the cold wind, heavy with dew, brushed past his cheek did Tommy shake off the lingering feeling.

He rubbed his eyes and said regretfully,

"Sabrina disappeared again."

"Again?"

"She always vanishes as soon as her performance ends. The first time I saw her play, I thought I was hallucinating. Anyway, aren't you getting hungry?"

I could almost hear Tommy's stomach growling. As I followed Tommy out of the dense forest, Sabrina's melody continued to echo in my ears.

"Nothing beats an egg tart for an early breakfast!"

Tommy took a big bite of an egg tart, showing a look of complete satisfaction. If he took another bite, his freckles seemed like they might fall off.

It was early, so the dining hall was not crowded with students. As if reading my mind, Tommy added,

"Students practice early in the morning and come for brunch. Usually, there are no students in the dining hall at this time."

"Tommy, how much do you know about Sabrina?"

"Sabrina? She's an enigma. As I mentioned this morning, all I know is that she was the youngest to enter the Royal Academy of Music and has never performed in front of others. Rumor has it that she doesn't even talk to Professor Bianca, the head of the violin department."

"Does she not attend any classes?"

"No, she doesn't attend group lectures either. Since it's been eight years since she started at the Royal Academy of Music, she's probably already completed all her credits. There's no need for her to attend classes. Even so, the reason she hasn't graduated yet is probably because she doesn't want to be in the spotlight."

I was curious. After all, she was the girl who had been granted the youngest admission by the Queen of England herself.

The performance I had just witnessed in the forest was so mesmerizing that I wasn't sure if it was a dream or reality.

To exaggerate a bit, it felt like seeing a pure white deer in the chapel again. It was then.

Clatter.

A single plate was placed in front of us. A white plate with only one egg tart.

As Tommy raised his head, his eyes widened. His freckles seemed to tremble as if an earthquake had struck.

"Tommy?"

When I looked up, the first thing that caught my eye was skin whiter than pure white.

Then, beneath silver hair and eyebrows, teal eyes met mine.

Her small lips looked at me and asked bluntly,

"Who are you?"

It was Sabrina, known as the white-haired witch.

* * *

"Hey."

Tommy licked his dry lips and cautiously began.

"How long are you two going to have a staring contest...?"

Sure enough, Sabrina and Kang Hyun were glaring at each other as if trying to bore holes through one another. Naturally, they had drawn the attention of everyone in the dining hall.

Of course, there was no greater spectacle than a showdown between the stormy transfer student and the white-haired witch.

The first to raise the white flag was Sabrina.

"Get up, let's go to the practice room."

Kang Hyun nodded silently at Sabrina's suggestion. As a result, Tommy hurriedly followed, leaving his half-eaten egg tart behind.

As they passed the dining hall building and entered an empty practice room, Tommy felt his breath catch at his throat. It was as if the tension filled the practice room.

"You eavesdropped on my performance earlier, right? Now, it's your turn to play."

Did she have eyes on the back of her head? Sabrina knew that Kang Hyun and Tommy had been spying on her performance in the forest.

"Can you wait a moment? I'll get my violin."

"Alright."

Tommy sat uneasily in the empty practice room with Sabrina.

It felt as nerve-wracking as being taught by Professor Albert.

How much time had passed? Kang Hyun appeared with a violin case.

"It's a very good instrument."

Sabrina briefly commented on Kang Hyun's "Fantasia" violin, calling it a good instrument.

Tommy wanted to get up and explain how extraordinary the Stradivarius was, but it seemed the two of them had no interest in that.

At that moment,

Brrrr.

Kang Hyun took his stance fluidly and began to play the violin.

Even while tuning, the melody was so exceptional that it made one swallow hard.

After a brief tuning, the bow and strings met. At that moment, Tommy felt as if snowflakes were falling before his eyes.

It was a series of cold melodies, like appreciating a breathtakingly beautiful landscape beyond the frost.

Tommy, who had heard countless times about Kang Hyun's reputation, realized that his fame was no illusion.

The youngest winner of the Queen Elizabeth Competition and a musician who had captivated many great masters was now playing in this small practice room.

Gulp.

A cold wind whirled, and the sound of tree branches shaking off snowflakes was heard.

It felt as if walking along a frozen lake, with a sharp tension in the air.

Tommy realized that this was a performance money couldn't buy.

Even the white-haired witch was watching Kang Hyun's performance with fascinating eyes.

As if wishing this time would last forever. However, as soon as the melody that had frozen the room soared, the short performance ended.

"Is this the end?"

"It's still an unfinished piece."

"That's a shame."

Sabrina licked her lips regretfully and faced Kang Hyun directly. Her teal eyes were so mysterious that they almost didn't seem human.

"May I play next?"

Kang Hyun nodded briefly. As the Stradivarius "Fantasia" moved from Kang Hyun's hands to Sabrina's, Tommy watched the scene holding his breath.

* * *

"Professor Albert, what is happening here?"

At Professor Bianca's question, Albert immediately raised his index finger to his lips, signaling for silence.

Already, outside the practice room, numerous students and professors were gathered. They were listening to the melody seeping through the soundproof practice room.

"Sabrina and Hyun are playing together in the practice room."

"Sabrina and Hyun?"

"It's been six hours already."

Bianca was speechless. Practicing for six hours straight was not an unusual sight at the Royal Academy of Music.

However, it was different if the subject was Sabrina. Wasn't she the one who had always avoided playing in front of anyone?

"Amazing."

At that moment, Tommy was witnessing the two people's performance with eyes and ears wide open.

He knew from the murmurs outside that there were other listeners, but he was the only one hearing this performance so vividly and closely.

"Sabrina, how about we proceed with the second movement this way?"

At Kang Hyun's suggestion, Sabrina nodded briefly.

Is this how geniuses communicate? Ending their brief conversation, they were showing everything with their music.

It was a violin piece he had never heard before. However, the melody was so enchanting that Tommy couldn't close his mouth.

"The sheet music has become quite interesting."

Sabrina briefly evaluated Kang Hyun's sheet music. Kang Hyun, too, gave a slight smile in agreement.

But the two's performance showed no sign of ending.

With her silver hair flowing, Sabrina picked up the violin and handed it to Kang Hyun. It signified that the first performance of the completed sheet music should be done by Kang Hyun.

Tommy felt his hands grow clammy with sweat. His mouth was dry. It meant he had been sitting there for a long time.

But he didn't want to leave for a single moment. The foundation laid by Kang Hyun was astounding, but Sabrina's musical talent filling it in was enough to make one feel a sense of wonder.

Tommy had a premonition.

That these geniuses, who would rewrite the history of the Royal Academy of Music, were facing each other.
