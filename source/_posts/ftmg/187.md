"에덴, 마지막으로 그녈 만난 게 10년 전이었어. 그렇지?"

"예, 마에스트로."

Flower petals floated in the teacup that trembled. The eternal maestro, Gustav, had deep memories in his eyes.

Of the many maestros who led the 20th century, if one were to choose the most representative conductor, it would undoubtedly be Gustav and Karas.

It was hard to determine the superiority between the two, but critics unanimously said:

"It’s surprising that the empress, who never showed her face to the world, would open her heart like this."

If it weren't for that incident, Empress Karas would have been unquestionably considered the best.

Many musicians and audiences still remember and await her.

Even Gustav himself once said that the pinnacle of the 20th century was not himself but Empress Karas.

"I was very surprised too. I never dreamed that the empress would visit Asia. I heard she invited Hyun to her mansion."

"That's truly amazing."

Gustav exclaimed. Since her last performance at Carnegie Hall in 1983, Empress Karas had seemed to cut herself off from the world. Even Gustav had only communicated with her through phone calls, the last face-to-face meeting being 10 years ago.

"It seems Karas is interested in Hyun."

Indeed, it was Karas who unexpectedly contacted him to inquire about Kang Hyun. The withered rose suddenly reached out with such a bright voice.

"If the empress meets Hyun for the first time, I think it's understandable that she would be surprised. The first meeting with Hyun is still vivid in my mind too."

Was he not the one who solved all the riddles of Brussels? He found every mistake in the movement, not just guessing one or two.

He would probably be remembered as the first and last participant to solve the unsolved problem of decades.

"Eden, the moment I saw Hyun, I thought he resembled Karas. Not because he played the violin from a young age, but because his boundless musical talent was very much like Karas. When I first saw 15-year-old Karas as a 30-year-old, I felt immense frustration."

The story of young Karas seeking guidance from Gustav was quite famous in the classical music world.

But the teaching didn't last long. There were rumors that Gustav was jealous of her talent, but the truth was entirely different.

"She mastered everything I had to teach in conducting within less than a year. She was a genius in a different sense from Jascha Heifetz. But when I see Hyun, Jascha comes to mind when he plays the violin, and Karas when he conducts. I feel like flying to Austria right now."

It was high praise. To someone unaware, it might seem like an exaggeration.

But Eden Simeon couldn't deny it. Kang Hyun, whom he witnessed, was that extraordinary.

They both wondered what kind of cantata would resonate in Austria.

Gulp―!

A loud sound came from the throat. No wonder, since '0703' mentioned by the maestro appeared right in front of him.

Looking at the door, an inexplicable eerie feeling lingered.

Should I open it?

People's minds often work similarly. It wasn't a rebellious spirit, but he wanted to touch the doorknob for some reason.

No other door had a room number, but this door had '0703' written on it.

Like a scene from a thriller movie, his heartbeat echoed in his ears.

Just as his long fingers slowly reached for the doorknob,

"You must not open that door."

Suddenly, a hand was placed firmly on his shoulder. It was Maya, the maestro's secretary, who had appeared without notice.

"Sorry, I did it unconsciously."

"It's okay. The maestro is waiting in the dining room. I'll guide you this time so you won't get lost."

He wanted to ask about room '0703', but Maya seemed unwilling to explain. She led the way with her lips tightly shut, glancing back to make sure he didn't turn back to the door.

Sizzle sizzle.

The table was full of delicacies. White rice, various Korean side dishes, and kimchi stew with plenty of pork were the highlights.

Son Yooha looked at him proudly.

When he took a bite, the cooking was much better than he expected.

"Yooha, did you learn to cook while studying abroad?"

"I've been learning to cook since I was young. It's my hobby!"

He never imagined that the Ice Queen had this side.

With her appearance and social status, one would think she never touched water in her life.

As proof, Im Hyera's cooking was something he didn't want to remember. Once, she made ramen, but the noodles were undercooked, and the broth was like the Han River.

"Hyun is really lucky."

"Pardon?"

"The spouse you'll be with from now on is such a great cook. Yooha's cooking skills amazed our chef. He praised her, saying he wanted to take her as his apprentice."

Son Yooha's shoulders rose at the maestro's compliment.

The food was truly excellent. If he didn't know Son Yooha was the cook, he would believe it was the touch of a grandmother who had been cooking Korean food for a long time.

The maestro also seemed to enjoy the Korean food.

Having traveled for a long time, he was hungry, but this was beyond his expectations. The kimchi stew was quickly devoured.

"I'll serve the tea."

The maestro personally poured the tea. The pinkish tea flowed into the cups.

Just as they all took a sip,

"Maestro, if it's not too much trouble, may I ask you something?"

"Of course. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask."

"When I first came to the mansion, you said not to open the door of room 0703. I'm curious about the reason."

At that moment, the maestro closed his eyes.

As if pondering for a long time, his eyes opened just as the tea was cooling. Unexpected words followed.

"Because someone lives there."

* * *

Manager Kim Sang-guk swallowed nervously, recalling the executive's words.

He said that Calvin Pharmaceuticals, which developed an anti-cancer virus drug and caused a worldwide sensation, was on the verge of division.

"Management rights are an issue everywhere."

After the death of Calvin Pharmaceuticals' president, his two sons were fiercely battling for control.

This was why the executives were eager to meet Kang Hyun. The shares that could determine Calvin's future direction were effectively in Kang Hyun's hands.

"Did Hyun foresee all this?"

Manager Kim Sang-guk shook his head. Even if he were a god of investment, predicting this would be impossible.

Yet, there was a nagging doubt in a corner of his mind.

After all, Kang Hyun had consistently succeeded in seemingly impossible investments. It was as if he could foresee the future.

This situation was no different.

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say he was sitting on a pile of money.

The two factions vying for control of Calvin Pharmaceuticals would pay any price to buy Kang Hyun's shares.

It was crucial to remain calm and consider the benefits and practicality. After all, the goal of an investment company is to maximize profit.

"What will Hyun do?"

Manager Kim Sang-guk, who had seen many talents as the head of the strategic planning office, couldn't gauge Kang Hyun.

A typical investor would use this opportunity to endlessly increase their value by playing the two factions against each other.

But based on what he had seen of Kang Hyun, he didn't seem like the type to use such methods.

"Could he become the youngest chaebol?"

It wasn't an impossible notion. Even without considering Dongju, VH Company alone was growing rapidly as a leading company in Korea's chemical industry.

The company's outstanding profitability led to rumors that VH Company was an investment firm founded by a group of hidden masters.

Despite this, the man himself seemed to have no desire for wealth or fame. At times, he appeared as if he had transcended worldly affairs. Yet, wealth and honor continued to gravitate toward him, like fate.

* * *

"The executives of the pharmaceutical company said that?"

"Yes, they seemed quite desperate. They wanted our support for the eldest son. The younger one apparently has little interest in drug development."

Manager Kim Sang-guk's words were unexpected.

There was a reason the executives of Calvin Pharmaceuticals were acting as if their feet were on fire.

Indeed, management disputes are a common occurrence, regardless of the country.

"By the way, Hyun, why is this place so vast? I thought it was a palace at first."

It wasn't wrong to call it a palace, as it was once the residence of a great Austrian noble.

A room for Manager Kim Sang-guk had already been prepared by the maestro. Considering the number of empty rooms, even counting fingers and toes would be insufficient.

"By the way, Hyun, did you introduce me as your manager?"

"It would be awkward to call you a subordinate, given that I'm here to learn music."

"Ahem, that's true. So, what are you planning to do about Calvin Pharmaceuticals? They seem very eager to meet you. I'm sure the younger brother's side will contact you soon."

It was an unexpected dilemma.

Other investment firms would see this as a golden opportunity to raise their value, but not him. On the contrary, it was a burden.

He was already worried about solving Dongju's management dispute, and now he couldn't meddle in another company's affairs.

Moreover, pharmaceuticals were a field he hadn't considered in his past life.

"Tell Calvin Pharmaceuticals that unless I express a desire to meet, they should refrain from contacting me. If you speak firmly, they'll likely be too intimidated to act."

Manager Kim Sang-guk nodded as if he expected this.

Indeed, his priority was to learn music from Maestro Karas.

After Manager Kim Sang-guk returned to his room, he was lost in thought for a while.

Knock knock.

Someone was knocking. Though he permitted entry, there was no response.

He got up and opened the door, but no one was there.

Suddenly, he thought of room '0703'. Normally, he wouldn't have given it a second thought, but today was different. Before he knew it, he was already walking.

How far did he walk?

"Found it."

Perhaps because he had been there once before, he easily reached the door marked '0703'.

Seeing the door, he swallowed involuntarily.

Hadn't the maestro said something ominous? That someone lives beyond this door.

But he hadn't said who.

Normally, he wouldn't have paid any attention. He would have shaken his head and returned to his room.
