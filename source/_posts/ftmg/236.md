"The real thing is much more handsome."

Elnon couldn't take his eyes off Kang Hyun when he saw him in person.

The image of Kang Hyun that he had seen through video footage was close to a mysterious "boy." He had eyes that seemed to have come from an Eastern Atlas.

However, the real-life Hyun had a completely different feeling in a good way.

"Hyun, are you still not interested in doing a photoshoot as our cover model?"

"I'm sorry, Editor Miguel. I'm not really fond of taking pictures."

It was Miguel, the editor of Boss. His voice drew everyone's attention.

No wonder, it was rare for Miguel to take such a low posture with anyone. He always had a stiff neck wrapped in a scarf and was known for his high standards as the editor of Boss. It was only natural.

The fame and prestige that Boss held among the world's models were truly incredible.

Being famous alone didn't qualify one to grace the pages of Boss. One had to adhere to the magazine's identity of nobility and splendor.

There were even instances where they had rejected a photoshoot with Millen, a famous pop star and sex symbol of the 90s. This only made models dream of appearing in Boss even more.

"We'll accommodate you in any way possible, even if it's just one shot. I'm begging you, Hyun."

"I'll consider it. But I can't give you a definite answer right now. I'm currently working on a composition for Director Jim Filmer's project."

"Thank you so much, Hyun! Don't worry about the time. Director Jim Filmer has already bragged about you so much that it's become a hot topic in Hollywood. We'll always be waiting for you at Boss."

It was truly astonishing. Had Boss ever been this desperate for a model?

Moreover, it was for a cover shoot. Not even the top Hollywood actors or rock stars had managed to achieve that.

Seeing his real self, it would be a lie for the editor not to be intrigued. Elnon felt the same way.

The Kang Hyun he had seen on screen was nothing compared to the real thing. The camera couldn't capture his charm at all. At that moment,

"Hyun?"

Elnon saw another woman approaching Kang Hyun.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Lux. I've been assigned to perform at the charity event today, just like you."

It was Lux, a pop star who topped the US Billboard charts. She gazed at Hyun with a seductive look, one that most men wouldn't be able to resist.

But surprisingly, despite Lux's sultry gaze, known as a sex symbol on Billboard, Hyun seemed completely unfazed. However,

"Indeed."

Elnon noticed it. Though fleeting, a look of disgust had crossed Hyun's eyes.

* * *

"Why is she here?"

Hyun clicked his tongue at the sight of pop star Lux. She had approached him first to build a rapport, so he had engaged in a polite conversation, but it was very uncomfortable.

Lux seemed eager to continue talking with Hyun, but he was the first to leave. However, whenever their eyes met, she kept looking at him seductively.

"Hyun, you don't seem to like Lux?"

Elnon's question almost made Hyun respond with "Of course not."

"I just have a bad feeling about her."

In his past life, pop star Lux was a troublemaker. While she had a sexy star image when she was known as a sex symbol, within a few years, she was involved in hit-and-run drunk driving incidents. The only reason she didn't go to jail in the US was because of her powerful family. But drugs and countless affairs weren't enough, eventually...

"Still, she's currently the hottest pop star on Billboard, isn't she? Boss probably went to great lengths to recruit her. There are quite a few notable figures at this event."

As Elnon said, there were many prominent figures from New York's financial and political circles, making it hard to believe it was just a charity event.

Looking at their faces, one could tell how much effort Boss had put into this event.

"The first act is the band Obrik, currently heating up the entire US."

The charity concert began with a performance by the band Obrik. Hyun knew the band by name. However, it wasn't the type of music he liked in his past life, so he didn't listen to it often.

The next act was pop star Lux, who was the same. Hyun barely remembered any of her songs.

She was currently dominating the Billboard charts and was a globally recognized pop star, but a few years down the line, she would be entangled in drunk driving, drugs, and scandalous relationships.

There was even a saying that if Canada had Justin Bieber, the US had Lux.

Finally,

"The stage belongs to violinist Hyun."

Hyun walked onto the outdoor stage. Even though some of America's most prominent figures were in the audience, there was nothing to be nervous about.

Why would there be? He had performed for the British royal family. There were few in history who had such a glamorous stage career at a young age. Perhaps the only comparable figure would be the young Mozart who performed at Schönbrunn Palace.

Hyun gently closed his eyes.

When the violin was placed on his shoulder, it felt as if time had stopped.

The audience, already aware of Hyun's reputation, watched in breathless anticipation.

Hyun thought of someone. As Mozart, Eugène Ysaÿe, and Jascha Heifetz passed through his mind, only one person remained.

A figure who played the violin, accompanied by nature, on a vast, open outdoor stage.

One could say this person was the most suited for such a performance.

A grand and bold maestro who captivated everyone.

Zing.

The sharp resonance of the bow touching the strings sliced through the air.

Hyun's eyes remained closed. As the resonance scattered faintly, he slowly opened his eyes halfway.

The audience held their breath as Hyun smiled.

Now, he would show them. Hyun's reinterpretation of Paganini's melody.

* * *

Thump thump thump.

Elnon felt as if he had returned to his childhood.

Watching Hyun made his heart pound uncontrollably.

It reminded him of when he used to chase the stages of legendary rock stars like Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin in his youth. Even though the performance had ended, the profound resonance still enveloped his entire being.

"Wow."

Other audience members who had listened to Hyun's performance reacted similarly. If Lux's song had elevated the mood and was pleasant to listen to, Hyun's performance made everyone dream as if it were a fantasy.

Elnon fully understood why Hollywood directors wanted Hyun. Just listening to his music could paint a picture in one's mind.

"Hyun, that was an excellent performance."

As soon as Hyun stepped off the stage, Lux approached him with congratulatory words. Hyun nodded briefly and accepted her compliments.

"How much do you think the donation for the performance will be?"

"Donation?"

"Didn't you know? The charity event collects donations through the performances. Attendees donate to the artists whose performances they liked. I'm sure many will donate after watching mine."

It was unexpected news. Who would have thought they would collect donations through the performances? As Lux said, preparations were already underway to auction off the performance amounts. Boss seemed to have organized a very unique charity event.

"Hyun, how about we make a bet?"

A bet?

"If my performance raises more money than yours, you have to go on a date with me."

"Excuse me?"

"I don't usually ask for a date first, but I can't help it with you."

Damn.

Even Hyun, who wasn't interested in the entertainment industry in his past life, knew about Lux's scandals. She had been involved with every famous male actor in Hollywood. Some were even married, making it all the more scandalous.

* * *

"Should I make a donation?"

Hyun didn't accept Lux's bet. However, he didn't want his performance to raise less money than hers.

He wanted to participate in the donations himself, but the organizers had already announced that artists who performed wouldn't be allowed to donate.

Then, Miguel, the host from Boss, began speaking into the microphone on the podium.

"Let's start with the donation for the first performance by the band Obrik. The donations will be conducted in an auction format, and the highest bid will be the final donation amount. Of course, other donations are also welcome."

It seemed Boss had a good grasp of the wealthy's psychology.

The outdoor party was filled not only with financial and political figures but also with quite a few famous journalists. The events of today would undoubtedly be known throughout the US soon.

"I'll donate $300,000."

"Then I'll donate $450,000."

"$500,000."

The wealthy were throwing money around as if they were buying groceries at a local store. Since it was for pediatric cancer patients, it wasn't a bad thing. Nonetheless, the amount of money being raised right from the start was staggering.

"Next, we'll accept donations for pop star Lux's performance."

Lux looked as confident as her seductive gaze.

"$600,000."

"Sir Coyle, donating such a small amount after watching Lux's performance? I'll donate $700,000."

"Both of you, put away your wallets. Here, $950,000."

It seemed some people with a personal connection to Lux were competing to donate more money.

They were all wealthy individuals with greasy smiles, as if their faces were coated in gold. Lux's confident expression was understandable. Finally,

"This is for violinist Hyun's performance. Since it was the closing performance, it was utterly enchanting. We appreciate a lot of participation in the donation auction."

Elnon looked determined, as if he had complete faith. On the other hand, Hyun's amount couldn't fall short of Lux's in his mind. Just then,

"Hyun, your performance was truly wonderful."

A familiar voice reached Hyun's ears. He turned his head in curiosity.

Seeing the owner of the familiar voice, Hyun smiled brightly. If this person was at the party, Lux would never be able to surpass his donation amount. He was undoubtedly the wealthiest person here.

"Today, I'll make sure to uphold Hyun's reputation."

It was Barbara Tannenbaum, the chairwoman of the Barbara Group.
