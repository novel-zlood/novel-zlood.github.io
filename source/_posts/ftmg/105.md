"Ilseon-ah, are you keeping everything well-oiled?"

At Chairman Wang's question, Son Ilseon immediately stood up.

"Yes, father."

To keep the gears running smoothly, proper alignment was necessary, but lubrication was also important.

Son Ilseon's role was to ensure that numerous subsidiaries operated without a hitch.

Continuously circulating funds from Jeil Life Insurance and the foundation to keep the wells from drying up.

"During times like these, you must not let your guard down. Don't just look after our household but also observe others. For example, Daehan or Daesung Group. Do you understand what I mean?"

He wasn't telling them to help but to keep an eye on profitable companies.

Chairman Wang's steps were steady, belying his age. After all, even his putting posture was on par with professionals.

"What happened when you met the elders?"

"I distributed the bribes evenly. But I wonder if it's necessary during this emergency. Especially to the opposition side. Aren't they busy plugging their own wounds?"

Chairman Wang put down his golf club and turned his head to look at Son Ilseon.

His piercing gaze made Son Ilseon tense up immediately. Those eyes resembled a tiger's, making anyone shudder.

"The foreigners are coming in droves. Soon, they will try to devour all domestic companies. If they choke the financial sector right now, how many will remain intact in this country? I assure you, not a single one. Keep distributing the bribes as you have been. Make sure the elders don't feel neglected. Even in an emergency, politics in this country keeps churning."

Chairman Wang suddenly thought of Kang Hyun. They always played Go and exchanged questions and answers.

Initially, it was to teach him economics and broaden his perspective, but over time he naturally realized. This child had a far deeper insight than he thought. In some ways, Kang Hyun understood the current situation better than Son Ilseon in front of him.

"Father, it would have been nice if Yooha had come to Gapyeong with us today."

Chairman Wang slowly shook his head.

"It's okay. She can always be with her grandfather, but lost youth never returns."

At that moment, the golf ball flew in a parabolic arc toward the hole cup.

"Mother, let me help you―!"

Their harmonious appearance looked just like that of a mother and daughter.

Son Yooha rolled up her sleeves to help her mother prepare a late breakfast, but her eyes were unusual. Even if she had done nothing wrong, it felt like she had.

"What took you so long?"

Now, she was even questioning her. Baek Junghun stopped eating his soup and quickly reached for a glass of water. From the way he gulped it down, it seemed he had choked.

"I came early in the morning just to have a meal with oppa, but..."

Her pouting made her look incredibly cute. Now, Hyera's strange expression made sense.

"Yooha, why did you suddenly come to Korea?"

"It's spring break in the US, and why ask? Don't you want to see me?"

She puffed her cheeks and turned her head in a sulk.

Although she had grown up, her childhood demeanor hadn't disappeared. Even while eating, she kept offering me food.

Mother watched her fondly. After finishing the meal and introducing Baek Junghun to the family, Son Yooha looked at me intently.

She wanted me to introduce myself.

"Hmm, this is..."

I didn't know how to explain. I couldn't introduce myself with a company name like the third-generation chaebols I saw at banquets.

Then, Son Yooha took my arm and spoke instead.

"Hello, I am Son Yooha, Hyun oppa's eternal companion."

Eternal companion?

Before I could say anything, Baek Junghun nodded as if he had expected it and looked at me.

"Hyun, I thought you were in love with music. But I didn't know you were in such a sweet relationship. The younger brother is better than the older one."

He looked at me with a proud expression, as if looking at a grown-up younger sibling. There was no time to explain. Yooha, with her arm linked with mine, kept nodding.

After finishing his meal, Baek Junghun immediately left Icheon-dong, saying, "I have a sense of propriety; how could I intrude further?"

"Oppa, I want to go to Namsan Tower."

Of course, it's Son Yooha who flew all the way from abroad to Korea. There was no reason not to grant her wish.

Moreover, my pockets were full. Not only had Mother given me pocket money, but even Grandfather had discreetly slipped me some money.

Everyone seemed to support Yooha in unison.

"The cherry blossoms haven't bloomed yet."

Did she want to walk up to the Namsan Tower observatory because of that?

"It'll take another fifteen days for them to bloom."

"It's okay, as long as I'm with oppa."

Though her appearance was like an aloof cat, before me, she was as gentle as a puppy.

I never thought I'd climb Namsan Tower with Son Yooha, a place I hadn't visited in my past life.

We walked, enjoying the spring scent in the air instead of cherry blossoms.

"Where is it?"

"What are you looking for, Yooha?"

Before she could answer, she found something and hurried towards it.

Her destination was the place selling locks. Now I understood why she wanted to go to Namsan Tower. It was around this time that couples started attaching love locks there.

Yooha came running to me, holding a lock. It felt like participating in various love superstitions from around the world, from the Trevi Fountain to this.

"Oppa, come quickly and let's hang the lock together!"

As long as Yooha was happy, anything was fine.

"Yooha, does it taste good?"

"Yes, it's really delicious―!"

By the time we came down from Namsan Tower, it was already getting dark.

We decided to have dinner at Namdaemun Market. A place I had visited in my previous life, famous for its braised cutlassfish.

Carefully, I deboned the cutlassfish and placed the flesh on a spoon.

"Oh my. Such pretty students have come to eat. Auntie will give you each a fried egg as a service!"

The aunt, who seemed younger than I remembered, spoke in a hearty dialect as she placed perfectly fried eggs on our rice bowls.

Son Yooha politely bowed to the aunt. Although she looked like she was heading towards becoming an ice queen, her heart was the warmest.

"Oppa, I'm home tomorrow too. Can you hang out with me?"

"Is there somewhere you want to go?"

Son Yooha stopped eating and smiled at me.

"I like being anywhere as long as I'm with oppa."

"Are you saying ticket inquiries are pouring in already?"

Director Im Hyera couldn't believe her ears. Although Kang Hyun's solo recital had been decided, there was still plenty of time left.

"Ms. Mihyun, where did the inquiries come from?"

"From Japan and the UK. We also had inquiries from the US yesterday."

She knew Maestro Gustav's interview would have a significant impact, but not to this extent. It was as if they had been waiting eagerly to reach out.

Especially in Japan, they were continuously sending love calls to release Kang Hyun's classical albums.

"Writer, please take a look at this. It's an album released in Japan that features Hyun's story."

It was a highly reputable classical music magazine from Japan.

Flipping through the pages, Kang Hyun's name appeared right from the first page. The interviewee was none other than the queen of strings, Hirose.

"From the moment I first met that child, I eagerly awaited his performance. The moment the fantasy born with ecstasy fully reveals itself, the world will welcome a virtuoso."

Such high praise. It was only natural for Hirose, known as the grand dame of Japanese classical music, to draw significant attention with her generous compliments.

Im Hyera felt anew how remarkable Kang Hyun was. Just how many people had he influenced?

"Announce that the recital will be held at the Concert Hall of the Seoul Arts Center. I've already discussed this with Hyun, so it's okay to reveal this much."

The Concert Hall of the Seoul Arts Center had well over two thousand seats, far more than a few hundred. It was a number that many performers couldn't handle.

But Kang Hyun was enthusiastic about it, saying it was a place where he could freely perform his envisioned repertoire.

"There are many inquiries about the repertoire for the recital. What should we do?"

"For now, no comment."

Director Im Hyera, too, wanted to ask Kang Hyun about the repertoire for the recital. The original piece she heard in Italy had left a profound impression on her.

However, she couldn't disturb Kang Hyun at this moment. Youthful endeavors were more important than anything else.

* * *

"So, this is where oppa creates music?"

I couldn't believe it, but the place Yooha most wanted to visit was my studio. She looked around the studio with fascination.

To her, every object in the studio, from the synthesizer I sometimes used as a pillow to the instruments I used as blankets, must have seemed like a series of intriguing items.

"How many scores have you written?"

Just like Baek Junghun, Yooha was astonished by the sight of so many scores.

She, too, had learned music as part of her social education. She knew how difficult it was to compose. That's why she was amazed by the sheer number of scores.

"Oppa, I heard you're having a solo recital soon? I'm okay, so please practice freely. I don't want to affect your skills because of me."

Although there was still plenty of time before the recital, I thought it would be okay to take a break for today.

But seeing Yooha sitting on the sofa, ready to listen attentively, I couldn't just sit still. So...

"Then today, I'll perform for a single audience."

Yooha's lips curved into a smile at the mention of a single audience.

Carefully, I picked up the Guarneri violin from its case. It gleamed as if ready to cry out in melody.

As I placed the Guarneri on my shoulder, my posture naturally took shape.

"Oppa, can you play that piece for me? The one you played in Italy."

I nodded briefly. As the bow touched the strings, a refreshing breeze seemed to blow.

Cantabile, the bow gently met the strings, producing a graceful melody. It was like singing.

The fingers pressing the strings created a trill, expressing her quick steps.

Gradually, the bowing speed increased. At the moment when the bow strongly crossed the strings, representing her trembling heart.

Zing―!

The melody of "Fiore" resonated as if bursting forth.

Like a beating heart, my left hand played pizzicato while my right hand, holding the bow, produced a brilliant voice.

The notes were written with Son Yooha in mind. From the moment she first tugged at my sleeve to the days she smiled at me, they turned into musical ideas that resonated.

Time flowed like a river.

When I play, I enter a state of complete absorption. It feels like nothing around me exists.

Even though the sun had set and time had passed, the melody continued to resonate. I didn't know how many pieces I had played.

Yooha had already leaned back on the sofa and closed her eyes. The smile on her lips indicated that she was having a happy dream.

"Sleep well."

I laid Yooha down on the sofa and covered her with a blanket. Then I sat down, leaning against it.

Creak―

How much time had passed? The door to the studio opened cautiously.

"Oh my, look at these two."

Director Im Hyera couldn't help but smile. She felt like grabbing a camera to capture the moment.
