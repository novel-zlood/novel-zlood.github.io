"Hyun, have you traveled abroad a lot?"

A savory smell stimulates the taste buds.

"Why?"

The German sausage Blutwurst is similar in texture and taste to our country's blood sausage. If you generously slice the sausage into a broth made with ramen soup and minced garlic, and substitute pasta for glass noodles, you get a truly avant-garde fusion dish.

"It just seemed like you were very familiar with shopping at Aldi and cooking. I felt this way since London, but I held back my curiosity."

"Really?"

It wasn't unreasonable for Chrissy to feel that way.

Considering he was just a first-year high school student, he had quite a bit of experience abroad. Moreover, his skilled cooking abilities could be attributed to his previous life of living alone. Even after getting married, he never once received a meal from his wife, so it wasn't surprising.

"And your pronunciation too. It's like someone who has lived in England for a long time."

"I studied hard on my own in Korea."

"To think you learned such pronunciation through self-study. I have a cousin who immigrated to London as a child, but your pronunciation is better than his. Even better than someone who has lived in England for over ten years."

I waved my hand in modesty at Chrissy's compliment. It wasn't an exaggeration to say I studied English for decades if you include my past life.

Anyway, there was a lot of food. From army stew to pork knuckles mimicking Schweinshaxe, it was like a panorama of East and West spread out on the table. I felt like having a cold beer immediately.

"I'm sorry I can't cook. I never imagined you would prepare so much food alone."

"It's okay. I'm just glad we chose to stay in a regular house instead of a hotel. This way, we can invite guests over."

Just then, the doorbell rang.

"Welcome, Maestro. Concertmaster."

Maestro Yuri and Concertmaster Samuel had arrived. As soon as they opened the door, they seemed quite taken aback by the smell of food.

They probably never imagined I would prepare such a feast.

The basics of social life involve winning over your superiors. Europeans, in particular, value dinner invitations, so it must have made a big impression.

Having honed my skills dealing with Chinese people through guanxi in my past life, this was nothing.

"I should be the one inviting you, but I feel embarrassed to be invited by you."

"Maestro, it doesn't matter who invites whom. What's important is spending a warm evening together."

The saying goes, "Know your enemy and know yourself, and you will win a hundred battles." These two were perfect for understanding the personal details of the meticulous Berlin Philharmonic members. Especially Concertmaster Samuel was the most needed person. To properly experience the Berlin Philharmonic in just fifteen days.

"Did you call a hotel chef?"

"Of course not. I made it myself, for both of you."

If the Domestic Queen shined in London,

It's time for the King of Guanxi to shine here in Berlin.

"Alberto, is this how you do it?"

Kang Hyun was busy mingling with the Berlin Philharmonic members since morning. He hadn't let go of the sheet music and violin for a moment, and the reason he was so desperate was right here.

European and American orchestras have different styles. While Americans build their skills based on textbook techniques, Europeans prioritize the interpretation of the piece over technique.

Especially, world-renowned symphony orchestras tend to have their unique nuances for each repertoire.

"So, for the trill in the third movement, like this?"

"Hyun, that's it!"

First violin sub-principal Alberto gave a thumbs-up. He was better than most new members. No, he was on par with the experienced members.

Typically, new members struggle to adapt when moving from a minor symphony to a major one. The playing techniques and interpretations are so different.

It's like a child learning to walk for the first time; you have to go back to basics. It's often said that it takes at least five years to adapt to a major orchestra.

'Amazing.'

Concertmaster Samuel glanced at Hyun, who was moving among the members, conversing with them.

Usually, new members are overwhelmed and can't show their full potential. But Hyun was different.

'Is he really made for the orchestra?'

Being an outstanding soloist and being a great orchestra member are completely different matters.

Even excellent solo performers can sometimes create discord in an orchestra.

Initially, Samuel thought Hyun might be similar to them. But his expectations were beautifully shattered.

"What do you think about Tchaikovsky's piece?"

"Yes, I'm curious about your thoughts. It's the repertoire for our next concert. Especially your thoughts on Symphony No. 6."

"Tchaikovsky's 'Pathétique' is truly amazing. It's like his final agony expressed in a piece. Though 'Winter Dreams' is good, I think this piece best expresses his final shadow. The extreme contrast between pianissimo and fortissimo becomes even more pronounced in live performance. I once had the chance to hear the Moscow Philharmonic perform it in Russia."

He instantly captivated the members. Not only was his playing excellent, but his rapport with the members was also outstanding. Who could dislike that? Even those who initially opposed him were won over by his eloquence.

Concertmaster Samuel was bewildered. The members of the Berlin Philharmonic, known for their musical pride and strong personalities, were now showing favor towards Hyun.

Hyun was as adept as someone who had dealt with people for decades. In many ways.

"The second movement of 'Pathétique' has a 5/4 time signature and contains a Slavic and uneasy metaphor, but the Moscow Philharmonic was different. Instead of maintaining a fragile mirage-like unease, it exuded a warm and gentle melody. Almost like a Russian folk song."

"I'm very curious about how it felt. I heard the conductor of the Moscow Philharmonic changed. Thanks to the new associate conductor, their icy melody melted. Hyun, could you tell us more?"

"Just a moment. Could everyone help me?"

In an instant, he gathered all the instruments used in 'Pathétique' from woodwinds to strings. He even instructed on tempo, dynamics, and emotions as if recalling the musical phrases.

At that time, there were individual parts but no full score. Yet Hyun signaled to the members as if he had memorized the full score.

Even Samuel, who was watching, had to join in. After all, he had been invited to dinner, so he had to earn his keep.

"A bit warmer here!"

Before long, the melody of the Moscow Philharmonic was recreated through his fingertips.

"The more popular you are,"

They say to row while the tide is in your favor.

"Avoid excessive media exposure."

However, excessive attention can sometimes have negative effects.

Director Im Hyera was an exceptional supporter. Considering Hyun's age, she curtailed further media exposure. She was different from other agencies that treated artists as mere consumables.

"Did the reporters find out that Hyun is in Berlin?"

"Yes, I received a call from Chief Editor Choi of the East-West Daily a few days ago. He said he saw a boy resembling Hyun at Berlin Airport. He keeps contacting me, asking if there's any scoop. Of course, I replied that it was news to me."

"It's okay. I'll handle it."

Surely, with the backing of the Jeil Group's mistress, no one would dare write a bad article about Hyun.

But just in case, it was better to keep things under wraps. To avoid any articles about Hyun from appearing.

Public service ads were unavoidable due to government policy, but further national attention was unwelcome.

'No matter how I think about it, he has a broad vision.'

Director Im Hyera recalled what Hyun had said before heading to London.

Hadn't he said that if reporters knew he was doing fieldwork at the London and Berlin symphony orchestras, they would make a fuss? For example, receiving exaggerated spotlights.

He wasn't exaggerating. Even those unfamiliar with classical music would have heard of the London Symphony and Berlin Philharmonic's reputation.

-Just as a flower loves the sun, if it loves too much, it eventually withers and dies.

He had an insight that seemed beyond his seventeen years. Hyun had already realized the truth of life—too much is as bad as too little.

Director Im Hyera often wondered about Hyun's age. No matter how she looked at it, his skills in dealing with people didn't seem like those of a seventeen-year-old student.

Buzz.

He performed a self-composed piece in front of the Berlin Philharmonic members. Although he had played it in a recital, it hadn't been released as an album yet. Like Baek Jung-hoon, the members' eyes were filled with surprise.

"Hyun, what's the title of that piece?"

"It doesn't have one yet. It's just numbered."

"What?"

First violin sub-principal Alberto raised his voice. The other members were the same. They were astonished that the piece they had listened to so attentively was just numbered.

"I always feel that Hyun lacks self-awareness."

"That's right. There's never been a musician of Hyun's age who has made such a confident impression in the Berlin Philharmonic."

"You flatter me."

He had already become quite friendly with the Berlin Philharmonic members. Having won over Concertmaster Samuel with a dinner invitation and familiarizing himself with the members' personalities in advance had been quite helpful.

Moderate eloquence and social skills were basic. After all, in his past life, he had dealt with numerous people as a prosecutor and lawyer and met various types while preparing to become a member of the National Assembly, so he was adept.

At that moment.

"Hyun, Maestro wants to see you for a moment."

The Maestro suddenly called for me.

Wondering if I had done anything wrong, I pondered all the way to the conductor's waiting room but couldn't think of any missteps.

On the contrary, I had adapted to the Berlin Philharmonic better than anyone else over the past few days. In fact, I might have adapted the fastest among all the past members.

"Maestro, did you call for me?"

Maestro Yuri had something to say. With a meaningful look, he started to speak.

"Hyun, you know there's a Berlin Philharmonic concert coming up soon, right?"

"Yes, Maestro. It's a free concert for the Berlin Academy and local residents, right?"

"That's right. It's an annual concert. It's for the Academy and residents who have helped elevate the Berlin Philharmonic's reputation."

Although it was a free concert, the members' practice continued daily without a break. In a way, it seemed more important than any other concert.

That's because, even though it was free, showing subpar skills would tarnish the Berlin Philharmonic's reputation.

"Guest conductors always hope to eventually have their own orchestra. But to achieve that, they need to go through numerous experiences and symphonies. How long do you think it typically takes to become a permanent conductor of a world-renowned orchestra, known as a major one?"

"I don't know. Doesn't it vary by conductor?"

"Some take ten years, some even longer, and some never make it. Just having the skills doesn't guarantee you'll be given the baton at a world-renowned orchestra. It's often said that it's a position chosen by the god of music. But sometimes, guest conductors get opportunities. When the scheduled permanent conductor fails to manage their condition, or when the associate conductor position is vacant."

What on earth was the Maestro trying to say? As my curiosity grew, he continued.

"In the upcoming concert, would you like to conduct the second part?"

"Excuse me?"

"Of course, only if the members approve."

The Berlin Philharmonic's lion Yuri was smiling faintly, as if everything was going according to plan.
