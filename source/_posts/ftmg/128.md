“Have you traveled abroad a lot, Hyun?”

The savory smell stimulates my salivary glands.

“Why?”

The German sausage Blutwurst has a similar texture and taste to Korean blood sausage. If you generously add sliced sausages to the army stew broth made with ramen soup and minced garlic, and substitute pasta for glass noodles, you get a fusion dish ahead of its time.

“Because you seemed so familiar with shopping at Aldi and cooking. Actually, I felt it since London, but I was curious and kept it to myself.”

“Really?”

It was no wonder that Chrissy felt that way.

After all, didn't I, as a first-year high school student, experience quite a bit of foreign culture? Moreover, this proficient cooking skill could be attributed to my previous life experience living alone. Even after getting married, I was a guy who never received a meal from my wife, so it's no surprise.

“And your pronunciation too. It sounds like someone who has lived in the UK for a long time.”

“I studied hard by myself in Korea.”

“To think you could pronounce so well through self-study. I have a cousin who immigrated to London when he was young, but your pronunciation is better than his. Even better than someone who has lived in the UK for over ten years.”

I waved my hand modestly at Chrissy's compliment. After all, including my past life, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say I had studied English for decades.

Anyway, there was a lot of food. From army stew to boiled pork imitating Schweinshaxe, it was like a panorama of East and West spread out on the table. I felt like gulping down a cold beer right away.

“I'm sorry I can't cook. I never imagined you would prepare so much food by yourself, Hyun.”

“It's okay. I'm just glad we booked a regular house instead of a hotel. That way, we can invite guests.”

Just then, the doorbell rang.

“Welcome, Maestro. Concertmaster.”

It was Maestro Yuri and Concertmaster Samuel. As soon as they opened the door, they seemed quite surprised by the smell of food.

They probably didn't expect me to prepare such a feast.

The basics of social life lie in winning over superiors. Especially since Europeans value meal invitations highly, it would have made a big impression.

Having dealt with Chinese people and trained in guanxi in my previous life, this was nothing.

“I should be the one inviting, but I feel embarrassed to be invited by you, Hyun.”

“Maestro, does it matter who invites? What's more important is that we have a warm evening together.”

As the saying goes, know your enemy and know yourself, and you will win every battle. To properly grasp the personal details of the picky Berlin Phil members, these two were perfect. Especially Concertmaster Samuel was the most needed person. If I were to fully experience the Berlin Phil in a short period of two weeks.

“Did you hire a hotel chef?”

“No way, I made it myself. For you two.”

If the Queen of Domestic Affairs shone in London,

Here in Berlin, it was time for the King of Guanxi to shine.

“Alberto, is this how you do it?”

Kang Hyun was busy mingling with the Berlin Phil members since morning. He hadn't let go of the sheet music and violin for a while, and this was the reason why Kang Hyun was so desperate.

European and American orchestras have different styles. While America builds skills based on textbook techniques, Europe prioritizes the interpretation of the piece over technique.

Especially leading symphony orchestras have their unique nuances per repertoire.

“So, in this part of the third movement, the trill should be like this?”

“Hyun, exactly―!”

Alberto, the deputy first violinist, gave a thumbs up. He was better than most new members. No, he was as good as the experienced members.

Usually, when moving from a minor to a major symphony, new members have difficulty adapting. The playing techniques and interpretations are very different.

It's like going back to the basics as a child learning to walk. No wonder they say you need at least five years in a major orchestra to adapt.

‘Amazing.’

Concertmaster Samuel glanced at Kang Hyun, who was conversing with the members.

New members usually get overwhelmed and can't showcase their skills. But Kang Hyun was different.

‘Is he really suited for an orchestra?’

Being an outstanding soloist and an excellent orchestra member are entirely different matters.

Even excellent soloists sometimes create discord in an orchestra.

At first, Samuel thought Hyun might be similar to them. But his expectations were pleasantly wrong.

“What do you think of Tchaikovsky's piece?”

“Yes, I'm curious about your thoughts, Hyun. It's the repertoire for our next performance. I'd like to hear your take on the 6th Symphony.”

“Tchaikovsky's 'Pathétique' is truly remarkable. It's like his last cry in life. While 'Winter Dreams' is good, I think this piece best expresses his final shadow. The extreme contrast between pianissimo and fortissimo is even more pronounced in live performances. I once had the chance to hear the Moscow Philharmonic perform it live in Russia.”

He instantly captured the attention of the members. Not only were his performance skills excellent, but his ability to communicate with the members was also outstanding. Even those who initially opposed him were won over by his eloquence.

Concertmaster Samuel was astonished. The members of the Berlin Phil, known for their musical pride and strong personalities, were already showing a liking for Hyun.

Like someone who had dealt with people for decades, Hyun was adept. In many ways.

“The second movement of the 'Pathétique' is in 5/4 time, with a Slavic and uncertain metaphor. But the Moscow Philharmonic was different. Instead of maintaining a precarious mirage, they showcased a warm and gentle melody, like a Russian folk song.”

“I'm very curious about how it felt. The conductor of the Moscow Philharmonic has changed, hasn't he? Thanks to the new associate conductor, even their icy melodies have melted. Hyun, could you tell us more?”

“Just a moment. Could everyone help me, please?”

In an instant, he gathered all the instruments used in the 'Pathétique' from woodwinds to strings. Moreover, he ordered the tempo, dynamics, and emotions as if recalling the musical impression from that time.

The members had their individual scores, but there was no full score. Yet Hyun gave signals to the members as if he had memorized the full score.

Samuel, watching the scene, also had to join in. After all, having been invited to dinner, he had to earn his meal.

“Make it a bit warmer here―!”

Before long, the melody of the Moscow Philharmonic was being recreated at his fingertips.

“The more popular you are, the better, but,”

As the saying goes, strike while the iron is hot.

“Avoid excessive media exposure.”

But excessive attention can sometimes have adverse effects.

Director Im Hyera was an excellent supporter. Considering Hyun's age, she restrained further media exposure. Unlike other agencies that view artists as mere consumables, she was different.

“Did the reporters find out Hyun is in Berlin?”

“Yes, I received a call from Chief Editor Choi of Dongseo Ilbo a few days ago. He said he saw a boy resembling Hyun at Berlin Airport. He contacts me almost every day, asking if there are any leads. Of course, I responded that it was news to me.”

“It's okay, I'll handle it.”

Given that the wife of the chairman of Daeil Group had his back, it was unlikely anyone would dare write a bad article about Hyun.

But just in case, it was better to keep it under wraps. To ensure no articles about Hyun came out.

Public service advertisements were mandated by the government, so they were unavoidable, but she wanted to avoid further national attention.

‘No matter how you think about it, he has a wide perspective.’

Director Im Hyera recalled what Hyun had said before heading to London.

Didn't he say that if journalists knew he was doing fieldwork at the symphony orchestras in London and Berlin, they would make a fuss? He said he would receive exaggerated spotlight, for example.

He was not wrong. Even those unfamiliar with classical music would have heard of the London Symphony and the Berlin Philharmonic's fame.

- No matter how much a flower loves sunlight, if it loves it too much, it eventually withers and dies.

Didn't he have a profound insight unthinkable for a mere seventeen-year-old? Hyun had already grasped the life truth of moderation.

Director Im Hyera sometimes wondered how old Hyun really was. His way of dealing with people did not seem like that of a seventeen-year-old student.

* * *

Bzz.

He played his own composition in front of the Berlin Phil members. It had been performed at a recital but hadn't been released on an album yet. Like with Baek Jeonghoon, their eyes were full of surprise.

“Hyun, what’s the title of this piece?”

“It doesn’t have one yet; it’s just numbered.”

“What?”

Alberto, the deputy first violinist, raised his voice. The other members were the same. They were dumbfounded that the music that had impressed them was only numbered.

“I always feel that Hyun has no self-awareness.”

“Right, there's never been a musician at Hyun’s age who stood out confidently in the Berlin Phil.”

“Thank you for your compliments.”

Hadn't I already become quite friendly with the Berlin Phil members? It helped a lot to have won over Concertmaster Samuel with the dinner and learned about the members' personalities in advance.

A proper speech and demeanor are basic. No wonder, having been a prosecutor and lawyer dealing with countless people and preparing for a congressional role encountering various types, I was adept.

At that moment.

“Hyun, Maestro wants to see you.”

The Maestro suddenly called for me.

Wondering if I had done something wrong, I pondered as I headed to the conductor's waiting room, but there was nothing to be faulted for.

Rather, I had adapted to the Berlin Phil more than anyone else over the past days. I would be the fastest to adapt among the members in history.

“Maestro, you called?”

Maestro Yuri had something to say. After a moment of hesitation, he spoke to me.

“Hyun, you know there's a Berlin Phil performance coming up, right?”

“Yes, Maestro. It's a free concert for the Berlin Academy and local residents, right?”

“Yes, it’s an annual event. It’s for the academy and residents who have supported the Berlin Phil.”

Despite being a free concert, the members' rehearsals continued without a day off. It seemed even more important than any other performance.

No wonder, showing subpar skills just because it's free would tarnish the Berlin Phil's reputation.

“Guest conductors always hope to one day have their own orchestra. But to do that, they need a lot of experience and symphony performances. How long do you think it typically takes for a guest conductor to become a permanent conductor at one of the world's top orchestras?”

“I’m not sure. Wouldn’t it vary by conductor?”

“Some take ten years, others more, and some never make it. The world’s top orchestras don’t necessarily promise a conducting position just because of skill. No wonder they say it’s a position chosen by the god of music. But sometimes opportunities arise for guest conductors too. Like if the scheduled permanent conductor fails to manage their condition or if there's a vacancy for an associate conductor.”

What was Maestro trying to say? My curiosity grew.

“How would you like to conduct the second part of the upcoming performance?”

“What?”

“Of course, if the members agree.”
