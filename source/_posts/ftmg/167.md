"Son, you have to drive carefully."

Mother's face was full of worry. It was only natural since her son, who had just become an adult, was about to drive.

In my heart, I wanted to tell my mother not to worry. After all, if you include my past life, I have over 30 years of driving experience.

"Don't worry, Mother. I've received good training from Mr. Kim. I'll drive carefully."

"Yes, dear. Hyun, don't worry too much. When I watched him drive last time, he was better than a lot of taxi drivers. Even Mr. Kim said he drives like someone who has been driving for decades. I think our son has a talent for racing."

Thanks to my father's joke, I was able to leave the house smoothly.

The reason I had my driver's license and car keys ready since morning was simple. It was the first orientation day at Korea University.

My face was already well-known, so I couldn't use public transportation, and I couldn't make a big scene by having Mr. Kim escort me on the first day.

"Kang Hyun is here!"

As soon as I arrived at Korea University, there was a bit of commotion. Didn't I make the front page of the newspaper last year with my solo concert?

People were very interested in my much-grown appearance compared to when I conducted a performance for the British royal family years ago.

So, imagine how my fellow students felt. I felt like a monkey in a zoo.

As I entered the small auditorium where the orientation was being held, I could feel the eyes of the already present students on me.

Even the seniors from the student council were wide-eyed, whispering to each other, "It's really Kang Hyun, Kang Hyun!"

Then, I heard someone calling my name affectionately.

Turning my head towards the direction of the sound, I saw a familiar face.

With a tall stature and broad shoulders, he looked like a bear.

Among the people I know, only the gangsters I met at the Western Prosecutor's Office had such a physique.

At that moment, I noticed the blue name tag on his chest.

"Kim Dae-woo?"

"Yeah, man! It's me, Kim Dae-woo from Daesung Middle School! Do you remember me? It's really good to see you!"

Finally, I recalled the face of the chubby Kim Dae-woo from my middle school days, the only friend I had during that time.

I never imagined that he would enter the same university and department as me.

"I often saw your stories in the newspapers and on TV. My parents were so proud to see you succeed. It motivated me to study really hard. I got lucky and got into Korea University with a great score. My dad is very fond of you. He says it's thanks to you that I got my act together. By the way, isn't your picture hanging in the teachers' office at Daesung Middle School?"

"My picture?"

"Yeah, I saw it when I visited Mr. Kang Bong-doo and Ms. Kang Hye-jung a few years ago on Teachers' Day. The principal always tells your story to new students, saying you're the pride of Daesung. It's funny, considering he used to criticize you when you were the top student."

Kim Dae-woo hadn't changed a bit. Though his appearance had changed, he still talked non-stop just like a friendly bear.

Then, Kim Dae-woo looked at me and slyly asked.

"Hyun, are you going to the MT this time?"

"MT?"

Of course, I had never been to an MT. I was too busy studying for the bar exam to bother with things like that.

While lost in thought, Kim Dae-woo looked at me with eager eyes like a baby bird waiting for its mother. What should I do?

"Nice shot!"

The golf ball drew a graceful arc and flew smoothly. The harmony between the body and the club, and even the posture after putting, was excellent.

His flexible waist resembled that of a young man. Watching the golf ball land accurately like an eagle aiming at its target, Chairman Wang clicked his tongue.

"Old man, have you been secretly eating something good for your body? Your swing seems better than last year. I'm not kidding; you might even hit 300 yards. What's your secret?"

Chairman Yoo handed the driver to the caddy with a faint smile.

Was it because the air at the Gapyeong Country Club was clear, or because he was in good condition? Chairman Yoo felt much lighter these days.

While others his age were dealing with presbyopia and osteoporosis, these issues didn't concern Chairman Yoo. To exaggerate a bit, he felt like he was in his 40s again.

"It's all thanks to Hyun. He's always nagging me to get health check-ups and eat things that are good for my body. This New Year, when he saw my health check-up results, he got teary-eyed. He must be really happy that his grandfather is living a long life. It made me tear up a bit too."

"You really hit the jackpot with your grandchild in your later years. I'm envious of you."

"Don't say that. You have Yooha, don't you? And Ilseon is doing a great job. These days, it seems like Ilseon is representing Jeil Group in all its external activities. Watching Ilseon makes me feel the passage of time. The little kid I used to give pocket money to has now become the head of the top company in Korea. Looking at him now, he seems even more charismatic than you were in your younger days."

Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo exchanged compliments about their children. Golf had long been forgotten.

"This is where Yooha made a hole-in-one last time. I was so surprised to see a young girl make a hole-in-one in one shot. Yooha's nature is just like yours. When she becomes an adult and joins Jeil Group, she'll probably impress even the most capable men."

"Hyun is even better. I'd love to put him in the strategic planning office. Even the picky Mr. Kim was so captivated by Hyun that I felt like my prized pupil was entirely taken away. But I understand. Just looking at Hyun is like looking at a majestic tree; it brings a sense of wonder and peace."

Gapyeong Country Club was a golf course that Chairman Wang had put his heart and soul into, so it was filled with rare trees, more so than most arboretums.

As he admired the stunning scenery of the golf course, Chairman Wang brought up a subject.

"By the way, now that Hyun has entered university this year, shouldn't we start planning?"

"Planning what?"

Chairman Wang elaborated with a straight face.

"Of course, I'm talking about the engagement."

"Pour, drink, until the alcohol is in!"

We took the Gyeongchun Line to the MT village in Gapyeong. Since it wasn't a total MT with all the departments, there were only about a hundred people, but we brought plenty of soju crates.

At first, the students whispered like they were seeing a celebrity when they saw Kang Hyun, but they soon got used to it and no longer showed it.

Even the new students, who were shy at first, became lively once the alcohol got into their system.

"Who's the most handsome new student?"

At someone's question, all the female students pointed at Kang Hyun. The rule was that the person pointed out had to drink soju.

It strangely felt good but also like I was being singled out.

The soju I drank after a long time tasted sweet, just like I remembered.

"Who's the most bear-like person here?"

This time, Kim Dae-woo was pointed out without fail.

Perhaps because they were still new students, everyone’s faces were as red as ripe persimmons after only a short drinking session. Especially Kim Dae-woo, whose face turned red like a grizzly bear.

Both the female and male students' faces were full of excitement. After all, they were burning youth who had just turned twenty. Moreover, nearby women's universities had also come to the MT village, so it was no wonder.

"Hyun, did you see the female university students who came around lunchtime? They were all staring at you. One of them even screamed. So, how about we go together later?"

"I'm not interested."

"Man, this is where love blossoms. Our female classmates really like you, but the seniors say campus couples aren't for everyone. Are you really not interested? Then we're going by ourselves. If you want to join later, don't expect any favors."

No thanks. I'm not interested in female university students, and if Kim Dae-woo goes to them now, they'll probably scream. A grizzly bear turning up all red-faced.

However, Kim Dae-woo's blueprints were unlikely to come true. Most people were either passed out or too drunk to function properly.

What a pity that everyone is such a lightweight when it comes to drinking.

"Excuse me."

It was when I stepped outside to get some fresh air. Someone called out to me.

Turning my head, I saw a woman I had never seen before. She was tall, with deep double eyelids, thin lips, and a mole under her eye.

She wasn't a student from our department who came to the MT, but she looked familiar.

How much time had passed? As I stared at her face, my eyes widened.

* * *

'My face worked after all!'

When Lee Yuri first saw Kang Hyun at the MT village in Gapyeong, she felt like her heart was going to stop. It was as if she had met the prince of her dreams.

She had always collected newspapers and magazines featuring Kang Hyun, so how could she describe her feelings?

If she could, she wanted to meet Kang Hyun through her father, who was a city councilman.

"Lee Yuri?"

Lee Yuri's eyes widened like saucers. Kang Hyun knew her name. How did he know?

Before the question could fade away, she noticed the name tag on her chest.

Come to think of it, everyone was wearing name tags with their names on them at the freshmen MT.

Realizing this, Lee Yuri gave a shy smile and a short nod.

‘Huh—!’

Kang Hyun swallowed a sigh.

Enemies meet on a narrow bridge, and here they were meeting at the MT village in Gapyeong. Though her appearance was more youthful and her personality different from what he remembered, she was indeed Lee Yuri.

How could he forget? She was the woman who had been his wife in a past life.

"Could you give me your number? I really like you."

"You like me?"

"Of course."

It was hard to suppress a laugh. Wasn't she the one who abandoned me when I had cancer in my past life? Disposing of me like garbage once I was of no use.

Well, it was a loveless marriage from the start, so perhaps the end was predetermined.

"I've really liked you for a long time. You look so cool playing the violin. I'm sure many girls have approached you like this, but I'm serious!"

To someone who didn't know, she might look like a devoted woman.

But in the past, how many men had she replaced? She had constantly been unfaithful even during our marriage.

Back then, I didn't care because I valued the political power more than her love.

"Oh, and my father is a city councilman."

How adeptly she uses her father's job as a business card. I almost wanted to tell her that her father would later be arrested for corruption.

I shook my head. This was an unnecessary connection that needed to be cut off firmly.

"Sorry, but I'm not interested."

"Why?"

Lee Yuri looked puzzled. Of course, she had never been turned down by a man she approached.

But some trees can't be felled even after ten strikes. Besides, I have a strong goalkeeper.

"This time, I have someone I like."

Genuinely.

This time? Lee Yuri looked puzzled by my cryptic words.
