"Son, you need to drive carefully."

The worry was evident on Kang Hyunja's face. After all, her son, who had just become an adult, was about to drive.

In his heart, Kang Hyun wanted to tell his mom not to worry. After all, including his past life, he had over 30 years of driving experience.

"Don't worry, Mom. I received good training from Mr. Kim, the driver. I'll drive carefully."

"Yes, dear. Hyunja, don't worry too much about Hyun. Last time, I saw him driving, and he drove as well as any seasoned taxi driver. Even Mr. Kim said he drives as if he's been doing it for decades. Our Hyun might even have the makings of a race car driver."

Thanks to his father's joke, he was able to leave the house with ease.

The reason he grabbed his driver's license and car keys early in the morning was simple. It was the first OT day at Korea University.

His face was already well-known, so public transportation was out of the question. And it wouldn’t have been appropriate to have Mr. Kim escort him on the first day.

"It's Kang Hyun!"

As soon as he arrived at Korea University, there was a bit of commotion. Hadn't he graced the front page of a newspaper due to his solo concert last year?

People showed great interest in his much-grown appearance, unlike his younger self from the royal performance in England years ago.

No wonder his classmates were so curious. He felt like a monkey in a zoo.

As he entered the small auditorium where the orientation was being held, he felt the gazes of the students who had arrived earlier.

The seniors from the student council were also wide-eyed, whispering among themselves, "It's really Kang Hyun, Kang Hyun!"

At that moment,

"Hyun-ah!"

Someone called his name affectionately. When he turned his head in the direction of the voice, he saw a familiar guy.

With his tall stature and broad shoulders, he looked as big as a bear.

Among the people he knew, the only ones with such a physique were the tough guys he met when he was in the Western District Prosecutor's Office.

At that moment, he noticed the three letters on the blue name tag on the guy's chest.

"Kim Daewoo?"

"Yeah, man! Daesung Middle School's Kim Daewoo! Do you remember me? It's so good to see you!"

He finally remembered the chubby-faced Kim Daewoo from his past life, the only friend he had in middle school.

He never imagined they would end up at the same university and major.

"I often saw your stories in the newspapers and on TV. My parents were so proud of your success. I got so motivated that I studied really hard. I hit the jackpot on the college entrance exam and luckily got into Korea University. Hehe, I probably made it in by the skin of my teeth. My dad really likes you. He says his son got his act together thanks to you. By the way, isn't your picture up in the Daesung Middle School office?"

"My picture?"

"Yeah. A few years ago, I saw it when I went to see Mr. Kang Bongdu and Ms. Kang Hyejung on Teacher's Day. The pot-bellied principal always talks about you to new students every year, saying you're Daesung's pride. It's so funny. When you were the top student in the school, they were so suspicious of you."

Kim Daewoo hadn't changed. Though he looked different, after a few conversations, he started chatting away like a talkative bear, just as he used to.

At that moment, Kim Daewoo asked him slyly.

"Hyun, are you going to the MT this time?"

"MT?"

Of course, he had never been to an MT. He had always been focused on the bar exam, finding MTs a nuisance.

As he was lost in thought, Kim Daewoo waited eagerly like a baby bird looking at its mother. What should he do?

"Nice shot!"

The golf ball flew smoothly in a graceful arc. The synchronization of the body and the club was perfect, and even the putting stance was excellent.

His flexible waist looked as if it belonged to a young man. Watching the golf ball land precisely where it was aimed, Chairman Wang clicked his tongue in admiration.

"Old man, have you been secretly eating something good? Your swing seems better than last year. It's no joke, I think you could easily hit 300 yards. What's your secret?"

Chairman Yoo handed the driver to the caddy with a faint smile.

Was it the fresh air of the Gapyeong Country Club, or was it because he was in good condition? Lately, Chairman Yoo felt his body was much lighter.

At an age when most people struggled with presbyopia and osteoporosis, Chairman Yoo felt none of those issues. He felt as if he had returned to his 40s.

"It's all thanks to Hyun. He always nags me to get health check-ups and find good things to eat. This New Year, he teared up when he saw my health check-up results. I wondered if it made him that happy for his grandfather to live long. It made my eyes well up without me realizing it."

"You are truly blessed with a grandchild in your later years. I envy you for having such a wonderful grandson."

"Don't be too modest. You have Yooha. And Ilsung is also doing very well. It seems that all the external activities of Daeil Group are now being led by Ilsung. Watching him, I feel the passage of time deeply. The child I used to give snack money to has now become the head of Korea's top company. Ilsung seems to have more charisma than you did in your youth."

Chairman Wang and Chairman Yoo exchanged compliments about their children. Before they knew it, golf had taken a backseat.

"This is where Yooha scored a hole-in-one last time. I was so surprised to see a child make a hole-in-one in one go. Yooha looks just like you. If she becomes a part of Daeil Group as an adult, she'll be more competent than most men."

"Not as much as Hyun. I’d like to place Hyun in the Strategic Planning Office. Even the strict Mr. Kim is so impressed with Hyun that I feel like my prized scholar has been taken away by him. It's understandable, though. Just looking at Hyun is like seeing a grand, majestic tree, calming and enchanting."

Gapyeong Country Club was a golf course painstakingly designed by Chairman Wang, filled with rare trees that even famous arboretums couldn't compare to.

As they admired the picturesque golf course, Chairman Wang brought up a topic.

"Now that Hyun has entered university this year, shouldn't we start planning? When do you think would be a good time?"

"For what?"

Chairman Wang feigned ignorance and elaborated.

"Of course, for the engagement."

"Drink up and keep drinking until the alcohol kicks in!"

They headed to the MT village in Gapyeong via the Gyeongchun Line. Since it wasn't a joint MT for all the departments, there were only about a hundred people, but they had loaded up numerous crates of soju.

Initially, the students were whispering about Kang Hyun as if he were a celebrity. But eventually, they got used to him and didn't make it obvious.

With alcohol in their systems, even the awkward freshmen began to liven up.

"Who's the most handsome freshman?"

At someone's question, all the girls pointed at Kang Hyun. The rule was that the person pointed at had to down a glass of soju.

He didn't feel bad, but it was strangely burdensome.

The soju he hadn't tasted in a long time had the same sweet flavor he remembered from his past life.

"Who's the most bear-like here?"

This time, Kim Daewoo got pointed at without fail.

Though they were still freshmen and hadn't been drinking long, everyone's faces were as red as ripe persimmons. Especially Kim Daewoo, whose flushed cheeks made him look like a brown bear.

The girls and the boys had excited expressions on their faces. They were young and full of energy after all. Moreover, female students from nearby universities had also come to the MT village, adding to the excitement.

"Hyun, did you see the female students who arrived around lunchtime? They were all staring at you. One of them even screamed. So, do you want to go check it out together later?"

"I'm not interested."

"Dude, this is where love blossoms. Our female classmates really like you, but the seniors say campus couples are not for everyone. Are you really not interested? If you change your mind later, don't expect us to include you."

No, thanks. He had no interest in female students. If Kim Daewoo went to see the female students now, they would undoubtedly scream in shock. Seeing a bear-like guy flushed red would be quite a sight.

However, the chances of Kim Daewoo's bright plans coming true were slim. Everyone was either dead drunk or barely holding on to their senses.

How could they be so weak with alcohol?

"Hey."

He was about to step outside for some fresh air when someone called out to him.

When he turned his head, he saw a girl he had never seen before. She was quite tall, with dark double eyelids, thin lips, and a mole under her eye.

She wasn't a classmate from the MT, but she looked familiar.

How much time had passed? As he looked closely at her face, his eyes widened.

* * *

"It worked! My looks worked!"

When Lee Yuri first saw Kang Hyun at the MT village in Gapyeong, she felt as if her heart had stopped. It was like meeting the prince of her dreams.

She had been clipping every newspaper and magazine that featured Kang Hyun, so her feelings were beyond words.

If she could, she would have used her father, a congressman, to meet Kang Hyun at least once.

"Lee Yuri?"

Lee Yuri's eyes widened like saucers. Kang Hyun knew her name. How did he know?

Before she could even clear her doubts, she noticed the name tag on her chest.

Come to think of it, it was a freshman MT, so everyone had large name tags with their names on their chests.

Realizing this, Lee Yuri gave a shy smile and nodded briefly.

"Huh—!"

Kang Hyun suppressed a sigh.

They say you meet your nemesis on a single-log bridge. He never expected to meet her at the MT village in Gapyeong. Though her face looked younger and her personality seemed different, she was indeed Lee Yuri.

How could he forget? She was his wife from his past life.

"Can I have your number? I really like you."

"You like me?"

"Of course."

He struggled to suppress a laugh. Wasn't she the one who abandoned him when he got cancer in his past life? She discarded him as if he were trash when he was no longer useful.

Well, it was a loveless marriage from the start, so perhaps the end was inevitable.

"I've liked you for a long time. You look so cool playing the violin. Many girls must have approached you, but I'm sincere!"

To an outsider, she might seem like a devoted woman.

But how many men had she gone through in his past life? Even during their marriage, she constantly had affairs.

Back then, he didn't care because he valued his status more than his wife.

"By the way, my father is a city council member."

She skillfully used her parents' occupations as if they were business cards. He almost wanted to tell her that her father would be arrested for corruption in the future.

He shook his head. It was an unnecessary relationship that needed a clear end.

"Sorry, but I'm not interested."

"Why?"

Lee Yuri looked puzzled. She must have never been turned down before.

But there are trees that won't fall even if you chop them ten times. Besides, he had a solid "goalkeeper" this time.

"I already have someone I like."

Sincerely.
