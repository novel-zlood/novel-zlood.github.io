“Father, it's chilly today.”

The last heat of late summer had already subsided. The cicadas, which had been crying all summer, had disappeared without a trace, and dew had settled on the grass at dawn. The signs of autumn were becoming evident.

“Dear, I'm not so weak as to catch a cold from this.”

It was true. Chairman Wang looked at least ten years younger than his peers. His eyesight was impeccable, and his teeth were white and even, showing that he was born with good health. This might be due to his determination to seek out anything beneficial for his body.

“You must have something to say to me?”

Golden carp gathered on the surface of the water, competing for the food Chairman Wang scattered.

“Father, you have an appointment in Pyeongchang-dong today, right?”

Chairman Wang's lips curled up. Indeed, he wasn't the type to visit without a reason. He nodded briefly, indicating to hear what was next.

“I was wondering if I could attend that appointment as well.”

It was a straightforward request. How could she be so audacious? But it made him like her even more.

“Do you know who will be at today's meeting?”

“Yes, Father.”

“You know that Kwangseok and Jungseok will be there, right?”

Chairman Wang spoke of the Blue House economic chief and the Bank of Korea governor as if they were his grandchildren. It wasn't an exaggeration because he had personally nurtured them as scholarship students of the Daeil Group.

“What's the reason?”

“Because the future of Korea will be decided at that meeting.”

In a way, she wasn't wrong. Of course, it didn't mean that Chairman Wang would single-handedly decide Korea's future. It just meant he would know the government's policies and directions ten steps ahead of others.

“Dear, then what can you do for me?”

There is a phrase, "equivalent exchange." A born businessman wouldn't differentiate between kin. But Chairman Wang already looked at his daughter-in-law with satisfaction. She was better than most men, with her boldness and sharp mind.

“Dear daughter-in-law, even if you were born a man, I would have brought you into our family by any means. In a way, it's a good thing for me and Il-sun that you're a woman. Otherwise, we might have faced an even fiercer tiger.”

As he aged, his sleep decreased, but his desire for capable people increased.

“Indeed, there's one more person I must bring into our family.”

Im Hyera nodded knowingly. Seeing this, Chairman Wang scattered the remaining carp food into the pond with satisfaction.

Achoo―!

His nose was tickling, indicating a sneeze was coming. It felt colder than a dawn in Moscow, perhaps because of the season change. Opening the window for ventilation had unexpectedly given him a cold. He quickly closed the window and tightened his pajamas.

Just as he was about to head back to bed.

“Kang Hyun, breakfast is ready.”

The housekeeper's voice called out. He had almost forgotten, having had breakfast in Moscow for some time. In Ichon-dong, mornings started before the rooster crowed, with the savory smell of soybean paste stew wafting through the air.

“Kang Hyun, how is the chemical research lab?”

His grandfather’s face was full of curiosity. Naturally, there would be an official written report about the Russian chemical research lab, but he wanted to hear his father's subjective evaluation.

His father carefully put down his spoon.

“Although the synthetic equipment is poor, they have carried out research on graphene comparable to ours and have published numerous outstanding papers in the material development field, indicating their rich technical resources. Furthermore, their ideas related to the commercialization of graphene are excellent. Considering the human resources of the research lab alone, it is impeccable.”

It was an era where material development was transforming into a material revolution. As his father said, human resources were more critical than ever.

The basic material technology team, which became the cash cow, was the cornerstone of Dongju, and the graphene research team would also become another cornerstone.

“What about the doctor leading the research lab?”

“He's not a bad person, but he is quite the eccentric...”

His father's voice trailed off, perhaps because the memory of Dr. Black Martin was too vivid.

At that moment, his grandfather suddenly looked at him. “Hyun, what do you think?”

Was he asking for an off-the-record opinion? “I liked him more because he was eccentric.”

“Because he’s eccentric?”

At first, he thought it was just a coincidence of names. But living together, he realized the true nature of Dr. Tikhonov. Like peeling an onion, there were countless surprises. Especially his blueprint for the future was chilling to Kang Hyun.

“After all, creating new materials requires free-spirited and creative individuals rather than those who are rigid and old-fashioned. In that sense, Dr. Tikhonov is perfect, isn’t he?”

Korea’s conservative culture was prevalent even in research labs, where junior researchers couldn’t contradict senior researchers. This was true in any organizational structure, and it was even more so in the prosecution office where he had worked.

However, the atmosphere in Dr. Tikhonov’s lab was different. Even junior researchers freely rebutted the opinions of senior and chief researchers. Perhaps the frequent tea times were also part of Dr. Tikhonov’s deep thinking. It was to break down the hierarchical structure, and if they joined Dongju, it would be like lubricating the stiff cogs.

After breakfast,

“Hmmm.”

His grandfather’s expression was grim as he read the morning paper. It was no wonder, as companies were on the brink of bankruptcy every day, and there were even reports that foreign banks had designated Korea as a high-risk investment country.

Although the Prime Minister urgently denied the economic crisis, it only amplified the anxiety. The flow of history quickened, but its framework remained unchanged. Many stars were falling in the political and business worlds.

He was also curious. What was Chairman Wang, known as the doyen of the business world, thinking at this moment?

“Hyun, do you have any plans for today?”

He was thinking of going to his studio to work on musical scores, but his grandfather’s expression was unusual.

“If you have nothing else, why don't you come with me somewhere?”

Where could it be? He looked at his grandfather with a puzzled gaze, but no answer came. His grandfather’s eyes were still fixed on the newspaper headline. The nightmare of 1997 was becoming a reality.

“Dear, I’m here.”

The place his grandfather brought him to was the ancestral grave where his grandmother rested. It wasn’t their wedding anniversary or her death anniversary, so why had they come here? But on second thought, there was no need for a reason to visit.

He stood up and pulled out the weeds around the grave. Although there was a caretaker, the weeds that grew thickly in the late summer sprouted again even when you turned your head for a moment.

His grandfather looked at him with a proud expression.

“I brought what you like.”

It was pumpkin pancakes, prepared without him knowing, and even the white milk that his grandmother loved. His grandfather was undoubtedly a romanticist.

As the bird songs in the mountains added to the atmosphere, his grandfather began to speak.

“Hyun.”

“Yes, Grandfather.”

He knew that his grandfather always came to his grandmother’s grave when he made a decision. It was a place of deep significance.

“I thought a lot after sending Beom-kyung to Jeju Island. What is the right path for Dongju? Although my children are not reliable, I considered entrusting everything to Kang Hyun, but you know. Your father is not that strong-hearted.”

It couldn’t be helped. His father’s nature was closer to that of a researcher than a manager. He didn’t fit into the jungle-like corporate politics filled with scheming and intrigue.

“But I believe you, Hyun, can do very well. It’s embarrassing for me to say this to someone so young, but please understand that I have no other choice.”

“Grandfather, don’t you remember? We already promised two years ago that if Dongju needed me, I would always lend a hand. If Uncle causes more trouble, I'll send him not to Jeju Island but to Tsushima Island.”

Of course, he was thinking of sending him to the main house, not Tsushima. His uncle's actions had nearly brought down Dongju.

He held his grandfather’s wrinkled hand. Unlike his past life, he had no significant interest in power or wealth. But for his grandfather, he would always protect Dongju.

“I’m going to take you to a special place today. But if you don’t want to, you don’t have to go.”

Where could it be?

However,

“If it's for Dongju, I’m fine with anywhere.”

At that moment, an unknown bird flew across the sky in a large circle, as if responding to his resolve.

‘Where is this?’

Outside the car window was a grand Western-style house. Tall red walls hid the interior like a fortress, and today the security was particularly tight.

He hadn’t imagined that the special place his grandfather mentioned would be the large mansion in Pyeongchang-dong.

But his grandfather’s steps were different from usual. They seemed more solemn.

As they crossed the garden lined with lush trees, a man in a suit came out of the mansion.

“Huh?”

He inadvertently let out a sound. It was a familiar figure. His hair, once graying, was now black, and his face had fewer wrinkles, but he was undoubtedly the professor who had proposed the Daeil Group scholarship to him at the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

Around this time, he would be at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, not the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

“Hyun, do you know him?”

“No, Grandfather.”

Well, how could it be different? That person was also likely on Chairman Wang’s list of scholarship students.

To meet an old acquaintance from a past life again, it was quite emotional.

As he moved forward, he glanced back slightly and met the professor’s eyes. His eyes were filled with doubt, probably because of his gaze.

Don’t worry; we won’t meet again in this life.

By the way,

“Looks like Yooha’s grandfather is busy?”

Usually, Chairman Wang would come out to greet them himself, but he was nowhere to be seen. The atmosphere in the mansion was also unusual. What could today’s meeting be about?

As his curiosity deepened, Im Hyera, the chairman, approached his grandfather.

“Sorry for being late, Chairman Yoo.”

“No worries, Director Im. I was worried I might be late as well. Who would have thought the traffic would be so bad on the way back from the ancestral grave.”

“No, everyone just arrived moments ago. You’re right on time.”

Everyone?

At that moment, Chairman Im Hyera’s and his eyes met. Her gaze was strange. She approached him and whispered carefully.

“I worked so hard to get into this meeting, but you get in with one word. No wonder Yooha likes you!”

She whispered quietly, but he couldn’t understand what she meant. He followed Chairman Im Hyera without questioning.

The place they arrived at was the reception room. Just as Chairman Im Hyera said, the guests had already gathered.

As the sliding door made of high-quality paper opened cautiously.

······!

His eyes widened in surprise. It wasn’t because of Chairman Wang sitting at the top seat but because of the other guests in the reception room.

Gulp―!

His throat moved involuntarily. Chairman Wang was about to introduce the guests to his grandfather.

The guests bowed to his grandfather and looked at him with curiosity. It was natural since he didn’t know why he was invited either.

Do you know who the guests were? Even if you don’t know my underwear color, you can’t forget their faces. They were figures frequently appearing on the media these days.

The Blue House economic chief and the governor of the Bank of Korea.

The sliding door closed, emphasizing the tight security.

Approaching 1997.
