"Father-in-law, it's quite chilly today."

The last heat of the season around Chuseo had subsided. The cicadas that had chirped all summer had disappeared as if they had never been, and dewdrops covered the leaves at dawn.

Autumn was slowly making its presence known.

"Daughter, I am not so weak as to catch a cold from this."

It was true. Chairman Wang looked at least ten years younger than his peers. His eyesight was impeccable, and his teeth were white and even, considering his age. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say he was naturally healthy.

Of course, all this could be attributed to his relentless pursuit of anything deemed good for his health, regardless of the cost.

"Didn't you come to say something?"

The golden koi fish rushed to the surface for the scattered fish food.

"Father-in-law, you have an appointment in Pyeongchang-dong today, right?"

A smile tugged at the corner of Chairman Wang's lips. Indeed, she wouldn't have come without a reason.

Chairman Wang nodded briefly, indicating she should continue.

"I was wondering if I could attend that appointment as well."

A straightforward pitch, wasn't it? How could she be so audacious? Yet, it was this audacity that made her more endearing.

"Do you know who will be at today's meeting?"

"Yes, Father-in-law."

"You know that Gwangseok and Jungseok will be there?"

Chairman Wang referred to the Blue House's Chief Economic Advisor and the Governor of the Bank of Korea as if they were his grandchildren. It wasn't an exaggeration, as he had personally nurtured them as scholarship students of the Jeil Group.

"And your reason for wanting to attend?"

"Because the future of South Korea will be decided at that meeting."

In a way, she wasn't wrong. Of course, it didn't mean Chairman Wang would subjectively decide the country's future. It meant he would know government policies and directions ten steps ahead of others.

"Then, what can you offer me in return?"

The phrase "equivalent exchange" comes to mind. A born businessman wouldn't spare his own family. However, Chairman Wang's eyes were already filled with satisfaction as he looked at his daughter-in-law.

She was better than most men. Such courage and intelligence were innate.

"My dear daughter-in-law, if you had been born a man, I would have found a way to bring you into our family. In a way, it's fortunate for me and Il-seon that you're a woman. Otherwise, we might have had to deal with a fiercer tiger."

As he aged, his desire for sleep decreased, but his desire for capable people increased.

"By the way, there's one more person I want to bring into our family."

Im Hyera nodded as if she already knew. Chairman Wang scattered the remaining fish food into the pond with a satisfied expression.

* * *

Achoo―!

The tip of my nose tingled, making me sneeze.

Maybe it was because of the changing seasons, but it felt colder than a Moscow dawn. I had opened the window for ventilation and ended up catching a cold. Hastily, I closed the window and tightened my pajamas.

Just as I was about to head back to bed,

"Hyun, breakfast is ready."

The voice of the housekeeper came through. I had forgotten, having been in Moscow for a while.

In Ichon-dong, mornings start before the rooster crows, with the savory smell of soybean paste stew wafting through the air.

"Hyun, how's the chemical research lab?"

Grandfather's face was full of curiosity. Even though there would be an objective written report about the Russian chemical research lab, he wanted to hear my father's subjective evaluation.

My father carefully put down his spoon.

"The synthetic equipment is underdeveloped, but they have conducted as much research on graphene as we have and have published numerous outstanding papers in the field of material development. Their technical resources are abundant. Moreover, their ideas regarding the commercialization of graphene are excellent. Considering only the human resources of the lab, they are excellent."

It was an era where material development was evolving into a material revolution. As my father said, human resources were more important than ever.

The technical team for basic materials, which served as our cash cow, was a cornerstone, and the graphene research team would become another cornerstone.

"And the doctor leading the lab?"

"He's not a bad person, but he's quite the eccentric..."

My father trailed off, as the memories of Black Martin were too intense.

At that moment, my grandfather suddenly looked at me.

"Hyun, what do you think?"

Was he asking for an off-the-record opinion?

"I actually liked him because he was eccentric."

"Because he's eccentric?"

At first, I thought it was just a coincidence of names. But living with him, I came to understand Dr. Tikhonov's true nature.

Peeling back the layers of the onion revealed numerous surprises. Especially his vision for the future, which sent shivers down my spine.

"Creating new materials requires a free-spirited and innovative person rather than someone stuck in old ways. In that sense, Dr. Tikhonov is perfect, don't you think?"

Korea's conservative culture was firmly entrenched in research labs as well, with junior researchers unable to refute senior researchers.

Well, isn't that the case in any organizational structure? The prosecutor's office I was in was no different, if not worse.

However, the atmosphere in Dr. Tikhonov's lab was different.

Even junior researchers could freely oppose the opinions of senior researchers and chief researchers.

Perhaps the frequent tea times were also part of Dr. Tikhonov's deep thinking.

It was designed to break down the hierarchical structure of the organization. If they joined us, they would certainly act as a lubricant for the stiff gears.

After breakfast,

"Hmm."

Grandfather's expression wasn't good as he looked at the morning paper. It was only natural, as companies were on the brink of bankruptcy every day. Foreign banks had even designated Korea as a high-risk investment country.

The Prime Minister urgently denied the economic crisis, but it only amplified the unease.

History was flowing quickly, but its framework was the same as in the past. Many stars in politics and business were beginning to fall.

I was curious, though. What was Chairman Wang, a giant in the business world, thinking at this moment?

"Hyun, do you have any plans for today?"

I was thinking of going to the studio to work on some scores, but Grandfather's expression seemed serious.

"If you have no plans, why not come with me somewhere?"

Where could he be talking about? I looked at Grandfather with curiosity, but he didn't answer.

His gaze remained fixed on the headline of the morning paper. The nightmare of 1997 was becoming a reality.

* * *

"Dear, I'm here."

The place Grandfather and I arrived at was the family burial ground where Grandmother rested. It wasn't their wedding anniversary or her memorial day, so why had we come here? But then again, did one need a reason to visit?

I stood up and started pulling out the weeds around the grave. Though there was a caretaker, the weeds that grew in late summer sprouted back up even when you turned your head for a moment.

Grandfather looked at me with a pleased expression.

"I've brought what you like."

It was pumpkin pancakes, which he must have prepared without me noticing. And even the milk Grandmother loved. No matter how you looked at it, Grandfather was indeed a romantic.

As the birds in the mountains added to the ambiance, Grandfather began to speak.

"Hyun."

"Yes, Grandfather."

I knew that whenever Grandfather made a significant decision, he would visit Grandmother's grave. It was a meaningful place for him.

"After sending Beom-kyung to Jeju Island, I've been thinking a lot. What is the right path for Dongju? Although I thought of entrusting everything to your father, you know well that he isn't cut out for it."

There was no helping it. Father's innate nature was more suited to research than management. He wasn't fit for the jungle-like corporate politics filled with intrigue.

"But I believe you, Hyun, can do an excellent job. It's shameful to ask this of you at your young age, but I have no choice."

"Grandfather, don't you remember? We promised two years ago that if Dongju ever needed me, I would extend my hand. If Uncle causes trouble again, I'll send him not to Jeju Island but to Tsushima Island."

If it came to that, I'd send him to a bigger place. Dongju almost collapsed because of Uncle's antics.

I held Grandfather's wrinkled hand. Unlike my past life, I had no great interest in power or material desires. But for Grandfather, I would always protect Dongju.

"I want to take you to a special place today, Hyun. But if you don't want to go, you don't have to."

Where could he be talking about?

However,

"If it's for Dongju, I don't mind going anywhere."

At that moment, an unknown bird crossed the sky in a large arc, as if responding to my resolution.

* * *

'Where is this?'

Through the car window, I saw a huge Western-style mansion. The tall red walls surrounded the property like a fortress, showing nothing of the inside. Security was unusually tight today.

Could it be that the special place Grandfather mentioned was this mansion in Pyeongchang-dong?

However, Grandfather's steps were unusually heavy. He seemed quite serious.

As we crossed the garden filled with lush landscaping, a man in a suit walked out of the mansion.

"Huh?"

I couldn't help but utter a sound. The man was familiar. Though his hair, which had been graying, was now black, and the wrinkles on his face were fewer, he was the same old professor who had proposed the Jeil Group scholarship to me at the Judicial Research and Training Institute in my past life.

By now, he would be at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office rather than the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

"Hyun, do you know that person?"

"No, Grandfather."

Well, how could it be different? He was probably one of Chairman Wang's scholarship students.

To think I would meet someone from my past life like this again, it was quite nostalgic.

As I continued walking, I glanced back. The professor also turned his head, and our eyes met. His eyes were filled with curiosity, probably because of my gaze.

Don't worry, in this life, we won't meet again.

By the way,

"It seems Yooha's grandfather is busy with something?"

Usually, Chairman Wang would come out to greet us, but he was nowhere to be seen. The atmosphere in the mansion was also unusual. What kind of meeting was this?

As my curiosity grew, Director Im Hyera approached Grandfather.

"Sorry for being late, Chairman Yoo."

"No, Director Im. I was worried I might be late for the appointment. Who knew there would be traffic on the way back from the burial ground?"

"No, everyone just arrived a moment ago. You made it right on time."

Everyone?

At that moment, Director Im Hyera and I made eye contact. Her gaze was peculiar. She approached me and lowered her voice.

"I tried so hard to get into this meeting, but Hyun, you got in with just one shot. No wonder Yooha likes you!"

She whispered to me, but I had no idea what she meant. Without responding, I followed her into the mansion.

The place we arrived at was the reception room, and as Director Im said, there were already guests.

When the sliding door made of high-quality paper opened,

······!

My eyes widened. It wasn't because of Chairman Wang sitting in the seat of honor. It was because of the other guests in the room.

Compared to the gentle ripple the professor had caused in my mind, this was enough to make waves.

Gulp―!

My Adam's apple bobbed involuntarily. Chairman Wang was about to introduce the guests to Grandfather.

The guests bowed to Grandfather and looked at me curiously. Their reaction was natural, as I didn't know why I had been invited to this meeting.

Do you know who the guests were? Even if I didn't remember the color of my underwear, I couldn't forget their faces. These were people who appeared on the news almost every day.

The Blue House's Chief Economic Advisor and the Governor of the Bank of Korea.

As the sliding door closed tightly, it felt like I was stepping into a page of history.

Approaching the year 1997.

I was taking a step into a significant historical moment.
