"When on earth are they coming out?" 

The atmosphere had started to buzz. The sound of clicking high heels filled the room, drawing everyone's attention to the entrance of a woman.

"I am Im Hyera, the representative of Jeil Gallery. I would like to inform you in advance that I will be handling the Q&A session in place of our gallery’s violinist, Hyun, who is preparing for a solo recital tomorrow. We ask for your understanding, considering Hyun's condition."

The journalists held their breath. They had not expected Im Hyera herself to appear.

Normally, the journalists would have bombarded her with questions, but this time, they couldn’t.

After all, who was she? She was the wife of Jeil Group’s chairman.

"Are you aware that renowned maestros from around the world have arrived? And that their purpose is to attend Kang Hyun's solo recital? What does Kang Hyun think about this?"

"He has no thoughts on the matter."

"Pardon?"

Im Hyera glanced at the prepared response sheet from Hyun and read it aloud.

"Even if those in the audience are famous maestros and virtuosos, until the performance is over, they are but a single audience. Violinist Hyun is focused solely on successfully completing the performance."

As polite questions continued,

"Is there a reason why the repertoire hasn't been revealed yet?"

"Most of the solo recital will feature Hyun's original compositions. Not revealing the repertoire to the audience can be compared to a wrapped gift. Isn't a gift wrapped nicely more exciting than one that's transparent?"

The audience, who had been quiet, buzzed again at the mention of original compositions. They had not imagined that Hyun would showcase his compositions in his first solo recital. Moreover, it was said to be "most" of the recital.

"I understand that the government is taking significant interest. Despite the country’s current difficult times, Hyun is remarkably contributing to earning foreign currency as a musician. What do you think about this?"

"As a citizen of the country, I think it's a duty. Additionally, we plan to donate a portion of the proceeds."

The government had been using sports stars who were performing well abroad in public advertisements to change the domestic atmosphere, and there were rumors that they had their eyes on Hyun as a musician.

At that moment,

"Can I ask a question directly to Im Hyera, rather than Hyun?"

"Yes, that's fine."

"There are rumors that Kang Hyun has a fiancée. Is it true that the fiancée is the granddaughter of Son Jangwon, the chairman of Daeil Group?"

Screech screech chirp chirp―!

The unseasonal summer sun had brought out the cicadas early.

After refreshing myself with a cool iced tea from a street vendor, I moved on and saw children playing marbles.

As I passed by the laughter of children playing around a utility pole, an old photo studio came into view.

"Student, is it not allowed?"

The old photographer looked at me with a pitiful expression. He was asking if he could hang the photo we took with my friends at the front of the studio.

"Just a moment, Grandpa. Can I use the phone?"

He was a kind-hearted old man who treated me with respect and helped create memories with my friends.

I picked up the faded receiver and called the hotel where my friends were staying.

Anna was out, so she couldn't answer, but all my other friends' responses were the same. Especially Eric, who laughed heartily and said,

-My face being advertised on the streets of Asia. I'll be even more famous now. Grandpa has good taste. I do have a manly face―!

When I nodded, Grandpa smiled brightly. He could have developed another copy and hung it without us knowing, but his conscience didn't allow it.

He thanked me repeatedly for allowing it. I'm sure Anna, who couldn't join the call, would understand this sentiment.

"Student, keep the photo fee. Receiving such a beautiful photo, I have some shame."

"No, Grandpa. Please take it. Otherwise, I won't feel at ease. And please don't lose this frame and keep it safe. I'll sign the back for you too."

"A signature?"

Sure, in just ten years, the people in this frame will all be famous musicians. The price would significantly rise.

Albert Einstein once left a note instead of a tip for a waiter, and it sold for tens of millions in an auction. Who knows, this photo might appear on a treasure show someday.

It was a small gift for the kind-hearted photographer grandpa.

Shouldn't I be resting for the solo recital tomorrow? No way, moving around as usual keeps me in good shape.

If you drink herbal medicine before an important exam, you end up with a stomachache in the exam hall.

Moreover, the bothersome press conference was handled by Im Hyera.

At times like this, she seemed like a superior who loved her subordinates dearly. But I kept recalling her words.

-Don't worry Hyun, Auntie will handle everything. They say a mother-in-law loves her son-in-law, right?

When I entered the mansion in Ichon-dong, shaking my head, my mother was watering the bonsai in the garden with a pleased smile.

"Son, go inside quickly. Two young ladies have been waiting anxiously for you in the kitchen."

What could that mean?

"Oppaaa―!"

"Hyun―!"

As I entered the mansion, Son Yooha and Anna came to greet me.

Before I could even say a word, they thrust a plate containing something in front of me.

One was a delicious-looking sandwich, and the other was a fragrant egg fried rice.

"Tell us which one tastes better―!"

They spoke in perfect unison, as if they were mirror images of each other.

It seemed that they had met privately a few times since our last meeting. There must be some women's talk that I don't know about.

Reluctantly, I took a bite of the sandwich and then a spoonful of the egg fried rice.

Both tasted like they were made by someone who had learned to cook for a long time. It was a tough decision.

My heart wanted to say both were delicious, but the gaze from the two women was intense. In the end,

"I think I like the egg fried rice a bit better."

At that moment, Son Yooha smiled victoriously and hugged me tightly. Anyone would think she had won an Olympic gold medal.

"I heard he'll be using two violins."

Hirose's face was full of curiosity.

"So, is it true?"

"Yes, sir. I heard that the violinist Hyun plans to use both a Stradivarius and a Guarneri at the solo recital."

There were instances where a violin was swapped during a recital. However, most were due to minor issues with the instrument, not to change the melody.

Switching to a familiar instrument suddenly is akin to changing the repertoire.

Moreover, the Stradivarius and Guarneri, while both string instruments, had completely different characteristics.

"Hyun always manages to surprise me. The accompanist today is Junghoon, right?"

"Yes, sir. Pianist Baek Junghoon is personally accompanying him. This news became a hot topic in Korea just a few days ago. Baek Junghoon reportedly turned down offers from prestigious orchestras abroad."

"I understand his choice. If I were Junghoon, I would have chosen Hyun too. Junghoon pursues the most sincere music."

Hirose had once performed with Baek Junghoon. He knew how much Junghoon loved music.

Perhaps the most excited person at today's recital would be the accompanist, Baek Junghoon. He would be right next to the perfect and sincere melody.

"I see members of the London Symphony. The conductor of the Berlin Phil is also seated. Sir, Maestro Gustav has also arrived."

Manager Goro swallowed a faint admiration and widened his eyes.

He had heard that renowned figures were coming, but this was beyond excessive. It felt like the entire classical music world was converging here.

It was like witnessing the eye of a hurricane.

"Goro, today, we can just be an audience."

At that moment, Hirose smiled faintly and became just another audience member.

* * *

More than 2,000 seats were filled without a gap.

Not only Koreans, but also a significant number of foreigners, which was unprecedented since the founding of the Concert Hall at the Seoul Arts Center. This was proof of Hyun's skyrocketing popularity abroad.

There were so many calls from abroad requesting additional seats at the concert hall.

William from the UK, Zhang Yan from China, Erik from Northern Europe, and Anna from Russia were all reminded of how remarkable their friend from Chapelle was.

Renowned maestros and virtuosos, whose names alone would make people stand up, were filling the seats. Even the iron-willed Erik looked nervous.

"Really, it must be incredibly pressuring."

They knew what it meant to perform on stage. Especially a first solo recital in front of such great musicians.

But Anna shook her head.

"No, if it's Hyun, he's probably preparing to go on stage as if nothing happened."

"That's right. Just like Anna said, if it's Hyun, he'll be fine. Remember, in Brussels, he was the only one who didn't get nervous. It was as if he swallowed the word 'nervous.'"

Everyone nodded at Zhang Yan's words.

Even at Chapelle, where the melody of dawn echoed endlessly, and at Brussels' Palais des Beaux-Arts, a stage every violinist dreams of, Hyun confidently played his music.

Not to be validated by anyone, but for the audience.

At that moment,

"Huh?"

The softly lit concert hall suddenly went dark.

The audience murmured in surprise at the unexpected blackout.

Buzz―!

A melody to calm the audience resonated from the unseen stage.

The audience stopped their commotion as if by magic. The clear and delicate sound of Hyun's melody was calming them.

Wasn't it too beautiful for a sound coming from within the darkness?

As if facing a gentle breeze by a serene lakeside, Moscow Conservatory Director Aleksei's cheek twitched.

'Not bad, you arrogant kid.'

The first piece in a solo recital holds great significance. But to present an original composition? The audience, though unfamiliar with the piece, was all ears.

Because it was dark, the melody felt like a guiding thread in a labyrinth.

As the tempo increased and the pulsating trills mimicked a heartbeat,

The chandeliers of the concert hall began to light up one by one.

As if guiding the audience, the sequentially lit lights finally pointed towards the stage.

Under the splendid chandelier, a boy in a neat tailcoat gazed at the audience with piercing eyes.

It looked like a painting. Moreover, the silver strings on his violin seemed to shimmer with anticipation.

"The beginning is enchanting."
