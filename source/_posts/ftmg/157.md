It was the year when Nostradamus's prophecy of the world's end was on the rise.

There were frequent mentions in the media that the millennium would not come, urging people to face the end. It was also the time when a new regime had been in power for a year amidst the financial crisis.

While common folks were talking a lot about the end of the world, the conglomerates were not.

Tap.

In a situation where white and black were in sharp opposition, the momentum of the black stones changed instantly as the upper right corner turned into a black territory. Chairman Wang, who had been staring at the Go board intently, finally lifted his head and smiled slightly. It was a clear smile of victory.

"Where did the person playing Go go?"

Adding to that was the usual banter often seen in Go games, intended to disturb the opponent's mood.

However, the man sitting opposite Chairman Wang had a face as calm as a serene lakeside.

His pupils, under his soft-looking eyebrows, were clear as if reflecting a soul, and his straight nose was extremely elegant.

With broad shoulders, lean arms, and long fingers, he looked like a scholar from a painting of handsome men.

Tap―!

At that moment, the long fingers holding a white stone placed it on the Go board with a sound.

Chairman Wang's eyes widened. It was a brilliant move that instantly changed the disadvantageous position of the white stones. The first move, which he hadn't understood, now perfectly matched the current situation.

Chairman Wang looked at Kang Hyun without hiding his surprise.

"Hyun, did you plan this from the beginning?"

"It's not that I planned it, but rather, Grandfather stepped into the picture I drew. By the way, where did the person playing Go go?"

"Whew―!"

It was impossible to gauge how many moves ahead he was reading.

Chairman Wang had also received personal lessons from a professional Go player for a long time and had quite high skills, but he was no match for Kang Hyun. It looked as if he was receiving a teaching game.

Chairman Wang stared at the Go board again, but eventually, he changed the subject as no moves came to mind.

"Hyun, I've heard from Manager Kim that you are investing in the IT industry these days?"

"Yes, Grandfather."

"I am really curious about how your mind works. You must be busy with music, yet you even draft investment proposals. They say Manager Kim was so impressed by your blueprint that he couldn't close his mouth. Could this old man have a look too?"

"Ah, just like that?"

Chairman Wang smiled pleasantly. Kang Hyun, sitting in front of him, had such a keen insight that even notable entrepreneurs couldn't easily present their business cards to him.

Furthermore, his blueprints for the future often surprised Chairman Wang himself. Hyun also had a clear stance on equivalent exchange.

Over the past two years, Kang Hyun had changed remarkably. Not only did his appearance transform, but the depth of his thoughts was also unfathomable.

"I wonder what you ate to grow up like this, Hyun. I am increasingly envious of Chairman Yoo. He has raised his grandson spectacularly."

At that moment, Chairman Wang, who had finished reading the moves, picked up a black stone and placed it on the board. It was worth the long consideration.

Isn't Go often described as a battle of momentum? It seemed like the black stones had another chance.

Just as Chairman Wang was about to smile with victory.

Tap―!

Kang Hyun placed a white stone with a sound, as if he had anticipated Chairman Wang's move. The black stones' large group was completely captured by the white stones. It was clear who the winner was without even counting the points.

Chairman Wang placed the black stone down and looked at Kang Hyun.

He had now roughly taken on the appearance of a young man. If he was this reliable at just nineteen, how would he look when he fully blossomed?

* * *

"Did you just come back from playing Go with Chairman Son?"

Grandfather seemed curious about who the winner was. When I told him the result, he burst out in hearty laughter, saying, "As expected, my grandson―!"

The dinner atmosphere was extremely pleasant. After all, Dongju's new material development had been successfully commercialized after two years of effort.

Because of that, my troublesome uncle was demoted and on probation.

"Grandfather, are you still getting regular health check-ups?"

"You rascal, thanks to you, I feel healthier by the day. The doctor even said that I seem healthier than him now."

In my past life, my grandfather passed away at the end of 1999. Knowing that made me worry.

But my grandfather seemed much healthier than in my past life.

The same was true for my mother and father. Unlike when they ran a laundromat in my past life, their faces were always filled with happy smiles.

"Son, have you thought about which university you want to go to?"

"University?"

"Yes, the principal called me a few days ago. The principal seemed very curious about your thoughts."

As soon as my mother finished speaking, my father and grandfather's gazes fell on me.

I couldn't believe the principal himself had called. It was no wonder, given that he always treated me like a treasure whenever he saw me.

But university...

"I haven't really thought about it yet."

Was it because my grades weren't good enough? Not at all. I had consistently excelled in both my class and the national mock exams.

In my past life, I studied so hard that I was called a studyholic, and now with advanced software, I was unmatched.

Moreover, the British ambassador's side was encouraging me to study abroad in the UK frequently.

There were so many places to go that I could practically have a free pass.

During vacations, I used to visit the maestro in the UK. Each time, the maestro said there was no need to attend a music academy or university just for music. He highly evaluated my potential.

He often said, mixing truth and humor, "Come to London quickly and take over my place!"

At that moment.

"Hyun, can you attend the meeting this time?"

"Meeting?"

"Last summer, you couldn't attend because you were in the UK. You'll be twenty next year, so take this opportunity to get to know some friends."

Oh, it was the meeting of the third-generation chaebols. I had been so busy traveling back and forth over the past two years that I had forgotten about it.

Given the times, the composition of the meeting members must have changed significantly. It was a gathering of those who survived the financial crisis.

However, by the time the founders stepped down and the second generation took over, the meeting became virtually meaningless. Despite that, why was I looking forward to it?

It was because of her, with whom I had only exchanged letters and phone calls over the past few years. Son Yooha, who I saw in the photos through letters, had grown a lot.

At that moment, my mother looked at me closely and spoke up.

"Son, do you have a cold? Your cheeks are red."

* * *

"Finally, next year."

Yuri, the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic, was looking forward to next year. Both the London Symphony and the Berlin Philharmonic had sent love calls to Kang Hyun. However, the reply was that he would decide after becoming an adult.

If other musicians knew this story, they would be speechless.

The reason Yuri couldn't give up on Kang Hyun was simple. It was because of the potential and ability he had shown.

After seeing him conduct for the British royal family, he was sure. It felt like being hit by a punch. Who would have thought he composed such a grand and large-scale symphony himself?

"Maestro, what do you think Hyun will choose?"

Concertmaster Samuel of the Berlin Philharmonic looked worried. Given that Hyun had alternated between visiting the UK and Berlin to learn conducting over the past two years, perhaps no one had confirmed Hyun's ability as well as Samuel.

"Wouldn't any choice be good?"

"Pardon?"

"I'm just curious about the child's future now. The maestro in London must feel the same."

Yuri was curious about Kang Hyun's future. Of course, it would be best if they could be together, but he no longer obsessed over the name Kang Hyun as he used to.

Rather, whenever he conducted with the child and had deep discussions about the interpretation of the symphony, he became more curious about the future.

Moreover, the symphonies composed by Kang Hyun were so impressive that even Yuri couldn't help but admire them.

Over the past two years, it was as if he was emulating Mozart, composing new symphonies every time.

The pieces that had not yet been revealed to the world were all masterpieces that would stimulate musicians' ideals.

The day those pieces premiered under Kang Hyun's direction, the world would once again be stirred.

"As a conductor who will open a new millennium."

Buzz buzz buzz―!

The atmosphere of the banquets where chaebols gathered had also changed significantly during the financial crisis over the past few years.

With the change in membership and a decrease in numbers, the time and place of gatherings also changed.

Instead of tilting wine glasses at banquets, they now gathered for lunch under the bright sun.

"Chairman Yoo, you've arrived―!"

As soon as we entered the venue, people rushed to greet my grandfather. It seemed like my grandfather's stature had increased even more over the past two years.

It was no wonder since Dongju Chemical's commercialization of new materials was changing the paradigm of the chemical industry with tangible results.

Anyway.

‘This place is the same as before.’

The actions were similar even though the members had changed. It was still a social gathering for building connections, just without the wine glasses.

At that moment, the true protagonist of this banquet approached me.

"Hyun, what will you do without Yooha today?"

Just then, Chairman Wang came over and teased me. It seemed like a lie, but Yooha really wasn't here. It was disappointing, as I had been looking forward to seeing her, but what could I do?

Chairman Wang, noticing that I was no longer disappointed, smiled slightly and greeted my grandfather warmly. Looking at the number of founders, it was evident that the times were changing.

Some of the founders had already retired from management and passed on their successors to the second generation.

Leaving the adults' conversations behind, I walked to where the third generation was gathered.

As I opened the door and entered, I felt piercing gazes. However, unlike before, no one tried to pick a fight with me. It wasn't just because I had grown taller.

Dongju had firmly established itself as a leader in the chemical industry, and I had gained quite a bit of fame over the past few years.

Now, even old people in the countryside could recognize my face.

‘There are some familiar faces.’

They were third-generation chaebols who had now roughly taken on the appearance of adults. Most of them must have returned from studying abroad for this occasion.

Many were sent to study abroad regardless of their grades. Smart third-generation chaebols like Yooha were rare, and there were few attending Ivy League schools.

Come to think of it, the old fox Chairman Wang also raised his granddaughter well. Among the third-generation chaebols, Son Yooha was particularly outstanding.

At that moment.

"Were you waiting for me?"

I heard a familiar voice and saw cat-like eyes.

Her long straight hair, shiny and reaching her waist, and her long limbs that could make models envious. Her skin was so fair that it almost looked transparent.

"You've grown a lot taller."

It seemed I couldn't deny it.
