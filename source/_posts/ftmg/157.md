It was the year when Nostradamus's prediction of the end of the world was gaining traction.

Around this time, phrases suggesting the end of the millennium was imminent were commonly seen, and it had been a year since a new administration took office amidst a financial crisis.

While ordinary people were abuzz with talk of the end of the world, the conglomerates were not.

Thud.

As the black and white stones clashed sharply, all the upper left stones turned black, shifting the momentum in favor of the black stones. Chairman Wang, who had been staring intently at the Go board, finally lifted his head and smiled slightly. It was a clear smile of victory.

"Where did the person playing Go go?"

Along with a teasing remark commonly seen at the Go board, it seemed like an attempt to unsettle the opponent.

However, the man sitting opposite Chairman Wang had a calm expression, as if looking at a serene lakeshore.

His eyes, under gentle eyebrows, were clear as if reflecting a soul, and his straight nose was extremely elegant.

With broad shoulders, unembellished arms, and long fingers, he seemed like a scholar straight out of a painting of handsome men.

Thud―!

At that moment, the long fingers holding a white stone placed it on the Go board with a sound.

Chairman Wang's eyes widened like saucers. The white stones, which had been at a disadvantage, suddenly turned the tables with a brilliant move. The initial move, which had been puzzling, now fit perfectly with the current move.

Chairman Wang looked at Kang Hyun without hiding his surprise.

"Hyun, did you plan this from the beginning?"

"It's not that I planned it; it's just that you fell into the picture I drew, Grandfather. By the way, where did the person playing Go go?"

"Ha―!"

It was impossible to gauge how many moves ahead he was reading.

Chairman Wang, who had also received private lessons from a Go player for a long time, was quite skilled, but he couldn't compare to Kang Hyun. It was as if he was having a training match with a master.

Chairman Wang stared intently at the Go board again but eventually changed the subject. He couldn't think of a move.

"Hyun, I hear you're having Director Kim invest in the IT industry these days?"

"Yes, Grandfather."

"Sometimes I wonder what goes on inside your head. You must be busy with music, yet you also draft investment plans. Director Kim said he couldn't close his mouth after seeing your blueprint. Could this old man have a look too?"

"Oh, not for free?"

Chairman Wang showed a pleased smile. Kang Hyun, who was sitting in front of him, possessed such insight that even seasoned entrepreneurs hesitated to hand out their business cards to him.

Moreover, his future blueprints were often enough to astonish Chairman Wang himself. Kang Hyun also showed a clear attitude towards equal exchange.

In the past two years, Kang Hyun had changed remarkably. Not only had his appearance transformed, but the depth of his thoughts was also unfathomable.

"I wonder what you ate to grow up to be like you. I envy Chairman Yoo more and more. He sure raised a fine grandson."

At that moment, Chairman Wang, who had finished reading the moves, picked up a black stone and placed it on the Go board. The long time spent thinking had paid off.

Isn't Go all about momentum? It looked like the black stones had another chance.

Just as Chairman Wang was about to smile in victory.

Thud―!

Kang Hyun placed a white stone with a sound, as if he had anticipated Chairman Wang's move. The black stones' large group had already been completely captured by the white stones. Even without counting the points, it was clear who the winner was.

Chairman Wang placed the black stone down and looked at Kang Hyun.

He had now roughly taken on the appearance of a young man. At just nineteen, he was already so reliable; one could only imagine what he would be like when his potential fully blossomed.

"You played Go with Chairman Son?"

Grandfather seemed curious about who the winner was. When I told him the result, he burst into hearty laughter, saying, "As expected of my grandson!"

The dinner atmosphere was extremely pleasant. After all, Dongju Chemical's new material development had successfully been commercialized after two years of effort.

Thanks to that, my troublesome uncle had been demoted and was now on probation.

"Grandfather, you still get regular health checkups, right?"

"You rascal, I feel healthier every day thanks to you. The doctor said I seemed even healthier than him."

In my past life, Grandfather had passed away at the end of 1999. Knowing that, I couldn't help but worry.

However, Grandfather seemed much healthier than in his past life.

That was true for my parents as well. Unlike when they ran a laundromat in my previous life, they always had happy smiles on their faces.

"Son, have you thought about which university you want to go to?"

"University?"

"Yes, the principal called me a few days ago. He seemed very curious about your plans."

As soon as Mother finished speaking, Father and Grandfather's gazes fell on me.

I couldn't believe the principal called, not even my homeroom teacher. Well, every time he saw me, he hugged me tightly and treated me like a treasure, so it was possible.

But university.

"I haven't really thought about it yet."

Is it because of my grades? No way, I have always excelled in both my class and national mock exams.

Even in my past life, I studied so hard that I was called a fanatic, and now with advanced software, I was unmatched.

Moreover, the British ambassador was constantly encouraging me to study in the UK.

I had more options than I could count, and I could even say I had a free pass.

I had visited the UK during vacations to meet the maestro. Each time, the maestro told me that I didn't necessarily need to attend a music school or university for music. He had high regard for my potential.

He often shouted, half-jokingly, "Hurry up and come to London to take over for me!"

It was then.

"Hyun, can you attend the meeting this time?"

"Meeting?"

"Last summer, you were in the UK and couldn't attend. Next year you'll be twenty, so take this opportunity to make some friends."

Ah, it was the meeting of the third-generation conglomerates. I had been so busy traveling here and there for the past two years that I had forgotten about it.

Given the times, the members of the meeting must have changed a lot. It was a gathering of those who survived the financial crisis.

However, as time passed and the founders retired and their successors took over, the meeting became virtually meaningless. Yet, I couldn't help but look forward to it.

It was because of her, whom I had only communicated with through letters and phone calls for the past few years. In the photos I received occasionally through letters, Son Yooha had grown quite a bit.

At that moment, Mother looked at me closely and spoke.

"Son, do you have a cold? Your cheeks are red."

"Finally, next year."

Yuri from the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra was looking forward to next year. Both the London Symphony and the Berlin Philharmonic had sent love calls to Kang Hyun. However, the answer was that he would decide after becoming an adult.

If other musicians knew about this, they would be speechless.

The reason Yuri couldn't give up on Kang Hyun was simple. It was because of the potential and strength he had shown.

After watching him conduct for the British Royal Family, Yuri was convinced. It was like being hit in the face; the experience was mind-blowing. Who would have thought he composed such a grand and large-scale symphony?

"Maestro, what do you think Hyun will choose?"

The concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic, Samuel, looked worried. Having seen Hyun's abilities firsthand as he alternated between the UK and Berlin for the past two years to learn conducting, Samuel might know Hyun's abilities as well as the maestro.

Isn't it too much to expect from a student who is just becoming an adult? Not at all. If you look at the symphonies Hyun composed, that argument would disappear.

"Wouldn't either choice be good?"

"Pardon?"

"I'm just curious about the kid's future. The maestro in London probably feels the same."

Yuri was curious about Kang Hyun's future. Of course, it would be great to work with him, but he no longer obsessed over the name Kang Hyun like before.

Instead, conducting together and having deep discussions about the interpretation of symphonies made him more curious about the future than the present.

Moreover, the list of symphonies composed by Kang Hyun left even Yuri in awe.

In the past two years, he composed new symphonies almost like he was imitating Mozart.

The pieces that had not yet been revealed to the world would all stimulate the ideals of musicians.

The day those pieces debuted from Kang Hyun's fingertips, the world would be abuzz once again.

"As a conductor who will open a new millennium."

Chirp chirp chirp―!

The atmosphere of the conglomerates' gatherings had changed significantly during the financial crisis of the past few years.

With a change in members and a reduced headcount, the venue and time of the gatherings also changed.

Instead of tilting wine glasses in banquet halls, they now gathered for lunch under the bright sun.

"Chairman Yoo, you're here!"

As soon as we entered the meeting hall, people rushed to greet Grandfather. Didn't it seem like Grandfather's stature had risen even more compared to two years ago?

It was understandable, as Dongju Chemical's commercialization of new materials was changing the paradigm of the chemical industry with visible results.

Anyway.

'This place hasn't changed.'

The members had changed, but their actions were the same. It was still a social gathering for building connections, even without the wine glasses.

At that moment, the real protagonist of this event approached me.

"Hyun, what will you do without Yooha today?"

Chairman Wang teased me as he approached. It seemed like a lie, but indeed, Yooha was nowhere to be seen. It was disappointing since I had been looking forward to it, but what could I do?

Chairman Wang, seeing that I was no longer disappointed, gave a faint smile and greeted Grandfather warmly. Seeing the number of founders, I could clearly feel that times were changing.

Some of the founders had already retired from management and handed over their reins to the second generation.

I left the adults' conversation and walked towards the gathering place of the third generation.

As I opened the door and entered, I felt piercing gazes. But unlike before, no one picked a fight with me. It wasn't just because I had grown taller.

Dongju Chemical had firmly established itself as a leader in the chemical industry, and I had gained quite a bit of fame over the past few years.

Now, even the elderly in rural areas recognized my face.

'I see some familiar faces.'

These were the third-generation conglomerates who had roughly grown into adults. Most of them had returned to Korea after studying at foreign universities for this event.

In a time when everyone was desperate to send their children to foreign universities, many went abroad regardless of their grades.

Like Yooha, intelligent third-generation conglomerates were rare, and there were only a few attending Ivy League schools.

Thinking about it, Chairman Wang had also raised a fine granddaughter. Among the third-generation conglomerates, Son Yooha stood out.

It was then.

"Are you waiting for me?"

Just then, I heard a familiar voice and saw cat-like eyes.

Her long straight hair, shiny and reaching her waist, and her long limbs could rival a model. Her skin, so fair that it seemed transparent, made her look stunning.

"Have you grown taller?"
