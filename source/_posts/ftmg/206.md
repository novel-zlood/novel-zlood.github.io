Damn it!

A large hand grabbed forcefully. Eyes resembling a tiger's were stirring with waves of emotion.

At that moment, Son Kangwook's brow furrowed harshly, like a fierce god.

"Damn it!"

He couldn't understand. Wasn't everything progressing smoothly?

It wasn't enough to have his father, the absolute authority, bedridden, but he even managed to dethrone the eldest son, Son Ilsun, from Jeil Electronics.

It felt like everything was unfolding according to divine will. However.

"Who is that old manâ€•!"

The secretary closed his eyes tightly. It was rare for Son Kangwook to ever show his emotions outwardly. But now, his face was turning red as if he was about to throw his nameplate.

The reason he was so agitated was simple. It was because of the new chairman of the Jeil Group who appeared like a comet.

"Sir, according to our urgent investigation, he was a farmer in Jirisan until now. His name is Kim Deoksu, and he is currently ninety-seven years old, almost reaching a centenarian. It was revealed that the chairman had contact with the old man three years ago."

"Three years ago?"

"Yes, sir."

It was unbelievable. Three years ago was when Korea was bustling with the foreign exchange crisis.

Did that mean they were transferring shares to an unknown third party since then?

But that wasn't the only thing he couldn't understand. Even the elders of the Jeil Group, known for their high pride, were polite to the old man for some unknown reason. As if they were dealing with their father.

"Is there any way to persuade him?"

"Currently, it is difficult to find a connection. Perhaps because the chairman prepared this person, he seems to be deliberately avoiding meeting with us. However, there are already many words spreading among the executives and affiliate presidents."

"It must be because a third party, unrelated to the Jeil Group, suddenly becoming chairman is unprecedented. Moreover, the person in question is an old man who is almost at death's door."

It wasn't wrong. The chairman position of Jeil Group was not one that anyone could occupy.

Moreover, from the perspective of others, he was just an unknown farmer. Who would want to give the captain's seat to such an incompetent person?

They had to overturn this at the temporary general meeting. But there was a hitch.

"Is Kim Namcheon not answering?"

"He hasn't been answering since yesterday. We urgently sent someone to Gyeongsan, but he refused to meet. His secretary only says he is currently out."

It didn't feel good. He was a man who was second to none in Korea when it came to calculating profits.

He was an old man like a snake who calculated his own gains and losses in everything. Such a snake-like old man suddenly cut off all contact.

Son Kangwook felt his lips go dry.

"Hyun, have you been composing all these scores?"

Karas couldn't hide his surprise as he looked at the scores piled on one side of the studio.

Indeed, it was the same reaction shown by every musician who had visited the studio. Moreover, weren't there even more scores than before?

"It was to not forget the inspirations that came to mind."

"Amazing. I wouldn't have been able to compose like this even if I was told to."

"You flatter me."

I hesitated for a moment and then brought up the topic.

"Maestro, may I ask why you are making your comeback stage with the London Symphony? I thought you would go to the Berlin Phil."

Wasn't he once a conductor representing the Berlin Phil? Moreover, the Karas Competition held in Germany was undoubtedly one of the top conducting competitions in the world. She and the Berlin Phil were inseparable.

"There's already a world-class maestro named Yuri at the Berlin Phil. Of course, the maestro of the London Symphony, Spencer, is the same. But the reason I applied without hesitation when I heard they were looking for a guest conductor in London is because of you, Hyun. You are the one who will lead the London Symphony in the future."

It was an unexpected story. I never imagined he would choose the London Symphony because of me.

The maestro didn't stop there and asked another question.

"Hyun, how about enjoying university life in London?"

"In London?"

"You could come as an exchange student, or you could take a break from your studies and live as a member of the London Symphony. It wouldn't be bad either."

"As a member?"

"Your violin skills are too good to waste. Rather than sticking to the position of a conductor, it wouldn't be bad to show your skills to the world as a violinist from time to time. Experiencing various paths in music isn't bad either. This is purely a suggestion from my fan's heart."

Come to think of it, hadn't I not held a violin on stage for a long time?

There was a time when I played the violin so much that my fingertips went numb.

For some reason, meeting the maestro made me feel like my dormant musical ambition was stirring again.

As evidence, didn't I want to pick up the violin right now?

"Hyun, shall we play the violin? I'll accompany you."

"Are you saying you'll accompany me yourself, Maestro?"

"Believe it or not, when I was young, my teacher advised me to become a pianist rather than a conductor because I was so good at the piano. Come on."

The maestro sat on the piano stool like a young girl. I walked toward the violin case that had been lying dormant.

My heart was fluttering as if I were meeting my first love again.

Mr. Deoksu came to see me again the day before the temporary general meeting. Hadn't he been wandering around like Hong Gil-dong for the past few days?

"Do you know the relationship between Jeil Group and Jeil Foundation?"

Mr. Deoksu asked me as if testing me.

"I don't know."

As if I wouldn't know the relationship between Jeil Group and Jeil Foundation.

Wasn't there a time in my past life when I worked under the director Im Hyera of Jeil Foundation? I knew the secrets of Jeil Foundation better than anyone.

At that moment, Mr. Deoksu looked at me with squinting eyes.

"Really?"

"Are you going to give me something if I get the answer right?"

"Of course, I'll tell you some very good news."

I was curious about what scheme this old man had.

"Jeil Foundation did not initially handle the role of the capital circulation that Jeil Insurance took on. It's been less than ten years since the foundation divided that role. Behind this was the power of Director Im Hyera. I don't know for sure, but the funds being circulated within the Jeil Foundation might have already surpassed Jeil Insurance."

"Then why hasn't Son Kangwook tried to take over this place?"

"As I said before, the foundation has the power of Director Im Hyera. She manages the foundation and the gallery not because she is the wife of President Son Ilsun. Clearly, Son Kangwook wants to draw a line with Director Im Hyera. I could explain more deeply, but I don't know any further."

The reason Son Kangwook couldn't take over the Jeil Foundation was because of Director Im Hyera. And the reason was her family.

Even though I knew all the secrets, I didn't speak them out.

Mr. Deoksu seemed quite surprised, as if he didn't expect such a detailed answer.

"You weren't just silently working on music in your studio. There aren't many people who know the relationship between the foundation and the group so well. Moreover, mentioning that Son Kangwook wants to draw a line with Director Im Hyera. It's natural. If he tries to devour her, he will be the one getting bitten instead. Click, click."

"Now, tell me the good news you promised."

"You impatient rascal."

Wasn't the temporary general meeting just around the corner?

But Mr. Deoksu was still relaxed. Instead, I was the one becoming anxious. What kind of trump card was he hiding?

At that moment, Mr. Deoksu looked at me and spoke.

"Go to Pyeongchang-dong."

* * *

On the day of the temporary general meeting, the tension was palpable.

The faces of the executives attending the meeting were all heavy.

It was the day when the fate of Jeil Group, which had left a significant mark on the Korean economy, would be decided.

Soon, Son Kangwook broke the heavy silence.

"First of all, I don't understand. How can someone who has never appeared on the frontline of Jeil Group suddenly become the chairman? I don't think I'm the only one who feels this way. I'm sure the executives and shareholders present here today feel the same. How can we entrust the leadership of a massive conglomerate like Jeil Group to a farmer who has plowed fields all his life?"

Son Kangwook scanned the audience and continued.

"Is this the Joseon Dynasty? Like King Cheoljong, who was chosen as a king just because he was a royal family member, even if there are shares transferred from the previous chairman, how can you place an old man who is almost at death's door in the chairman's seat? At least King Cheoljong was young, right?"

His eyes, resembling a tiger's, gleamed.

"I appeal to you all here today. Let's combine our strength to demand the resignation of the third party who has taken the chairman's seat. If we continue like this, the great ship called Jeil Group, with its long history, will repeatedly sail into dangerous waters, vulnerable to even the smallest reefs. The captain is someone who might not even know how to read a compass!"

The meeting room buzzed. The executives who had sided with Son Kangwook nodded, and even the shareholders joined in demanding the chairman's resignation.

Son Kangwook smiled faintly at the enthusiastic response. However, Mr. Deoksu remained relaxed, even picking his ear with his finger.

Then it happened.

"I don't want to be the chairman."

The meeting room, which had been like a stormy sea, suddenly became as calm as a lake with that one sentence.

Son Kangwook opened his eyes in disbelief as Mr. Deoksu continued.

"I mean it. I don't want the chairman position. It's a bothersome job for an old man like me. I'd rather receive dividends. Why would I go through such trouble?"

"Are you saying you accept the demand for resignation?"

"President Son, let's get it straight. It's not resignation; I'm walking out on my own. It's not a position that suits me."

"Then are you planning to go with a professional management system? Please clarify your intentions. It might be a nuisance to you, but for the shareholders present here, this is a matter of livelihood!"

At Son Kangwook's threat, Mr. Deoksu chuckled.

How could he lie so brazenly without batting an eye? He wasn't worried about the shareholders' livelihoods but his own future.

At that moment, Mr. Deoksu stood up. Like a dragon stretching, the entire room was overwhelmed by his charisma.

"There is no need for a professional manager; we already have the right person."

"The right person?"

"This person knows Jeil Group better than anyone and is unmatched in management in Korea."

At that moment,

Creak.

The central door of the meeting room opened. Instantly, all eyes turned toward the door.

From beyond the door, a figure appeared, and Son Kangwook's eyes widened as if they would tear.

Kang Hyun was pushing a wheelchair. And in that wheelchair sat,

"Fatherâ€•!"

The true king, with the face of a tiger, Chairman Wang.
