“Grandfather―!”

With an urgent cry, I approached the bedside. Chairman Wang's fingers were weak, but they were definitely moving.

At first, I thought it was just a reaction to the voice. But upon closer look, wasn't he dividing strokes as if writing letters?

Deok德...?

Focusing my gaze, I concentrated on the movement of his fingers several times. Indeed, Chairman Wang was struggling to write the Chinese character 德 (Deok).

I couldn't understand. Isn't Deok德 generally about realizing moral and ethical ideals? No matter how much I racked my brain, I couldn't figure out what Chairman Wang's message meant.

“Grandfather, what does this mean? Deok?”

There was no way an answer would come. It was at that moment.

Beep, beep, beep, beep!

The parameters directly linked to life, the vital signs, began to shake violently as if an earthquake had struck.

The once quiet room was soon filled with the cries of machines.

With a clattering sound from outside, the attending physician and nurses rushed into the chairman's bedroom.

“Please step outside for a moment!”

With the old doctor's order to vacate, I was practically chased out of the bedroom.

My hands were covered in cold sweat, while my mouth was dry as if filled with salt.

The housekeeper and the bodyguards were in the same state. Everyone was sitting uncomfortably, waiting for the doctor to come out of the bedroom.

How much time had passed? What felt like thirty minutes seemed like an eternity.

“Phew.”

The old doctor came out of the bedroom, wiping the sweat dripping from his forehead.

“Chairman Wang's vital signs were unstable due to his sudden exertion. For now, the only thing we can do is ensure he gets enough rest. It’s crucial to avoid any contact with others and not stimulate him.”

“Doctor, isn't there a way for him to recover through internal medicine?”

“Although the chairman is healthier than his peers, he's elderly, so we can't hastily decide on surgery. Even if surgery is considered, it would be best to do it after he fully recovers his condition. For now, his condition is gradually improving, so as I mentioned before, avoiding stimulation is the top priority.”

The housekeeper nodded as if it was a matter of national salvation.

There was no way to meet Chairman Wang anymore. The only relief was that he was safe for now.

But still.

Deok德.

Until I left the Pyeongchang-dong mansion, Chairman Wang's wrinkled fingers and the character Deok徳 kept echoing in my mind, like an echo from a mountainside.

“Professor, what do you think about Daeil Group?”

It was free discussion time in a law elective course. The topic was current affairs.

Professor Jeong's face stiffened momentarily at a student's question. Naturally, none of the people here, except for the student and me, knew that he was a Daeil Group scholarship student.

“It is undoubtedly one of Korea's top companies. However, legally speaking, Korean companies are still lacking. Compared to advanced countries, the legal system is inadequate, and the absence of punitive damages leads to rampant side effects. This is one of Korea’s future challenges.”

“What do you think about Chairman Son Jangwon's collapse?”

“Ahem.”

It was a student who always had many questions. Besides, isn't it a free discussion?

The biggest issue in Korea at the moment was none other than the news of Chairman Wang's condition.

After a moment's hesitation, Professor Jeong began to speak.

“Chairman Son Jangwon is not only the head of Daeil Group but also a symbolic figure representing Korea’s business community. His current hospitalization is a significant problem. However, in my opinion, Daeil Group may sway in the strong wind but will not fall. This is because the management system of Daeil Group has already been established by his successor, Son Ilsung.”

It seemed that Professor Jeong was aligned with Chairman Wang and Son Ilsung. The free discussion continued.

Initially, the students were hesitant, but as time went on, they asked me many questions. Even if the questions weren't related to current affairs, I answered them willingly.

However, as time went on, the questions became more excessive. If Professor Jeong hadn't signaled the students, it would have felt like a fan meeting. They were looking at me as if I were a celebrity.

“I'm back.”

After class, I returned straight to the Ichon-dong mansion. Although I wanted to drive my beloved car to Namhansanseong, I couldn't. The character Deok德 written by Chairman Wang's fingers kept lingering in my mind.

“Kang Hyun, have you had dinner?”

“I had a meal with a friend at school.”

“Oh my, I made braised short ribs for you, Kang Hyun.”

“I appreciate the thought, ma'am.”

I couldn't possibly make the lady set the dinner table twice. Besides, having university cafeteria food again after so many years surprisingly suited my taste.

But there was no sign of Mother and Grandfather.

As I walked into the living room, Grandfather was staring at the TV screen with an unusually serious expression. Mother and Father were also looking at the screen with tense faces.

[Evidence related to Jeil Electronics' accounting fraud has been reported to the prosecution. According to the information revealed by the prosecution, an anonymous informant reported key details about Jeil Electronics' accounting fraud, and the prosecution found it credible, leading to the arrest of Jeil Electronics President Son Ilsung, who was already under investigation for the accounting fraud. With the stock market expected to experience another storm tomorrow, let's connect with the reporter on the scene.]

The anchor of the nine o'clock news, with a tense face, announced the arrest of Jeil Electronics President Son Ilsung to the public.

Father's face was visibly shocked. Naturally, he never imagined that the prosecution would confront President Son Ilsung of Jeil Electronics.

Moreover, additional evidence related to the accounting fraud had been reported.

Son Kangwook had started to act in earnest.

“Isn't the meat delicious?”

The meat was juicy, with a hint of crimson blood seeping out.

Son Kangwook was cutting the steak deliciously with a sharp knife.

With the view coming through the glass walls of the high-rise building, it felt like a king’s feast.

“This is fresh Korean beef from Hoengseong. I specially ordered it for you all. With so many people, it cost quite a bit, but what can I do? It’s all for the beloved executives, so I endured it. Please, enjoy it.”

As if buying Hoengseong beef would really make a dent in a chaebol's wallet, Son Kangwook spoke with a sincere expression.

Around the long dining table, middle-aged men with stern faces were seated in a row. Despite eating the rich beef, their faces looked as if they were eating something sour.

“Chef, please bring some soju here.”

Along with Son Kangwook's words, green bottles of soju and mismatched soju glasses were placed on the table.

Son Kangwook personally stood up and poured soju into the glasses.

“For me, wine doesn’t suit my taste. For a Korean, isn’t soju the perfect match for meat? Everyone, let's drink together.”

Son Kangwook lifted his soju glass and downed it in one go.

“Ah, sweet.”

Although the soju had a high alcohol content, he looked as if he was eating chocolate with a blissful expression.

On the other hand, the executives' faces were still tense. It looked less like a dinner and more like they were at an uninvited funeral.

“I know why you all are uneasy. It’s because my brother was arrested. Naturally, as those who were in the same boat as my brother, I expect you have been under a lot of mental strain these past few days.”

“Executive Director Son, why did you call us here?”

“Good question! Director Kim.”

One of the executives asked Son Kangwook with determination.

“I know all your issues. To put it nicely, they’re issues; to put it bluntly, they’re corruption.”

“Executive Director Son, that’s harsh!”

“Director Kim, the harsh part hasn’t even started. With my brother arrested, Jeil Group’s reputation and stock prices are shaking. To be honest, I can’t understand people like you who are rife with corruption. Ideally, I’d like to cut off all your heads right now, but what can I do? For now, I must be content with just my brother.”

Son Kangwook's expression suddenly changed from playful to serious.

The aura emanating from his robust frame, along with his deep, tiger-like eyes, was reminiscent of Chairman Wang.

The executives fell silent, looking at one another. It was then.

“I’ll be straightforward. I’m giving you an opportunity.”

“An...opportunity?”

“Yes. Everyone makes mistakes, but what matters is not repeating them. Of course, this applies only to those who seize the opportunity. Who will go first?”

“Executive Director Son, what do you mean?”

The executives' faces were tense. With a faint smile, Son Kangwook put down his soju glass.

“Who will betray my brother first?”

* * *

It felt like the calm before the storm. Since the announcement of President Son Ilsung’s arrest, the stock market had been fluctuating like waves.

But it didn’t seem like it would end here. Naturally, Son Kangwook wouldn’t stir things up this much without a plan.

‘So he plans to make his move while President Son Ilsung is in custody.’

They say that when the tiger is away, the fox acts as king.

But Son Kangwook wasn’t a fox. He was another tiger—cunning and seasoned.

He would mercilessly reveal his claws to seize the now leaderless Jeil Group.

Damn!

At this rate, history would truly change. Chairman Wang had collapsed, and President Son Ilsung was arrested. Things were unfolding differently from the past life I knew. I couldn’t let this continue.

“Hyun, what brings you here at this late hour?”

It was dusk. The reason I sought Grandfather's study was simple: to unravel the mystery that had been plaguing my mind.

I explained everything that happened at the Pyeongchang-dong mansion to Grandfather without leaving out a single detail.

“Deok虎?”

“Yes, Yooha's grandfather definitely wrote that with his finger.”

“Deok虎...”

Grandfather furrowed his brow and pondered. But no answer came.

Naturally, it was too vague to infer anything from just the character Deok.

However, Chairman Wang wouldn't write a character without reason. It was then.

“Could it be?”

Grandfather relaxed his furrowed brow and spoke.

“Is he referring to Deoksoo 德水?”

“Deoksoo 德水?”

“Yes, you wouldn’t know, but a long time ago, there was someone who helped Chairman Son greatly.”

Who could he be referring to? During my time as a Jeil Group scholarship student in the past life, I had memorized Chairman Wang’s autobiography.

But there was no mention of Deoksoo in Chairman Wang’s autobiography.

“When Chairman Son founded Jeil Trading, the predecessor of Jeil Group, there was someone who helped him a lot. Chairman Son, who was doing wholesale business in North Hamgyong Province, moved to Seoul and was able to grow Jeil Trading safely thanks to Deoksoo’s help. To Chairman Son, Deoksoo was like a mentor or a father.”

“It’s my first time hearing this.”

“Of course, because Deoksoo preferred to stay hidden. Even I’ve never met him in person. Occasionally, when sharing drinks with Chairman Son, I’d hear about him. Chairman Son said that Deoksoo had far greater insight and skills than himself.”

I couldn’t believe it. Chairman Wang was described with numerous titles: the king of investment, sage, and master of management.

Yet, there was someone in Korea whom Chairman Wang revered to such an extent.

“It seems Chairman Son wants you to meet Deoksoo.”

“Grandfather, that doesn’t make sense.”

Naturally, wasn’t Deoksoo the mentor of Chairman Wang? If he were alive, he would be an old man looking at a hundred years, just like Kim Namcheon.

It was hard to believe he was still alive.

“Why doesn’t it make sense?”

“Pardon?”

Grandfather spoke firmly.

“Deoksoo is still alive.”
