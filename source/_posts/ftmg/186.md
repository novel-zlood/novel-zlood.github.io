"Maestro, are you looking forward to it?"

Doesn't she seem like an innocent young girl? Maestro Karas's wrinkled face was filled with a smile that had never been seen before.

The one thing that made her heart beat again after losing her child in vain was meeting a young man with a talent as vast as the ocean in a small Asian country, once considered a barren land for classical music.

Dudududung―!

The young man's conducting was still vivid in her mind.

His engraved-like conducting came as a surprise even to Karas, who had countless experiences as a maestro.

He harmonized with the orchestra members and instantly captivated the numerous audience. It would be accurate to say that they couldn't move until the conducting ended.

"My teacher once said that conducting should have a power that overwhelms the audience. That power comes from talent. In that sense, Hyun has immense power. He managed to instantly captivate even the most discerning musicians and left a great resonance in their hearts."

Surely, all the musicians in the audience felt it simultaneously.

He was still young, but the resonance he gave settled as a great vibration in their hearts.

To some, it might have come as frustration and despair, while to others, excitement and thrill.

"Maya, there seem to be a lot of people at the airport today, don't there?"

"Not only our security personnel but also people from Calvin Pharmaceutical Company. They say a major shareholder from abroad is visiting Austria today."

"Is it that pharmaceutical company that developed the new anticancer virus drug?"

Karas had also heard of the pharmaceutical company. Of course, the Austrian state broadcaster and newspapers boasted Calvin Pharmaceutical Company's tangible achievements as a national success almost every day.

A considerable number of people in suits were already waiting at the arrival gate.

Their expressions all showed evident signs of tension. One might think that even the Grim Reaper was arriving from beyond the gate.

At that moment,

"Maestro, they have arrived."

As the arrival gate opened and the passengers arriving in Austria appeared one by one, Karas's face broke into a wide smile as Kang Hyun's figure came into view.

The long-awaited appearance of the young musician was enough to make the old maestro's heart race.

Moreover, Karas's face even had the kind smile of a kind-hearted grandmother. Kang Hyun was walking hand in hand with his fiancée.

At that time, the executives of Calvin Pharmaceutical Company, who had spotted Kang Hyun, began to move busily. As if they were welcoming a boss.

* * *

I suddenly felt like a mafia boss. As soon as I stepped out of the gate, foreigners in black suits approached hastily.

If Manager Kim Sang-guk hadn't blocked them, I wouldn't have been able to greet the maestro who had come to meet me personally.

Only after escaping the crowd and getting into the car could I properly exchange greetings.

"Hyun, you must be tired from the long journey."

Karas's voice was as calm as the wind by a tranquil lakeside. The kindness in her green eyes was much like that of our grandmothers.

Karas looked at me and then turned to Yooha.

"Your fiancée's name is Yooha, right?"

"Yes, Maestro."

"You two make a really good couple. The more I see you, the more I smile. By the way, Hyun, do you know the people we saw at the airport?"

What should I say? When I mentioned it was a business relationship, Karas's eyes narrowed, as if she found it interesting.

"Hyun is truly mysterious the more I see you. Gustav was right."

"Are you referring to Maestro Gustav?"

"Yes. Gustav said to me, 'The more you experience Hyun, the more new aspects you see.' I've never seen Gustav praise anyone so much. He's usually very stingy with compliments when it comes to music. Of course, Hyun is an exception."

What kind of conversation did the two maestros have? It's hard to believe that the eternal maestro Gustav was stingy.

"By the way, who is the gentleman who came with you?"

In the rush, I forgot to introduce Manager Kim Sang-guk. By now, Manager Kim would be meeting with the executives of Calvin Pharmaceutical Company on my behalf.

Should I say he's my subordinate? But I couldn't do that.

"He's my manager, Maestro."

It was the moment when a future Prime Minister of South Korea transformed into a manager.

Then Karas looked alternately at Yooha and me with a serious expression.

"Hyun, when do you two plan to get married?"

"What?"

I unknowingly raised my voice. The Ice Queen, who always expressed her opinions, turned red like a beet.

Karas's eyes had a playful glint.

Not just an engagement, but marriage? No way, Son Yooha was still a high school student.

"Maestro, I don't mind anytime."

At that moment, Son Yooha spoke with a brazen expression. Karas smiled widely at her response, as if she expected it.

"We've arrived, Maestro."

At that moment, Maya, who was sitting in the passenger seat, spoke. The scenery outside the window left me speechless.

It was a grand mansion that one could mistake for an Austrian palace.

Even though I had experienced many grand mansions, I couldn't hide my astonishment. Yooha, the heir to the Jeil Group, had the same reaction.

"Isn't the house a bit big for one person?"

A bit?

I never imagined Karas would make such a joke.

To exaggerate, even a hundred people could live here without a problem. Considering the always-present security guards and housekeepers, it wasn't surprising.

The mansion had a large pond and fountain in the center, and various sculptures decorated it.

It looked like a palace from a classic European movie.

"This mansion was once a palace where an Austrian nobleman lived. I bought it. This mansion has a secret."

"A secret?"

"I hope Yooha listens carefully too."

Karas spoke firmly, looking at the mansion outside the window.

"Never open the door marked 0703."

* * *

"Wasn't the scheduled meeting next week?"

Manager Kim Sang-guk spoke fluent German. His sharp jaw and keen eyes made those who saw him feel tense.

It was understandable since they hadn't expected Calvin Pharmaceutical Company to come out to meet them.

"I'm sorry, we were eager to meet the CEO of VH Company as soon as possible and may have been impolite."

The executive's face showed evident urgency. Others also had a determined look in their eyes, as if they must meet Kang Hyun.

Why are they in such a hurry? One might think Kang Hyun was leaving tomorrow morning.

"We'll decide the schedule in Austria. I don't understand why Calvin is so desperate to meet our CEO. If it's about the development of the anticancer virus drug, we have no intention of interfering. This is not my decision but the CEO's, so please don't misunderstand."

It was a reasonable measure. Who could have imagined Calvin Pharmaceutical Company would achieve such success?

There was no need to meddle in a company that was doing well on its own.

Interfering in their research and development would be no different from Yubumjin and Yubumkyung, who tried to ruin the development of Graphene.

"The same goes for the meeting scheduled for next week. It will be a formal meeting, and the CEO will not interfere in Calvin Pharmaceutical Company's new drug development and marketing. So you need not worry too much. VH Company is an investment company, not a pharmaceutical company."

In other words, they wouldn't exercise undue power. After all, Calvin Pharmaceutical Company was already internationally certified.

But why were the executives so worried? Manager Kim Sang-guk was still trying to understand their expressions.

"That's not the reason."

"Pardon?"

"There is another reason we want to meet the CEO of VH Company. The person holding the future of Calvin Pharmaceutical is none other than your CEO."

What on earth does that mean?

"What do you mean?"

Although he was a major shareholder, he didn't hold enough shares to control the future of the company.

Even as Manager Kim Sang-guk asked, the executives exchanged glances.

Finally, the oldest-looking executive among them seemed to have made up his mind and spoke up.

* * *

"Maestro, I'll make some Korean food for you!"

To my surprise, Son Yooha rolled up her sleeves and spoke.

I should have known when she packed various spices like kimchi, gochujang, doenjang, and red pepper powder in her large suitcase. Moreover, her long years as a student abroad had made her quite sociable.

Thanks to Yooha's friendly nature, Karas couldn't stop smiling.

"Yooha, do you need my help?"

"Oppa, just rest. I'll take care of the cooking today!"

I wanted to stay in the kitchen, but what could I do? Thankfully, there were housekeepers to assist.

Karas watched Yooha cook with a kind expression.

By the way.

It's no wonder this place is called a palace.

It was so spacious that one could secretly live here without being found.

Moreover, the structure was complex, considering it was once the palace of an Austrian nobleman. It must have been designed to counter intruders.

"It's like a maze."

Looking at the long staircase on both sides reminded me of Hogwarts from the Harry Potter movies.

Luckily, there were maids around the house, so I didn't have to worry about getting lost.

At that moment, something caught my eye.

"Maestro?"

To be precise, it was a young Karas. A large portrait that filled the wall seemed to capture Karas's vivid appearance, as if it had been painted by a famous artist.

In the photo, a pretty child sat on Karas's knee, with eyes and a bright smile resembling Karas.

"It's Maestro's younger days."

A voice suddenly came from behind, and I turned to see Maya standing there.

She could have made some noise. I almost tripped on the stairs.

'The Maestro's younger days.'

I wondered if the child on her knee was her own. Comparing her younger days to now, the child must have grown up by now.

Maya seemed like she wanted to explain something but nodded and stepped aside.

If she had no work, she could have given me a tour of the mansion.

How long had I walked? The long hallway, resembling a hotel, was filled with numerous rooms.

Moreover, there were no signs on the doors, so I couldn't tell where I was without opening them. I wondered if Karas had used all these rooms.

At that moment.

Saaaah.

A cold breeze brushed my cheek, sending a chill down my spine. It seemed a window was open somewhere.

I turned back to retrace my steps but sighed at the maze-like hallway. It seemed I'd need the help of a passing maid.

Huh?

But the maids who had been walking around the hallway were nowhere to be seen.

I walked further, but I couldn't sense any presence.

What on earth was going on? Just as I thought that, I saw a door with a number written on it.

"0703?"

As soon as I spoke, a chilling sensation enveloped my entire body.
