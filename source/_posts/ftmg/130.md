“Special stage?”

Adam, the chief editor of Gramophone, tilted his head as if he didn’t understand.

“Maestro, if you don’t mind, could you please tell me exactly what kind of stage you’re talking about?”

“It will be a stage different from any previous Berlin Philharmonic performances.”

“Different stage?”

Adam's eyes filled with interest.

The reason was simple. Orchestras have their own identities. Especially the Berlin Philharmonic, which carries its unique color and melody like a tradition.

But a different stage from the past?

“Can you tell me more in detail, Maestro?”

Moreover, it was the Berlin Philharmonic, known for being particularly strict and cold as the Siberian north wind.

It was at that moment when Adam's throat bobbed up and down.

“A reserve member will be on stage.”

“A reserve member?”

Orchestras often had reserve members. However, it was rare for them to actually perform on stage. They were ‘reserves’ after all.

Even if a reserve member took the place of a regular member for some reason, what was so special about it? However, in the Berlin Philharmonic, it was a special event.

“Maestro, has a reserve member ever performed on the Berlin Philharmonic stage before?”

“Not once during my conductorship.”

Well, it felt like winning the lottery unexpectedly. The old saying that opportunities come when you least expect them was true. Stopping by Berlin by chance, he smelled a scoop. Questions continued like peeling a Russian doll.

“Is it the winner of the recent Paganini Competition?”

“If you mean William from the UK, no.”

“Then is it a member from another symphony?”

The Berlin Philharmonic, renowned as the world's best philharmonic. Most musicians couldn't even dream of getting a spot there. Some musicians made joining the Berlin Philharmonic their lifelong goal.

Even a reserve member would be extraordinary. Especially since it was an unprecedented move by the lion of Berlin.

“Since London has taken the lead, I will tell you who it is.”

“What? Taken the lead in London?”

“It would be someone the editor already knows. As far as I know, you were interested before I was.”

Yuri’s voice was tantalizing, like watching a fishing bobber dip in and out of the water. Slowly, the fishing rod was lifted under his cold gaze.

“It’s violinist Hyun.”

A big catch, not a small fry.

* * *

“Got a big one—!”

The first violin co-principal, Alberto, shouted excitedly.

A large fish was hooked on the fishing line that drew an arc.

Where were they? They had come to enjoy freshwater fishing with the members on a holiday. Practicing without any rest would only lead to mistakes.

“Hyun, did you often go fishing with your father?”

“No, not really.”

One of the members added, seeing me skillfully pull the fish out and remove the hook. I just smiled faintly, avoiding the topic.

Thinking back, I hadn't been fishing with my father. In my past life, and even in this one, my father was always working hard. When I go back to Korea, I should make time to spend with my father.

“The way you cast the fishing rod doesn’t seem like you’ve only done it a few times.”

“Is that so?”

“Yeah, many Germans go fishing with their fathers instead of playing catch when they’re young. Seeing your skilled movements reminds me of my father.”

Of course, in my past life, I had to learn not only golf but also hiking and freshwater fishing. Didn't I often go on outings with the deputy prosecutor every weekend?

On the surface, it was for health, but in reality, it was to hold on tightly to the lifeline. Golf, hiking, fishing—none could be neglected.

“Miguel, can I prepare dinner?”

“Hyun?”

“We’ve got fresh dinner ingredients now.”

The basket was full of big catches caught throughout the afternoon, enough to feed the dozen members.

“Hyun, are you sure?”

“I really wanted to treat the members to a meal at least once. I can’t miss this opportunity, can I? It’s a pity that not all the members are here.”

I answered Miguel’s question while handling the fish. Seeing how skillfully I was handling the fish with a small knife, Miguel seemed to be relieved.

Just then, Alberto passed by, jokingly saying, “We won’t starve, will we?”

‘Just wait and see.’

At that moment, the essence of Korean spicy fish stew unfolded at my fingertips.

The reddish color and spicy aroma stimulated the appetite. It would have been perfect with a shot of soju, but I settled for orange juice to calm my excited mood.

“Hyun, what is this dish?”

“It’s Maeuntang (spicy fish stew).”

“Really? Whatever it’s called, it’s amazing!”

Alberto, who had been skeptical, now exclaimed in admiration, moving his spoon continuously. The other members were the same. It might have been because they were hungry, but the Maeuntang was undeniably delicious.

I was grateful to the members. Through continuous practice, I realized anew. They were professionals and incredibly skilled. Their hands were full of calluses from their extensive experience.

“Everyone, thank you for accepting me.”

At my unexpected confession, the members, starting with Alberto, burst into laughter.

“Hyun, sometimes you seem like a student of your age, but on days like today, you seem like my peer. We accepted you not for any other reason. Your skill convinced us.”

Alberto said it casually, but I knew how much effort they put into accepting me.

For example, a young kid, whose forehead hadn’t even dried, stepped up to conduct them. No matter how important skill was in this world, experience and years also mattered.

Then Alberto put his hand on my shoulder and said.

“Hyun, there’s only one thing you can do to repay us.”

At that moment, the members who were eating Maeuntang all focused their attention. Moreover, Alberto’s usual playful eyes had a serious look. It wasn’t a bad atmosphere.

“Show us an amazing conduct until the end!”

When I nodded significantly, a big fish jumped towards the sky from the freshwater.

Leaving a huge ripple on the calm surface, a big tremor remained in my heart.

* * *

“Kang, you wrote the practicalization plan report for the Graphene project very well. Your reports always clearly show the context and main points. It’s as if the report speaks.”

Chairman Yoo praised Kang at the breakfast table. It was no wonder, as there had been a string of good news regarding new material development.

Kang’s skills were extraordinary. It was hard to believe he had once run a simple laundry shop.

“Son asked for another 2-on-2 golf match again. He must have taken lessons from a famous golfer. His confidence is so high it hurts my ears. Are you ready to knock down Son’s pride, Kang?”

“Leave it to me, father-in-law!”

Although Chairman Yoo was usually a man of few words at the dining table, he enjoyed conversations with Kang.

It was as if they were in perfect harmony. It was hard to believe that he had once pushed Kang away.

Meanwhile, Kang Hyun’s mother watched the scene with a satisfied smile. It was what she had always wished for.

“Kang, has my second son been visiting you lately?”

“No, after you scolded him last time, he hasn’t come around.”

“Good. If he shows up at the company again, break his forehead for me. You’re older than him anyway.”

In the company, there were few people Chairman Yoo could trust completely.

That’s how business always was. You had to always be cautious and read the other person’s true intentions. There were only a few people he considered his own, and Kang was one of them.

“By the way, when is our Hyun coming back? Hyunja, what did he say on the phone yesterday?”

“He seems to have a lot to learn in Germany. He said he had to practice, so we didn’t talk long. But I told him to call Grandpa when he has time.”

“That rascal. He really knows how to make people anxious.”

Then the housekeeper hurriedly entered the kitchen.

“Sir, please look at this!”

The housekeeper urgently handed the morning newspaper to Chairman Yoo.

How much time had passed? Chairman Yoo’s wrinkled eyes widened. The reason was simple. The face of the grandson he missed so much was on the front page of the newspaper. Moreover, the large headline immediately caught his eye.

-Violinist Hyun performs with the Berlin Philharmonic!

* * *

“As expected.”

Adam leaned forward with anticipation.

“Violinist Hyun, huh.”

It was an unexpected name mentioned by the lion of Berlin. The person he had longed to see was now collaborating with the Berlin Philharmonic.

As the first part of the Maestro’s performance ended and the second part was about to begin.

“I can’t see him?”

No matter how much he searched, Violinist Hyun was nowhere to be seen.

Then a boy in a dark tailcoat appeared on stage. The audience started to murmur, and Adam leaned forward, his eyes wide open.

Why? Because the boy held an old baton in his hand.

What on earth was going on?

Kang Hyun bowed politely to the audience and then looked at the members.

In contrast to the murmuring and confused audience, the members’ gazes were calm. Like the gentle ripples on a quiet lake, there was no disturbance.

It was proof of their trust in Kang Hyun.

Someone had once said, you shouldn’t sweat when conducting. It’s not you who should be heated up, but the audience.

Kang Hyun thought the saying was an excellent expression.

As he took a shallow breath, he felt as if his shoulder, passing through his elbow to the tip of the baton, became one.

Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 6, Pathétique.

It was a sonata form with an adagio 4/4 introduction. Kang Hyun’s baton and left hand began to move slowly as if soothing a baby.

As the deep tones of the contrabass resonated, the murmuring audience focused their attention as if by magic.

Like the sun gazing at the vast ocean, Kang Hyun scanned each member without missing a single one.

Every time the tip of the baton moved with the flow of the melody, the gloomy and unsettling motifs of Pathétique were vividly brought to life.

The woodwinds' melody rose like waves, subsiding at the tip of the baton, and the brass filled the void fiercely with a roar.

The strings softly embraced everything, giving the illusion that magic was unfolding from Kang Hyun’s fingertips.

Gulp—

Adam couldn’t speak. The Berlin Philharmonic members were moving under the boy’s fingertips. Moreover, what was this melody and flow?

The eerie bass and explosive anxiety perfectly captured the essence of Tchaikovsky’s Pathétique.

His sharp gaze penetrated between the members without hesitation, and the tip of the baton showed no sign of doubt. It was then.

Thud, thud, thud—

With the rising resonance of the trumpets, the motif reached its climax.

The hem of the dark tailcoat fluttered violently with the melody. The small boy’s shoulders moved ceaselessly, and the grand instrument followed his command.

In the fast rhythm of the scherzo, the timpani and cymbals’ powerful strikes, like an erupting volcano, marked the peak.

The audience held their breath as the motif unfolded. Their entire bodies felt drenched in sweat.

At that moment, Kang Hyun’s fingertips slowly pointed towards the members. It was a continuation of the melody that perfectly expressed the title of Pathétique. The audience, as well as the members, had tension written on their faces.

It was as if they were drawing the last note of Tchaikovsky’s life. In the sorrowful motif that felt like a sad dream, the pizzicato of the strings left a deep resonance.

At the end of that intense emotion, the audience shuddered. And they saw it. The world unfolding from the fingertips of the young maestro.
