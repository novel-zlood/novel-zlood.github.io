"God has helped us."

Barbara spoke in fluent Hebrew.

Who could have imagined that the mining industry, which started in Saxony, southeastern Germany, would grow this much?

There was a saying that mining had to be chosen by God. Especially finding a gold vein was not something that could be achieved by effort alone.

"Tanya, is this report true?"

According to the exploration team leader Kelik's report, the purity of the core, as well as the estimated reserves and distribution, were significant.

Moreover, the copper vein had reached the largest scale in the world. It was no exaggeration to say that they had been chosen by God.

"Madam Barbara, the exploration team leader is currently conducting repeated radial re-investigations. The more they investigate, the wider the range becomes, leaving them speechless. It's clear that we have discovered not only the largest copper vein in history but also a gold vein comparable to the one in Turpka, Nepal."

"I can't believe it, that a dying spark would revive like this."

Negative rumors about Barbara Mining were circulating in the market.

It was because, years ago, after the Turpka region, they had not achieved any visible results.

So much so that the stock market slang "Barbara Sell" was in vogue, with Barbara Mining's stock price constantly hitting the lower limit.

The group's board of directors even suggested selling Barbara Mining, so there was no point in saying more.

"Due to the stock price hitting the upper limit every day, the stock market is quite excited. They say on Wall Street that 'Golden Wednesday has returned.'"

"Golden Wednesday, huh."

Wasn't it thanks to Kang Hyun's help that they found the gold vein in Turpka, Nepal, years ago?

Back then, the stock market was full of stories about Barbara Mining's gold. It seemed like that day was being reenacted again.

It was then.

"Madam Barbara, we have detected something unusual regarding the stock price of the mining industry."

"Something unusual?"

"Yes, as you know, when Barbara Mining's stock price was hitting the lower limit every day, Wall Street managers also judged it pessimistically. They even said that Barbara Mining's stock price had climbed to the top of Everest. But in such a situation, someone was gathering stocks as if to show off."

Barbara's brown eyes gleamed mysteriously. Today's discovery was no coincidence.

Even team leader Kelik couldn't have imagined discovering both a copper and a gold vein at the same time.

When everyone said it was precarious, there was someone who boarded the shipwreck aloneâ€”who could that person be?

"Oppa, I'm really nervous."

Why is she like this? It's not her first time visiting the Ichondong mansion, yet she looks visibly tense.

Anyone who didn't know would think she was going to a formal meeting.

As they arrived in front of the red brick wall of the Ichondong mansion, Son Yooha took a deep breath. Perhaps the Ice Queen's personality had changed from her past life.

"Yooha, does the food suit your taste?"

Suddenly, the saying "a father-in-law's love for his daughter-in-law" came to mind. At the dinner table, Father kept talking to Yooha.

Anyone would think she was really a daughter-in-law, worried that the food might not suit her taste after living abroad for a long time.

"It's really delicious, Father."

I almost spat out the rice. It seems the more time she spends abroad, the more glib she becomes.

Son Yooha, like a demure new bride, covered her mouth with her hand and spoke as if delivering a line from a drama.

Mother, as well as Grandfather sitting at the head of the table, couldn't hide their smiles.

"So, Yooha, I heard you visited Korea University a few days ago?"

"Yes, Grandfather. I wanted to see Hyun oppa, so as soon as I arrived at the airport, I greeted the family elders and went straight to see him."

"Hoh hoh, I want to hear the details. They say love stories are the most interesting after watching a fight."

Grandfather, who usually didn't talk much at the dining table, gleamed mischievously.

Mother and Father leaned forward, pricking up their ears. Yooha, pretending to be shy, started to speak.

"When I first saw him, it was as if time had stopped."

I prided myself on having a poker face, but now my face was as red as a beet.

Of course, in my past life, I had never had a proper girlfriend, let alone a romantic relationship.

But Son Yooha recounted our story in such detail, like narrating a romance movie plot.

Her storytelling skills were no joke; it was clear that all her previous nervousness was an act.

Even now, she was capturing everyone's attention at the dining table during the crucial scenes.

"At that moment, Hyun oppa held my hand tightly."

"Oh my!"

"And then what happened?"

Dinner was already on the back burner. Mother clenched her fists like a girl, and Father urged her impatiently, as if waiting for the highlight scene of a movie.

Even Grandfather couldn't hide his pleased smile. It was then.

"I want to say more, but Hyun oppa would be embarrassed, so I'll stop here."

Son Yooha blushed and lowered her head. Mother looked regretful at not hearing the end of the story.

At the same time, Grandfather and Father's gazes turned toward me. They looked as if to say, "So, you're a man after all."

"Mother, I'll help with the dishes!"

Son Yooha suddenly stepped in between Mother and the housemaid. Mother's loving smile for Yooha hadn't faded since earlier.

"Yooha, will you peel it?"

"I'm good at peeling apples, oppa."

Who would have thought that the Ice Queen would peel fruit in her lifetime?

Sitting gracefully on the living room sofa with the fruit platter, she looked like a noble lady.

Her earlier words weren't a lie, as she peeled the apple perfectly. Grandfather was amazed by the smoothly peeled apple, like a single thread without any excess.

"Seeing Yooha peel an apple so well, she could get married right now. What do you think, Kang?"

"Father-in-law, you're absolutely right. In my life, I've never seen anyone peel an apple so well except my wife. Yooha is not only beautiful but also skilled; she's undoubtedly a perfect bride."

Hearing this, Son Yooha's face turned as red as a ripe persimmon, but she didn't stop peeling the apple.

Could it be that I feel like my nose is firmly pierced?

"The Barbara Chairman is visiting Korea?"

The President's Secretariat was bustling since morning due to unexpected information.

The chairman of Barbara Group, currently the hottest keyword in the U.S. stock market, was coming to Korea.

"What's the purpose of the visit?"

"The exact reason hasn't been revealed yet. According to available information, the entourage is expected to exceed a hundred people and will likely arrive on Barbara Group's private jet. Domestic groups have already obtained the information and are moving quickly."

Who is Chairman Barbara? Not only had they extended their reach into the mining and railroad industries within the Jewish community, but they were also known as the biggest player in the U.S. real estate market.

Moreover, they were known as an investment genius with deep insight and sharp wisdom.

Most importantly, given their current ranking among the top U.S. groups by market capitalization, it was natural for the President's Secretariat to react so swiftly.

In the wake of the foreign exchange crisis, attracting foreign investment was crucial.

"Report immediately if there's anyone among the domestic heads with connections to Barbara!"

Despite the urgent question, no one could answer readily. After all, Chairman Barbara was a hard-to-meet figure even in the U.S.

Known as a wealthy American with a thoroughly calculative personality, there were hardly any social gatherings or group exchanges involving them, making it unlikely for any domestic head to know them.

"It was reported that the visit was suddenly decided. Barbara Group is expected to announce the reason for the visit today, but they might not reveal the exact reason."

In other words, no one knew Barbara's true intentions.

"What kind of investment is this unknown person planning to make by coming all the way from the U.S. to Korea? How can we call ourselves the elite group of Korea with such slow information gathering!"

It was then.

"Chief, this is personal information, but..."

"Personal information?"

"Forbes once interviewed Chairman Barbara. In that interview, when asked which country they wanted to visit, they unusually chose Korea. When the interviewer asked why, they said it was because a friend was in that country."

A friend?

"Rumor has it that this friend is none other than..."

"None other than?"

The following words brought a silence.

"Violinist Hyun."

* * *

"Oppa, you're a really good driver."

Son Yooha still found my driving both awkward and fascinating.

She even complimented me on my driving. Well, with decades of experience, I should at least be good at this.

As we got closer to the airport, the slowing speed added to the sense of regret.

Coincidentally, the international airport was packed with people.

Among the busy people, there were not only ordinary citizens but also journalists and bodyguards everywhere.

The reason the airport was so lively was due to the scheduled arrival of Chairman Barbara today.

He had announced in advance that he would use the official entrance, not the VIP corridor, for the domestic journalists.

"Yooha, be careful."

Due to the many journalists, I took full charge of seeing Son Yooha off, as it was too crowded for both grandfathers to come out.

Maybe because I had pulled my hat down low, or because people were focused on Chairman Barbara's arrival, no one recognized me.

"Oppa, you'll come to visit in the U.S. often, right?"

"If you invite me, I'll definitely come during vacation."

Son Yooha, smiling like a child, hooked her pinky with mine.

Sometimes she's as aloof as an Ice Queen, but at moments like this, she's incredibly cute. She truly has a chameleon-like charm.

I walked around the airport with Yooha until it was time for her to check in. At some point, we had naturally linked hands.

"Oh, Michelle wants to see you again."

"Michelle?"

"The friend you saw at school. There's also Camilla, who's a fan of yours. She boasts about having bought several of your albums. Oppa, did you know you're very popular in the U.S. too?"

Who knew I had an appearance that worked in the U.S. too? It must be thanks to the well-produced album. But it seemed Son Yooha had a different thought.

"Don't you dare look at other girls while I'm gone in Korea!"

For a moment, the image of the Ice Queen from my past life overlapped.

Of course, who am I to take her words lightly? As the departure time approached, her frequent glances at her wristwatch grew more wistful.

Fortunately, all eyes in the airport were on Chairman Barbara, so I didn't have to worry about attracting attention.

"Oppa, thanks for treating me so well even though I came unexpectedly."

Son Yooha's hesitant and shy demeanor was incredibly adorable.

At that moment, without realizing it, I grabbed her shoulders and pulled her toward me. It was an instinctive hug, not a calculated one.

Yooha's cheeks blushed like peaches. It was then.

Huh?

I heard murmuring behind me. But Yooha only tightened her embrace around my waist, as if not wanting to let go.

Who knows how much time passed? The murmuring was soon accompanied by footsteps.

That's when multiple silhouettes came into view. What was happening? One hypothesis crossed my mind.
