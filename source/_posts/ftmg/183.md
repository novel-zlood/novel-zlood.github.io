Following the conductor's instructions, the oboe plays a long 'A' note.

After tuning is completed, the conductor steps onto the stage.

A handkerchief with embroidery is tucked into the pocket of the conductor's tuxedo, replacing a hankerchief.

The concertmaster swallows dryly, noting the confident stride and the absence of any signs of nervousness from the conductor.

"Kara...?"

Suddenly, the Empress of Austria, Karas, comes to mind. Karas was truly a maestro representing the 20th century.

Sharon is reminded of Carnegie Hall in 1983 by Kang Hyun's appearance. Although it was a memory from over a dozen years ago, it felt so vivid, as if Karas might appear at any moment.

Of course, Sharon's feelings were not solely due to Kang Hyun's confident demeanor.

His deep gaze, which seemed to resonate with the concert hall and observe everything, was the reason. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for Sharon to see Karas in Kang Hyun.

Moreover, today's performance would be of the same symphony conducted at Carnegie Hall in 1983, raising expectations even higher.

At that moment, Kang Hyun lightly bowed to the audience. Numerous audience members held their breath as they watched the stage. Even a simple gesture had the power to captivate attention as if it possessed a magical attraction.

A clear voice flowed out from between his beautifully angelic lips.

"Dedicated to the late Johannes Brahms."

Although it was common for performers to skip formal greetings, Kang Hyun was different.

"May his praise reach everyone."

Kang Hyun's voice echoed to the ceiling of the concert hall like a reverberation.

Who could call Brahms' symphony, which gazes into the inner struggles and the darkness of the sinking abyss, a praise?

At that moment, Kang Hyun's tuxedo fluttered as if swaying in the wind.

Swish.

The baton sliced through the air as if cutting through it.

The deep tones of the cello and horn resonated slowly, as if savoring the quiet autumn of life.

If Baek Junghoon's conducting style was iron-blooded, Kang Hyun's style was flexible. It was as if he was walking on the autumn ground where leaves were scattered.

Even with just the prelude, the audience was already licking their dry lips.

The pizzicato of the strings followed by the clarinet's timbre was enough to make the listeners feel a holy and lyrical atmosphere.

Every time Kang Hyun's shoulders moved, waves of melody surged. The faces of the orchestra members were filled with elation in the soaring joy.

It felt as if Brahms himself had taken the stage in his old age.

At that moment.

The end of the baton flowing down his shoulder became sharp, and as the hem of his tuxedo fluttered, the stage began to change as if a harsh wind was blowing.

* * *

"Whewâ€•!"

It felt as if I had run a marathon, with my back soaked in cold sweat.

When the performance ended and I stood the orchestra members up to thank the audience, I almost collapsed.

It felt as though I had poured out all my energy.

My heart was still pounding hard. My shoulders and elbows trembled as if I had done intense exercise, and the overwhelming emotions showed no sign of subsiding easily.

I felt like going back on stage and conducting with the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra again right away.

I washed away my excited feelings with cold water. When my bangs were soaked with water, a white towel was placed on my head.

"Good job, Hyun."

I wiped the water from my head with the towel. Looking up, Baek Junghoon was staring at me with the brightest expression ever.

"I never imagined you would use the trombone like that in the introduction of the 4th movement. I've always kept the chaconne form in mind, just as Brahms did. I was watching from the dressing room, and I stood up in surprise."

Indeed, Baek Junghoon was a conductor who perfectly fit the word 'musician.'

His attitude toward learning was also remarkable. Unlike many rigid and authoritarian musicians, Baek Junghoon never presented any false pride when it came to learning.

Moreover, he was always curious and approached everything with an inquiring mindset.

"When did you start preparing the vocal-like color of the 2nd movement? Even though the piece was composed in the Phrygian mode, I never expected it to be expressed so sacredly. If it weren't for us conducting together, I would have watched your rehearsal from start to finish."

We had stopped attending each other's rehearsals for some time, fearing it might influence each other.

Baek Junghoon started to share his stories as if he had been waiting for today. Seeing him like this, one might think he was a completely different person from the 'iron-blooded maestro' who exuded immense charisma on stage.

"How was your performance, hyung?"

"Me?"

"I mean, your conducting."

Baek Junghoon had been working as a guest conductor in Russia. He had come to Korea after hitting an invisible wall. I remembered him looking for me with eyes full of melancholy, soaked from the rain.

But the Baek Junghoon of today was entirely different.

"For the first time, I was satisfied."

"In what way?"

"My mentor always said there seemed to be something missing in my conducting. By stepping onto the stage today, it feels like I've filled that missing part. I can't articulate it precisely, but I feel like I've finally grasped the direction of the conducting I pursue."

Baek Junghoon's conducting truly was that of an iron-blooded maestro. It was as if a maestro from my past memories had been brought back to life on stage.

It's certain that Baek Junghoon would soon become a conductor representing Korea.

"By the way, did you know that Maestro Gilbert and Maestro Charles are in the audience today?"

"The principal conductors of the Chicago Symphony and the LA Philharmonic?"

"Yes, they are all eager to meet you, Hyun."

Indeed, after the performance ended, I hadn't gone straight to the dressing room but greeted the audience and the orchestra members first.

I was aware that many musicians were in the audience. The news had already reported that conductors from America and various parts of Europe had come to Korea, so it was impossible not to know. At that moment.

Knock, knock.

With a knock, Im Hyera, the director, appeared in the dressing room.

"Hyun, Junghoon. There's someone who wants to meet you both, and I think you should definitely see them."

Who could it be for Director Im Hyera to come in person? Could it be the conductor from the LA Philharmonic or the one from the Chicago Symphony?

But the elderly woman who appeared next left both me and Baek Junghoon with eyes wide open. The reason for such surprise was simple.

The Empress of Austria, Karas.

A legend we had only heard about had appeared before us.

* * *

"Maestro, how was it?"

It was an unplanned visit to Asia. Moving in secrecy, no one except her secretary and bodyguards, who were like family, knew about Karas's visit to Korea.

The reason for the legendary maestro's direct visit to Korea was none other than two young conductors.

"Maya, do you remember Carnegie Hall in 1983?"

How could one forget? It was her final stage and the performance that marked the finale. Musicians from all over the world, as well as the Vice President of the United States, attended, showcasing its immense grandeur.

"It felt like reliving that day. Not only did they conduct the same symphony, but the two young conductors also made the audience's hearts race. I intended to quietly watch the stage, but I felt compelled to meet them."

The reason for the excitement in Karas's eyes was simple.

It wasn't just a monotonous command of the baton. The intense joy emanating from his fingertips was incomparable to anything else.

Just as someone saw the Empress Karas in Kang Hyun, Karas saw her younger self in Kang Hyun.

"Now I understand why Maestro Gustav praised him so highly. I finally believe it. Now I understand why London and Berlin fought so fiercely over that young man. I wish Maya had seen the performance with me."

"Seeing Maestro smile so brightly is enough to satisfy me."

Indeed, Maya had served Karas for decades. It had been a long time since she had seen her smile so brightly.

After losing a beloved child over a decade ago, Karas had given up on conducting and everything else.

But now, she had returned to being like a curious young girl.

"Baek Junghoon is an amazing conductor, but Kang Hyun was astonishing in a different way. I never imagined he would reinterpret Brahms's masterpiece so brilliantly. If Johannes Brahms were alive, he would surely praise Hyun."

"Was it that impressive?"

"The audience's faces were filled with joy, and the orchestra members who played with Hyun were blessed. It was that remarkable."

Maya had never seen the maestro praise anyone like this. After all, she had become a world-renowned conductor even before turning thirty.

Karas's eyes, gazing out the car window, were filled with an unprecedented vitality.

"Maya, should we invite Hyun to Austria?"

* * *

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the classical music world was abuzz. The news of the Empress of Austria, Karas, visiting Korea was nothing short of shocking.

It was understandable since Karas had completely hidden herself from the world after her last conducting at Carnegie Hall in 1983.

"This is so embarrassing."

I covered my face with both hands.

Newspaper articles and news headlines were filled with stories about me.

Especially after the documentary, the national interest in me had soared. They even delved into whether I had a girlfriend and exaggerated my life story as if it were a bag of chips with too much air.

My mother even received a casting call from a TV program about parenting methods, so there's no need to say more.

"Son, I like this article's title. 'Sons of Korea Shake the World.' Your and Junghoon's faces are right on the front page."

"The articles are exaggerated. It's not to that extent."

It's practically nationalistic pride. Some even speculated that the legendary Maestro Karas visited Korea to make me her disciple.

That's not all. A private weekly magazine even spread the rumor that I was the hidden son-in-law of a prominent group.

"Honey, are there still reporters outside?"

"The police came and cleared them out, but it seems they've returned."

My father shook his head in frustration.

Indeed, I had attracted paparazzi typically associated with famous stars. I could fully understand how Hollywood celebrities felt about being hounded by paparazzi.

It seemed wise to stay out of the public eye for a while. At that moment.

The doorbell rang, and the housekeeper came looking for me with a surprised expression.

"Kang Hyun, there are guests outside, but I can't speak English."

"What?"

"There are foreigners here."

Foreigners?

Could it be Spencer from London?

Crossing the garden and stepping outside the mansion, I saw an unexpected figure.

The Empress Karas stood there with a kind expression like a benevolent grandmother. Beside her was a middle-aged woman who appeared to be her secretary.

This was the second time. I had never encountered the legendary maestro in my past life, even in my memories.

"Maestro, how did you come all the way here?"

I was sure she had boarded a flight to Austria.

"Oppaâ€•!"

At that moment, another figure appeared behind the maestro. It was none other than Son Yooha, who was still in Korea, visiting the mansion in Ichon-dong.

While I was bewildered by the appearance of the two women, I suddenly remembered that reporters were swarming around.
