"Chairman, we are currently pushing for the expansion of the LCD division and the mobile display division. We also plan to invest funds into the biotechnology field, in addition to the existing electronics sector. Due to the procedural delays in the biotechnology field within the country, we have expanded our operations to Russia and India. We have also taken legal steps with both the ruling and opposition parties for the reverse merger of Mojik and Cheil Industries."

In the library of the grand mansion in Pyeongchang-dong, Chairman Wang and Son Ilseon were sitting across from each other.

Son Ilseon was briefing Chairman Wang on the long-term ten-year plan for the future of Cheil Group.

Cheil Group's progress was faster than any other company. Continuing to run forward without stopping at success was the motto of Cheil.

While other conglomerates could see ten steps ahead, Cheil Group was already looking a hundred steps ahead.

Of course, behind this was the constant advice of Chairman Wang.

"Ilseon, moving quickly in response to changing times is good, but sometimes, you need to stand still and check if there are any mistakes. Along with the expansion in Russia and India, now we need to find a pathway in China, where we have already paved the way. Moreover, push for the expansion of the strategic planning office, which acts as the brain of the company. In times like these, gathering more talent is crucial. Also, it's better to replace Kim Yongho from the textile sector and Heo Seonggil from electronics at the right time. They are capable, but those who talk too much often end up in trouble."

"I will keep that in mind."

Son Ilseon tried hard to hide his surprise. His father was a person who could foresee a thousand miles even while sitting.

Certainly, he knew every detail of the company's big and small parts. It was probably such management skills that made him the giant of South Korea's business world.

Chairman Wang continued to read the report Son Ilseon had written for a long time.

Even though they were father and son, Son Ilseon couldn't read Chairman Wang's expression at all. After all, his poker face was already a famous mask in the business world.

At that moment, a faint smile appeared on Chairman Wang's unchanged face.

"I believe you, Ilseon, will lead the group well in the future."

Son Ilseon widened his eyes. It was something he hadn't heard often from his father. Although he was already over forty, his father always pointed out his mistakes as if dealing with a child.

Chairman Wang patted Son Ilseon's shoulder and stood up.

"Times are changing now."

Sssspio... ssspio... buzzzzâ€•!

Though it was early in the morning, the Ichon-dong mansion was filled with a fragrant smell, reminiscent of a holiday, along with the early sounds announcing the start of summer.

In the kitchen, the housemaid and the mother were bickering while preparing breakfast. The housemaid, who had been working in the Ichon-dong mansion for a long time, practically pushed the mother out of the kitchen and said,

"Miss, you should go and rest."

"Ma'am, it's still okay for me. I'm not even full."

"What if you get morning sickness? I'm really worried..."

"When I was pregnant with Hyun, I didn't have morning sickness. I'll be fine."

The housemaid had taken care of the Ichon-dong siblings in place of their mother when they were young. The mother had a special affection for the housemaid. Around that time, Kang Hyun, with a towel around his neck, came downstairs.

"What's that good smell?"

In the kitchen, there was japchae, justifying the fragrant smell. When Kang Hyun tried to eat it with his bare hands, the mother was startled and waved her hand.

"Hey, I told you to use chopsticks."

At that moment, the grandfather also came into the kitchen. Soon, a lavish feast was laid out on the table.

Even in usual times, Ichon-dong had many side dishes, but ever since the mother became pregnant, it became as luxurious as a 12-dish Jeolla-do meal.

Then, the grandfather asked about his son-in-law, who was not seen at the breakfast table.

"Hyunja, is Kang still sleeping?"

His father usually started breakfast faster than the grandfather.

"No, father."

"Then where did he go? Not coming to the breakfast table."

"Well..."

The mother, looking a bit embarrassed, hesitated before continuing.

"I said I wanted strawberries. He left about thirty minutes ago to get them at the dawn market. I told him it was okay, but he left in such a hurry that I couldn't stop him..."

"Hahaha. Our Hyunja really married well. Kang may seem stoic at work, but he's quite the romantic."

Certainly, the grandfather was no less of a romantic. Whenever he missed the grandmother, he would make pumpkin pancakes and visit her grave.

How much time had passed? When the breakfast was over and everyone was gathered in the living room.

"Dear, try some strawberries. They're from a greenhouse."

Even in the middle of summer, the father was so devoted that he went to the dawn market to get strawberries for the mother.

Though the mother said she was okay, the father not only washed the strawberries himself but also carefully fed them to her. The mother's face still showed signs of embarrassment.

However, Kang Hyun thought that his parents' appearance was more beautiful than ever.

[Minister of Culture and Sports, Kim Gap-seong, is inspecting the stadiums for the World Cup to be jointly held in Korea and Japan next year. The head coach of the national team has been appointed as Guus Hiddink, who managed the Netherlands national team during the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. There is great anticipation for what kind of miracle our national team will achieve in the Korea-Japan World Cup next year.]

The morning news was broadcasting the 2002 World Cup as the main story. At that moment, the father, eating strawberries, casually said,

"It's hard to believe that the World Cup will be held in our country, just like the 88 Olympics."

"Kang, how far do you think our country will go? I think we could potentially reach the round of 16."

"Father-in-law, I also hope our country makes it to the round of 16, but given the objective FIFA rankings, there is a significant gap. If we make it to the round of 16, it would be a national celebration."

The prediction for the World Cup was mostly skeptical. The prevailing opinion was that even the round of 16 would be the end. In a way, it was natural. Given the current state of the national team, even making it to the round of 16 was considered a miracle by experts.

"Then how about we make a bet among ourselves? Whoever correctly predicts how far our country will go will get something they want. I think we'll reach the round of 16, and Kang doesn't think we'll make it to the round of 16."

At that moment, the grandfather looked at Kang Hyun and asked,

"Hyun, what do you think?"

Kang Hyun smiled faintly and looked at the face of Guus Hiddink, reflected in the TV screen.

How could he forget? Even when he was focused on his bar exam studies, the whole country was in an uproar during the World Cup games. With a confident voice, Kang Hyun said,

"We'll make it to the semi-finals."

"Yooha, you're going to Korea this time, right?"

Students from the prestigious Phillips Academy don't take breaks even during vacations. Most of them are heirs of prominent families in politics and business, so they are busy with heir lessons.

Son Yooha was no exception. Originally, she was supposed to spend her vacation broadening her horizons in Europe, including England.

But she chose to go to Korea this summer vacation. The reason was simple. It was to see Kang Hyun.

"I was disappointed because we only met briefly in Brussels last time. This time, I plan to stay with him during the vacation."

"At times like this, it makes all the rumors about Phillips' Queen being as cold as ice seem like lies. You're a woman going off in search of love. By the way, Yooha, are you actually dating Hyun oppa?"

"Huh?"

Yooha couldn't easily answer her friend Michelle's question. She had been through a lot with Kang Hyun, but she couldn't definitively say they were dating. At that moment, Michelle squinted her eyes and added,

"Do you know how popular Hyun oppa is in America these days? If he ends up starring in a Hollywood movie, you'll have to compete with countless young fans in Europe and America. The most dangerous ones are the vixen-like Hollywood actresses."

It wasn't that Yooha didn't trust Kang Hyun, but how could she not be wary of the beautiful Hollywood actresses? Some of them had already appeared on famous American talk shows, declaring that the violinist Hyun was their ideal type.

"Yooha, you should just confess to him."

"Confess?"

"Yes, girls are more proactive these days."

Yooha's Adam's apple bobbed up and down significantly at Michelle's words.

The university pub was packed with students celebrating the end of the semester. It seemed like every student from the German Department of Korea University was there.

The atmosphere maker was undoubtedly Kim Dae-woo, who resembled a bear. His voice was so loud that the pub was filled with raucous laughter. At that moment,

Ding-ding.

With the sound of the pub's bell, the awaited person entered, and everyone cheered.

"Woohoo!"

"It's Kang Hyun sunbae!"

The freshmen, seeing Kang Hyun for the first time, were filled with admiration and awe. Kim Dae-woo's shoulders puffed up with pride, as if it were his own achievement.

"Everyone, let's toast to our pride of the German Department, Kang Hyun!"

With Kim Dae-woo's loud shout, the pub resonated with the clinking of beer glasses.

Kang Hyun had come upon Kim Dae-woo's invitation but hadn't expected so many students. He thought there would be no more than five people, but it seemed like the whole department had moved there.

"Today, there's no need to collect membership fees. I'll cover everything, so seniors and juniors, please drink to your heart's content!"

Another round of cheers erupted at Kang Hyun's generous offer. He spent time with his old friend Kim Dae-woo, losing track of time.

"But Dae-woo, aren't you going to the military? It's about time."

"Man, youth is short, so I'm delaying it as much as possible. And I've made up my mind. After graduation, I'll be your manager."

"Manager?"

It seemed Kim Dae-woo remembered a drunken confession Kang Hyun had made before. Kang Hyun thought that Kim Dae-woo would be a suitable manager.

With his bear-like physique and brains good enough to get him into Korea University, plus his sincerity, he seemed reliable.

Kang Hyun drank with both seniors and juniors. So many people wanted to clink glasses with him that he lost track of how much he drank. His vision was getting blurry, as if the film of his memory was being cut off.

"Then, Yooha, I'll take him."

"Yooha, are you sure you can do that?"

Yooha?

Kang Hyun squinted and looked to his side. The person he had longed to see was supporting him.

"I came to see you as soon as vacation started, and you're here drunk."

"Yooha?"

"Yes, I came straight from America to see you."

It felt like a dream, but as the taxi approached Ichon-dong, he realized it wasn't a dream.

"I wanted to surprise you, but you're so drunk you might not even recognize my face."

Feeling guilty at Yooha's complaints, Kang Hyun allowed her to support him as they walked towards Ichon-dong.

When he occasionally patted her head, he felt a warm presence. He wanted to fall asleep in Yooha's arms, but he couldn't. As they got off the taxi and walked together,

Suddenly, Yooha pushed Kang Hyun under a streetlight.

"Oppa, promise me."

"Promise?"

Under the dim streetlight, Yooha's face looked very red. She hesitated before firmly saying,

"Promise me that when I become an adult, you'll marry me immediately!"

What?

Without an engagement ceremony?

Before Kang Hyun could respond, Yooha's cherry-like lips covered his.
