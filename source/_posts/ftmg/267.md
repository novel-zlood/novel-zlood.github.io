“Chairman, we are currently pushing for the expansion of the LCD business unit and the mobile display business unit. We also plan to invest funds to reach into the biotechnology field, in addition to our existing electronics sector. Since the procedures related to the biotechnology field take some time domestically, we have expanded our business units to Russia and India. We have already taken legal measures for the reverse merger of Mozik and Jeil Trading.”

In the study of the grand mansion in Pyeongchang-dong, Chairman Wang and Son Ilsung were sitting facing each other.

Son Ilsung was reporting to Chairman Wang about Jeil Group's ten-year plan.

Jeil Group was moving faster than any other company. The group's motto was to keep moving forward without stopping at success.

Jeil Group was looking a hundred steps ahead while other conglomerates were looking ten steps ahead.

Of course, behind this was always the advice of Chairman Wang.

"Ilsung, it's good to move quickly to keep up with the changing times, but sometimes you need to stand still and check for mistakes. In addition to the business units expanded to Russia and India, now we need to find a way in China, where we have already paved the way. Also, push for the expansion of the strategic planning office, which serves as the brain of the company. At times like this, it's crucial to gather more talent. As for Kim Yongho from the textile division and Heo Seonggil from electronics, it might be good to replace them at the right time. They are capable, but the more talkative ones always end up causing trouble eventually."

"I will keep that in mind."

Son Ilsung struggled to hide his surprise. His father could see a thousand miles ahead even while seated.

He knew every little detail about the company. This managerial ability must have made him Korea's greatest giant.

Chairman Wang read through the report written by Son Ilsung for a long time.

Despite being father and son, Son Ilsung couldn't read Chairman Wang's expression at all. His poker face was famous even in the business world.

It was then that a faint smile appeared on Chairman Wang's previously unchanged face.

"I believe you will lead the group well in the future."

Son Ilsung widened his eyes. It was something he had never heard from his father before. Despite being over forty, his father always pointed out his mistakes as if dealing with a child.

Chairman Wang patted Son Ilsung's shoulder and stood up.

"The times are changing now."

Screeching noise―!

Though it was early morning, the Pyeongchang-dong mansion was filled with a savory smell, making it feel like a holiday.

In the kitchen, the housekeeper and Mother were bickering while preparing breakfast. The housekeeper, who had worked in the Pyeongchang-dong mansion for many years, pushed Mother out of the kitchen.

"Miss, please go and rest."

"Ma'am, I can still handle this much. I'm not even full yet."

"What if you get morning sickness? I'm really worried."

"I didn't have morning sickness when I was pregnant with Hyun. I'll be fine."

The housekeeper had taken care of the Pyeongchang-dong siblings in Mother's absence when they were young. Mother had a special affection for the housekeeper. At that moment, Kang Hyun came downstairs with a towel around his neck.

"What is this good smell?"

In the kitchen, there was japchae to complement the savory smell. When Kang Hyun tried to eat it with his hands, Mother was startled and waved her hands.

"Hey, use chopsticks."

Just then, Grandfather also came into the kitchen. Soon, a sumptuous breakfast was set on the table.

Even on regular days, Pyeongchang-dong had many side dishes, but after Mother became pregnant, the table looked as luxurious as a 12-course meal from Jeolla Province.

Then Grandfather asked, looking for his son-in-law who was not at the breakfast table.

"Hyunja, is Kang still sleeping?"

Father usually started his morning even earlier than Grandfather.

"No, Father."

"Then where did he go? He didn't even come to the breakfast table."

"Well…"

Mother hesitated for a moment, looking embarrassed, then explained.

"I said I wanted strawberries. He went to the early morning market about thirty minutes ago. I told him it was okay, but he left in such a hurry that I couldn't stop him."

"Hahaha. Hyunja, you really married well. Even though Kang seems stoic at work, he's quite the romantic."

Of course, Grandfather was not lacking in romance either. Whenever he missed Grandmother, he would make pumpkin pancakes and visit her grave.

How much time had passed? After breakfast, everyone was gathered in the living room.

"Honey, try some strawberries. These are from the greenhouse."

Even in the middle of summer, Father was so devoted that he went to the early morning market to get strawberries for Mother.

Father not only washed the strawberries but also carefully fed them to her. Mother's face still showed signs of embarrassment.

But Kang Hyun liked seeing his parents like this more than anything.

[The Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Kim Gapseong is inspecting stadiums for the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by Korea and Japan next year. Guus Hiddink, who led the Netherlands national team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup France, has been appointed as the head coach of the national team. We are looking forward to seeing what kind of legend our national team will write in the Korea-Japan World Cup next year.]

The morning news was reporting on the 2002 World Cup as the main story. Just then, Father, who was eating strawberries, spoke up.

"It's hard to believe that the World Cup is being held in our country, just like the 1988 Olympics."

"Kang, how far do you think our country will go? I think we might make it to the round of 16."

"Father-in-law, I hope our country makes it to the round of 16, but considering the objective FIFA rankings, there is a gap. If we make it to the round of 16, it will be a national celebration."

Most people were skeptical about the World Cup results. The prevailing opinion was that even making it to the round of 16 would be the end. Given the current level of the national team, even making it to the round of 16 would be a miracle according to experts.

"Then why don't we make a bet? Let's bet on how far our country will go, and whoever guesses correctly will get a wish granted. I say round of 16, and Kang thinks we won't make it to the round of 16."

Then Grandfather looked at Kang Hyun and asked.

"Hyun, what do you think?"

Kang Hyun smiled and looked at Guus Hiddink's face on the TV screen.

How could he forget? Even while he was preparing for the bar exam in his previous life, the excitement in Sillim-dong exam village during World Cup matches was unforgettable. Kang Hyun spoke with confidence.

"We will make it to the semifinals."

"Yooha, are you going to Korea this time?"

Students at prestigious Philips never rest during vacations. Most of them are heirs of prominent families in politics and business, busy with successor training.

Son Yooha was no exception. Originally, she should have spent her summer vacation broadening her horizons in Europe, including England.

But this summer vacation, she chose to go to Korea. The reason was simple. It was to see Kang Hyun.

"I was only able to meet him briefly in Brussels last time, so it was disappointing. This time, I want to be with him throughout the vacation."

"At times like this, the rumor that the queen of Philips is as cold as ice seems like a lie. You're a girl who travels for love. By the way, Yooha, are you dating Hyun oppa?"

"Huh?"

Yooha couldn't easily answer her friend Michelle's question. Although many things happened while she was with Kang Hyun, she couldn't definitely say they were dating. Then Michelle narrowed her eyes and added.

"These days, Hyun oppa is so popular in America. If he stars in a Hollywood movie, you'll have to compete with numerous fangirls in Europe as well. The most dangerous ones are the fox-like Hollywood actresses."

It wasn't that Yooha didn't trust Kang Hyun, but Hollywood actresses were undeniably beautiful. Many of them had even appeared on famous American talk shows declaring Hyun, the violinist, as their ideal type.

"Yooha, you should confess."

"Confess?"

"Yes, these days, girls are more proactive."

Yooha's throat bobbed noticeably at Michelle's words.

The university pub was packed with students celebrating the end of the semester. It seemed like every single student from the German language department of Korea University was present.

The mood-maker was undoubtedly Kim Daewoo, who resembled a bear. His loud voice filled the pub with raucous laughter. Then it happened.

Ding.

As the pub's doorbell rang and the awaited person entered, a cheer erupted from everyone.

"Wow!"

"It's Kang Hyun sunbae!"

The eyes of the freshmen meeting Kang Hyun for the first time were filled with admiration and reverence. Kim Daewoo's shoulders rose with pride as if it were his own achievement.

"Everyone, let's toast to Kang Hyun, the pride of our German language department!"

With Kim Daewoo's toast, the pub was filled with the sound of clinking beer glasses.

Kang Hyun had come at Kim Daewoo's call, but he hadn't expected so many students to be there. He had thought there would be no more than five people, but it felt like the entire department had been moved.

"Today, I will cover all the expenses, so seniors and juniors, please drink to your heart's content without worry!"

Another cheer erupted at Kang Hyun's generous offer. Kang Hyun lost track of time as he drank with his old friend Kim Daewoo.

"But Daewoo, aren't you going to the army? You should go soon."

"Man, youth is short; I'll delay the army as much as possible. And I've made up my mind. After graduation, I'll be your manager."

"Manager?"

It seemed Kim Daewoo remembered what Kang Hyun had said in a drunken confession before. Kang Hyun thought Kim Daewoo would make a good manager.

With his bear-like physique, he was reliable. Plus, getting into Korea University meant he was smart, and above all, he was sincere.

Kang Hyun drank with both seniors and juniors alike. So many people wanted to clink glasses with him that he lost track of how much he had drunk. His vision was blurring as if the film had cut.

"Then Yooha, I'll take Hyun oppa with me."

"Yooha, can you really do that?"

Yooha?

Kang Hyun squinted and looked beside him. The person he had missed so much was supporting him.

"I came to see you right after the vacation started, and here you are, drunk."

"Yooha?"

"Yes, I came straight from America to see you."

It felt like a dream, but as the taxi approached Pyeongchang-dong, he realized it wasn't.

"I wanted to surprise you, but you're drunk like this. Will you even recognize my face?"

Feeling guilty at Yooha's complaint, Kang Hyun headed to Pyeongchang-dong with her.

As he occasionally patted her head, he felt a warm sensation. He wanted to fall asleep in Yooha's arms, but he couldn't. As they got out of the taxi and walked, Yooha suddenly pushed him under a streetlight.

"Oppa, promise me."

"Promise?"

Under the dim streetlight, Yooha's face looked very red. She hesitated for a moment and then shouted with determination.

"Promise to marry me as soon as I become an adult!"

What?

Without even an engagement?
