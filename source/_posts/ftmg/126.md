Sizzle―!

The grand mansion in Pyeongchang-dong is bustling. The sound of grilling meat and the savory smell of various pancakes frying could easily make one mistake it for a holiday.

The reason was simple. Today was none other than Chairman Wang's birthday, and it was no exaggeration to say that all the prominent members of the Jeil Group had gathered.

They had enough people to form a soccer team. Chairman Wang had three sons and two daughters, and there were already enough grandchildren to count on ten fingers.

"Father, happy birthday―!"

"Grandfather, happy birthday!"

Following the eldest son, Son Ilsung's words, the voices of the second and third sons and daughters, and the grandchildren followed suit as if in unison. Among them was the third son, Son Hongwon, who had been estranged from Chairman Wang.

Son Hongwon looked uneasy, as if he was worried that Chairman Wang might scold him, making him look like a child who needed to use the bathroom.

"Yes, thank you. Everyone, raise your glasses."

On such a joyous day, he couldn't possibly get angry. On the otherwise silent dining table, only the feast shone brightly.

Just as the rice bowls were about to be emptied, someone who couldn't stand the atmosphere any longer spoke up first.

"Unnie, is Yooha still in the US?"

"No, she should be in London by now."

"London? Why did she go there? On a day like today, it would’ve been great if she came to Korea to celebrate Grandfather's birthday. She's usually so perceptive, but she always misses important days like this. Our Kyungwon woke up in the middle of his sleep just because it was Grandfather's birthday. Ilsung oppa needs to scold Yooha a bit. If she keeps staying abroad, she'll get spoiled."

Chairman Wang's youngest daughter, who was in charge of the department store, joked around.

While some siblings feared Son Ilsung, others, like the youngest daughter, did not. Chairman Wang had spoiled her since she was young, so she sometimes lacked discernment in such matters.

"Yooha visited Korea a week ago. I called her in advance because I thought I wouldn't be able to have a proper conversation with her today due to the crowd."

"What?"

"I'm done eating, so you all can continue talking among yourselves."

As Chairman Wang got up from his seat, his children hesitated, knowing well why they had come to Pyeongchang-dong. Their intention was clear: to make a good impression on Chairman Wang for future inheritance matters.

"Father-in-law, I brought some Pu'er tea."

It was when Chairman Wang was resting in the study. Im Hyera knocked on the door, holding a tray with a teapot and cups. It seemed she knew exactly what he wanted to cleanse his palate. Indeed, she was the daughter-in-law who understood Chairman Wang the best.

"How's the atmosphere outside?"

"Most are busy watching Ilsung's reactions. The third son seemed relieved that you didn't scold him. I was also worried that you might get angry."

"Do you think I'm like Chairman Yoo who would hit the third son's forehead with a spoon? The hierarchy among them should now be managed by Ilsung, not me. Look at the youngest, she still thinks she got the department store because of her exceptional skills and acts recklessly."

Today was more for Son Ilsung than Chairman Wang. The usually tiger-like Chairman Wang had stepped aside first for this reason.

"Who do you think will bear the future of Jeil Group?"

"Objectively, among the sons and daughters, Ilsung is the most outstanding."

"Then who do you think will take over next?"

It was a difficult question to answer. Chairman Wang had more than ten grandchildren. Among them, Son Yooha was said to be the most outstanding, but she was still very young.

Seeing Im Hyera deep in thought, Chairman Wang smiled pleasantly. He had chosen his daughter-in-law well. He would not give extra points just because Yooha was a girl.

"That's enough. By the way, you brewed the tea perfectly."

Time passed, and the teacup was almost empty.

"By the way, Father-in-law, what were you looking at earlier?"

Im Hyera looked curiously at the thick album on the desk. She had been curious since she brought the tea.

Seeing Im Hyera's curious expression, Chairman Wang smiled mischievously, as carefree as the children in the photos.

"What else, it's my only hobby."

-The conductor's hand is heavy.

These were the words I heard when I first received the baton from Maestro Spencer. It was meant to instill a sense of responsibility, as the orchestra's sound and the interpretation of the piece are recreated through the conductor's hand.

Even a simple 4/4 beat, when performed by a large orchestra, follows the conductor's lead and comes to life.

-Remember that a dead piece must be revived through your hands.

In layman's terms, a conductor is said to reinterpret the notes of the dead. They recreate the symphonies left by composers who died hundreds to tens of years ago and bring them to life through melody.

"Hyun, did I ever tell you about when I first learned to conduct?"

"What about it?"

"For about three years, I was responsible for binding and copying the orchestra members' scores. I had to know what each member did, what tone the trombone produced, and what scores each instrument used. It was only after three years that I first held a practice baton."

I couldn't believe that even Maestro Spencer had such days. Wasn't he the Maestro who could command countless members with a single gesture?

When I saw his charismatic eyes on the podium, everyone held their breath. No wonder he was called the heart of the London Symphony.

"Looking back on those days, I have many thoughts about you, Hyun. You were an exceptional violinist, and you show incredible talent as a conductor. Being able to lead without losing your sense amidst the resonance of numerous instruments is a great blessing."

"It's thanks to your excellent teaching, Maestro."

"Don't try to wrap your talent and effort in the word 'humility.' Look at your right hand."

Looking at my palm, I saw that the grip where I held the baton was already calloused, with blisters forming. It looked like I had marched with my hands.

Over the past week, Maestro Spencer had sincerely taught me conducting. From the basics to his experienced know-how.

As a student, it was my duty to give my all.

"A guest conductor is like a wanderer searching for an oasis. They face many difficulties outside of conducting, as they have to adapt to a different orchestra each time. That's why everyone aspires to become a permanent conductor with their own orchestra. However, to become a permanent conductor of a world-renowned orchestra, you have to go through many hurdles. I'm curious to see where you will decide to go in the end, Hyun."

What an intense gaze.

My senior once gave me a similar look when I finished my internship at the law firm. He had strongly recommended that I join his law firm after graduating from the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

Of course, my senior's gaze back then couldn't compare to this. After all, this was the world's greatest Maestro.

At that moment,

"Maestro, I've brought some late-night snacks."

"Snacks?"

It was out of the blue, but the voice of Dmitri, the concertmaster, came from beyond the practice room. The word "snacks" had become familiar to the members.

Dmitri and the other members had all come to the practice room. They were probably here because I would soon be leaving for Germany.

Principal cellist Emmanuel was even holding a cake.

"Hyun, there's something you must do in Germany."

"What is it, Emmanuel?"

"Show them what a prospective member of the London Symphony is like. Make sure to bring down the noses of those Berlin Phil guys and come back―!"

I barely held back a laugh.

I had forgotten how fierce the competition was among the world's leading orchestras. It wasn't just Emmanuel. The other members also had similar expressions.

They looked at me as if I were family. Everyone was cheering me on with clenched fists as I prepared to head to Berlin. It looked like I was going for a showdown.

August in Germany is like spring in Korea.

"Hyun, we've arrived."

I looked out the window, wearing only a light cardigan. The Berlin Philharmonic Concert Hall had a unique exterior and interior.

The interior was as synesthetic as the exterior, which was designed from multiple angles. It was so sophisticated that it was hard to believe it was built decades ago.

Moreover, the interior of the concert hall was designed like a vineyard on a hillside, with seats arranged at various levels and angles. The farthest seat from the center stage was only about 30 meters away.

"There are more people than I expected."

"I found out that today is a rehearsal day for the Berlin Philharmonic."

"A rehearsal?"

I had arrived in Berlin two days earlier than planned after parting ways with Yooha at the airport. With some time to spare, I decided to explore the exterior of the concert hall, and it turned out to be a lucky day.

"Can the general public watch the rehearsal?"

"There are days when it's open to the public, but today it's for the academy students."

"Unfortunately, we can't watch it directly. Krissy, please wait in the car for a moment. I'll take a look around the exterior of the concert hall."

I didn't go to see Maestro Yuri immediately. Arriving earlier than scheduled is considered rude in the West.

As I was briefly looking around the exterior of the concert hall,

"Hyun―!"

An elderly staff member with white hair called my name. I thought I had misheard and continued walking, but I heard my name clearly again.

"Hyun?"

"The name is correct, but..."

"Hurry up. You can't take so long in the bathroom―!"

Before I could refuse, the old man grabbed my hand and led me inside the concert hall.

The old man personally checked the seats and seated me. The people sitting next to me looked at me curiously.

At that moment,

"Everyone, please focus―!"

As the casually dressed members took the stage, the previously noisy hall instantly became silent. The eyes of the academy students were more serious than ever.

It was no wonder, as it was the Berlin Phil. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that all these students dreamed of joining the Berlin Phil.

'The Maestro isn't here yet.'

Not all rehearsals require the Maestro's presence.

Sometimes the concertmaster takes on that role, and today's rehearsal was probably to showcase the individual skills of the academy students.

The man who seemed to be the concertmaster gave the signal, and the rehearsal began.

'Impressive.'

A different kind of admiration came over me compared to the London Symphony. The concertmaster's ability was beyond words.

The concertmaster of the Berlin Phil had both conducting and performance skills, unlike Dimitri of the London Symphony, who excelled more as a performer. The concertmaster even had a similarly cold appearance.

"If anyone has any questions, please raise your hand now."

During a break after the second movement, the concertmaster addressed the audience, but there was no response.

The academy students seemed frozen by the concertmaster's charisma. It was no wonder, as the rehearsal had been flawless in their eyes.

"May I ask a question?"

At that moment, Hyun slowly raised his hand.

"That's fine. What's your name?"

"I'm Hyun."

The concertmaster, Samuel, narrowed his eyes at the name that seemed oddly familiar, as Hyun looked incredibly young for an academy student.

* * *

Meanwhile,

"I need to go in."

"I'm sorry, but the rehearsal has already started, so you can't enter."

Choi Hyun, a 27-year-old academy student from Shanghai, China, was arguing with another staff member at the entrance of the concert hall.
