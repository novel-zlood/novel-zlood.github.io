The orchestra members move in perfect harmony at the fingertips of the young conductor. The movement unfolds breathlessly as if a storm is blowing in, but the conductor's eyes remain calm.

Yet, the sharpness that glimmers within those calm eyes keeps the members on edge.

'Alberto―!'

If anyone loosened their tension even a little, the conductor's sharp gaze would follow immediately. A cold sweat trickled down the forehead of Alberto, in charge of the cello, under the silent warning.

The young conductor did not tolerate even a moment of carelessness. The members had to finish their performance under the conductor's perfect and precise direction.

Perhaps that's why the conductor's nickname was Iron Blood.

"As expected, the assistant conductor's rehearsal is amazing."

"Alberto, that's why I told you not to get distracted during rehearsal."

"I was just thinking about something else for a moment. Who would have thought he'd notice right away? It's like he's a ghost."

The members trusted the assistant conductor. Ever since he joined the orchestra, the members' skills had significantly improved. The perfect and rigorous practice always brought results.

"But has anyone ever seen the assistant conductor smile?"

No one could answer someone's question. It had already been half a year since they started working with the assistant conductor, but no one had ever seen him smile.

No wonder he was nicknamed Iron Blood. Some members even thought he was a robot born to conduct. His eyes and mouth were always calm and sharp. At that moment.

"I have."

Mikel, known as the orchestra's troublemaker, tilted his head and said. Mikel elaborated as he felt the attention of the members.

"I just saw it on my way back from the restroom. He was smiling while reading a newspaper from Korea."

"A newspaper from Korea?"

"It was a newspaper with Maestro Karas's face prominently on the front page."

The members' eyes lit up at the mention of Karas. Indeed, the Empress Karas was a great maestro who had a significant influence on orchestras worldwide.

[Empress Karas Praises Violinist Hyun!]

The assistant conductor of the orchestra, Baek Junghoon, was smiling as he looked at the newspaper from his homeland. It was a ray of light in his difficult life abroad. How amazing it was to move the legendary maestro.

Baek Junghoon, known as the Iron Blood Maestro, smiled and made a resolution. He would stand shoulder to shoulder with Hyun.

* * *

The sound of the plane taking off reverberated like hitting a drum with sticks. Somehow, I ended up taking a Russian airline to the UK.

Perhaps it was because I was traveling with the maestro. The flight attendants' faces were filled with both excitement and tension.

Of course, anyone with even a slight interest in classical music would know the name of Maestro Karas.

"I'll pass on the wine. Please prepare a Western meal for me, and sorry, but do you have any Gramophone magazines or anything related to classical music?"

As fluent Russian flowed from my mouth, not only the flight attendants but also the maestro looked surprised.

"Hyun, how many languages do you speak?"

"Just enough to get by in three or four languages."

"Just three or four?"

The maestro clicked his tongue.

Could it be thanks to the memories of my past life and developed software? My language skills were as unparalleled as my musical talents. I modestly said three or four, but it was certainly more than that.

'Anna?'

As before, Anna with platinum blonde hair adorned the airline pamphlet.

Her emerald-like eyes, soft platinum blonde hair, and white slender fingers playing the violin. The world was indeed unfair.

So pretty and full of musical talent, and even the daughter of the airline owner's family.

"Hyun, is she someone you know?"

"Yes, Maestro. She's a friend."

At that moment, Karas's eyes narrowed. It felt like he was silently telling me not to get distracted from Yooha.

How much time had passed? The plane, which had been flying through the sky, had already arrived in London by the time night turned to day.

The cool British wind, filled with the scent of rain, pierced my lungs. As I stepped out of the departure gate, I saw a huge crowd.

At first, I thought a celebrity had arrived, but all those camera flashes were aimed at us.

At that moment.

"Maestro―!"

Accompanied by bodyguards, Spencer and the members appeared like saviors.

* * *

"The Royal Academy of Music?"

Spencer gave a short nod.

"I don't think it's a bad idea."

"You mean studying at a university in London?"

"Yes, even though you are resuming your career as a violinist, it's not like you have performances all the time. Spending time with other geniuses your age would be a good way to expand your musical worldview."

Spencer then nodded.

"But the Royal Academy of Music doesn't usually accept exchange students. I, too, am a graduate of the Royal Academy of Music, but I've never heard of them accepting exchange students."

Indeed, isn't it a globally renowned music school? Only the crème de la crème among geniuses get admitted, and not all of them graduate.

Even until the 1990s, the Queen of Buckingham herself was the principal. There's no need to say more. At that moment.

"But for a musician with a career like yours, it's a different story. You should be able to pass the entrance exam without difficulty. I'll write the recommendation letter myself. Besides, I know the current principal of the Royal Academy very well, so there shouldn't be any problems."

To think he would offer to write the recommendation letter personally.

"I'm sorry for always receiving your help, Maestro."

"There's no need to put up such barriers between teacher and student. By the way, do you still hear from Yuri in Berlin these days?"

Spencer seemed worried that the Berlin Phil might still be trying to recruit me.

When I shook my head, a slight smile appeared on his lips. Spencer had a faint smile as he looked at the old TV screen.

"I first heard you play through that old TV screen in the conductor's room. I still vividly remember the sight of a very young child standing on stage playing the violin. It felt like my lifelong musical values were being shaken. I thought all prodigies died after Mozart, but meeting you shattered my beliefs."

"You're too kind, Maestro."

"If you keep being so modest, many musicians will point fingers at you. Not only did you conquer the Queen Elisabeth Competition at such a young age, but you also conducted for the British Royal Family. There might be no one in the 20th century who has a career comparable to yours. Even Maestro Karas did not conduct for the royal family at such a young age."

Spencer muttered to himself, "Maybe Mozart." He then looked at the violin case in the corner of the conductor's room and asked.

"How about it? Could you play for me after a long time?"

* * *

There was still time until Empress Karas's comeback stage. The members of the London Symphony Orchestra practiced their instruments day in and day out for the Empress's comeback stage. Watching the rehearsals, they couldn't help but be amazed by the Empress's conducting and leadership.

The experienced members of the London Symphony Orchestra couldn't keep up with the Empress's pace, so she had to slow down. A legend is a legend. The audience would surely welcome the legend on her comeback stage.

"We've arrived."

At the taxi driver's words, I looked out the window.

"The Royal Academy of Music."

We had arrived before I knew it. Founded by Prince Edward VII in 1882, the Royal Academy of Music had a distinctly antique exterior.

It felt different from Juilliard, which I visited earlier. As the autumn breeze blew through the window, a gentle melody could be heard, and every student was carrying an instrument case.

"HYUN?"

A school official who I had contacted in advance came out to greet me. Like Kim Mihyun, he seemed young, but his rimless glasses and attire gave him a sense of weight.

Moreover, he seemed to hold a high position at the school. Every passing student bowed their heads.

Soon, the students' gazes followed me. Their stares were so intense that I felt like no student wasn't looking at me.

"The principal is waiting for you, please come in."

I didn't expect to meet the principal directly. But then again, it was a recommendation letter from the chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. Swallowing my nerves, I entered the principal's office.

"Long time no see, Hyun."

Long time no see?

At that moment, a familiar figure came into view.

'Prince Samuel?'

Samuel greeted me with a hug. Only then did I understand. After the Queen stepped down as principal, the new person in charge was the prince.

After greeting each other, we sat down face to face. Samuel even poured strong tea into my cup himself.

"I never imagined that the young gentleman I met then would grow up so quickly."

I remembered. My first meeting with Samuel was in Sillim-dong, wasn't it? It was in Sillim-dong, where I went to organize my past life's memories, that I had an unexpected encounter.

In a way, fate was truly mysterious. Who would have thought that I would meet the Prince of England after eating stir-fried pork and sundae in Sillim-dong? Even the most famous fortune-teller probably couldn't have predicted this future.

"Spencer threatened me. He said not admitting you would be a disservice to the Royal Academy of Music's reputation. Really, Spencer must have forgotten. The first fan of Hyun is none other than me. I was the one who introduced you to Spencer, after all. Hahaha."

The meeting with the principal turned into a casual chat. We were already reminiscing about the past, beyond the formalities of being the principal of the Royal Academy of Music and an undergraduate student.

Samuel said, "Talking with you, Hyun, is always enjoyable. I feel like I'm talking to someone my age, both then and now." He sipped his tea and looked at me.

"Do you know? The Royal Academy of Music is buzzing with excitement at the news that you want to come as an exchange student."

"Really? But not to that extent..."

"It's true. The winner of the Queen Elisabeth Competition and a conductor who performed for the British Royal Family is coming to our school as an undergraduate. In fact, the professors are even more excited than the students. There's even a rumor that you're a joint student of Spencer and Maestro Karas. When you attend the Royal Academy, you'll surely receive even more attention. It's certain."
