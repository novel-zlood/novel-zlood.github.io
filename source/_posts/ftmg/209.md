The orchestra members moved in perfect harmony under the young conductor's fingertips. Despite the breathless pace of the movement unfolding like a storm, the conductor's eyes remained calm and composed.

Rather, the sharpness that shone through those calm eyes made the orchestra members tense up.

"Alberto―!"

The moment anyone lost their focus, the conductor's sharp gaze would immediately follow. Under the silent warning, a bead of cold sweat trickled down Alberto's forehead as he played the cello.

The young conductor did not tolerate even a moment of carelessness. The members had to finish their performance under the conductor's perfectly measured guidance.

Perhaps that's why the conductor's nickname was Iron-Blood.

"As expected, the assistant conductor's rehearsal is amazing."

"Alberto, that's why I told you not to daydream during rehearsal!"

"I just got lost in thought for a moment, who would've thought he'd notice right away? He's like a ghost."

The orchestra members trusted the assistant conductor. Since he joined the orchestra, the members' skills had collectively improved. The rigorous and perfect practice always yielded results.

"But has anyone ever seen the assistant conductor smile?"

No one answered the question. It had already been half a year since they started working with the assistant conductor, but no one had ever seen him smile.

No wonder he earned the nickname Iron-Blood. Some members even thought he was a robot born to conduct. His eyes and mouth were always calm and sharp. Then it happened.

"I saw him smile."

Mikel, known as the troublemaker of the orchestra, tilted his head and spoke. Sensing the attention of the members, Mikel elaborated.

"I saw him while I was coming back from the restroom earlier. He was smiling while reading a newspaper from Korea."

"A newspaper from Korea?"

"It had a huge picture of Maestro Karas on the front page."

The members' eyes lit up at the mention of Karas. No wonder, as Empress Karas had a significant impact on orchestras worldwide.

[Empress Karas Praises Violinist Hyun!]

Assistant Conductor Baek Jeonghoon was smiling as he looked at the newspaper from his homeland. It was news of Hyun, a ray of light in his tough life abroad. Isn't it amazing to have moved the legendary maestro?

Baek Jeonghoon, known as the Iron-Blood Maestro, smiled and renewed his resolve. He too would stand shoulder to shoulder with Hyun.

The sound of the plane taking off echoed in my ears like the sound of hitting a drum with a stick. Somehow, I ended up choosing a Russian airline for my trip to the UK.

Was it because I was traveling with the maestro? The flight attendants' faces showed both excitement and tension.

Naturally, anyone with even a slight interest in classical music would know the name Maestro Karas.

"No wine, please. Prepare the meal in Western style, and if possible, could you provide a gramophone or a magazine related to classical music?"

When I spoke in fluent Russian, both the flight attendant and the maestro looked surprised.

"Hyun, how many languages can you speak?"

"Just enough to get by in three or four languages."

"Just three or four?"

The maestro clicked his tongue.

Perhaps it was thanks to my past life experiences and developed software. In terms of language skills, I was as unparalleled as my musical talent. I modestly said three or four, but in reality, it was definitely more.

'Anna?'

The airline pamphlet was once again adorned with the platinum blonde Anna.

With emerald-tinted eyes and light platinum blonde hair, she played the violin with her thin, fair fingers. No matter how you looked at it, the world was unfair.

She was not only beautiful and musically gifted, but also the daughter of the airline's owner.

"Hyun, do you know her?"

"Yes, maestro. She's a friend."

At that moment, Karas's eyes narrowed. It felt as if she was silently warning me not to take my eyes off Yooha.

How much time had passed? The plane, slicing through the sky, arrived in London as night turned into day again.

The cool British wind, filled with the scent of rain, pierced my lungs, symbolizing the October weather. Stepping out of the departure gate, I saw a crowd of people.

At first, I thought a celebrity had arrived, but then I realized all those camera flashes were directed at us.

It was then.

"Maestro―!"

Spencer and the orchestra members appeared like saviors with security guards.

* * *

"Royal Academy of Music?"

Spencer nodded briefly.

"I don't think it's a bad idea."

"Are you talking about studying in London?"

"Yes, Hyun. Even if you are restarting your career as a violinist, there won't always be performances. Spending time with peers your age could broaden your musical perspective more than gaining experience and skills in the field."

But Spencer soon nodded again.

"But the Royal Academy of Music doesn't usually accept exchange students. I, too, graduated from the Royal Academy of Music, but I've never heard of them accepting exchange students."

No wonder, as it's a world-renowned music school. Only the best among geniuses get admitted, and even then, not all graduate.

Moreover, until the 1990s, the Queen of Buckingham herself was the head of the school. It's needless to say more. It was then.

"But for a musician with your career, Hyun, it's a different story. The entrance exam wouldn't be hard for you, and I'll write you a recommendation letter myself. Besides, the current head of the Royal Academy of Music is someone I know very well, so there's nothing to worry about."

I didn't expect him to offer to write a recommendation letter himself.

"I always feel like I'm just receiving help from you, maestro."

"What good is it to put up walls between a mentor and a student? By the way, have you been in touch with Yuri from Berlin lately?"

Spencer seemed worried that Berlin Philharmonic might still be trying to recruit me.

When I shook my head, his lips curled up slightly. Spencer, with a faint smile, turned his gaze to the old TV set.

"I first heard you play, Hyun, through that TV set in the conductor's room. The image of a very young child playing the violin on stage is still vivid in my mind. It felt like my lifelong musical values were being shaken. I thought all prodigies after Mozart were dead, but meeting you in person shattered those values."

"You're too kind, maestro."

"If you keep being modest like that, many musicians will point fingers at you. Not only did you conquer the Queen Elisabeth Competition at a young age, but you also conducted for the British Royal Family. I doubt anyone in the 20th century has a career comparable to yours. Even Maestro Karas didn't conduct for the Royal Family at such a young age."

Spencer added to himself, "Maybe Mozart would be an exception." Then the maestro looked at the violin case placed in the corner of the conductor's room and asked.

"How about it? Can you play me your melody after a long time?"

* * *

There was still time before Empress Karas's comeback stage. The members of the London Symphony Orchestra practiced every day for the Empress's return. Every time we attended a rehearsal, we couldn't hide our amazement at her conducting and leadership.

Even the experienced members of the London Symphony Orchestra couldn't keep up with her pace, so the Empress had to slow down. A legend was indeed a legend. On the day of her comeback, the audience would surely be welcoming the legend back.

"We've arrived."

At the taxi driver's words, I looked up and gazed out of the window.

"The Royal Academy of Music."

Before I knew it, we had arrived. Founded in 1882 by Prince Edward VII, the Royal Academy of Music had a distinguished and elegant exterior.

It felt different from Juilliard, which I had visited before. A gentle melody filled the air along with the autumn breeze by the window, and every student seemed to be carrying an instrument case.

"HYUN?"

A school official who I had contacted in advance came out to greet me. Like Kim Mihyun, she appeared young but her rimless glasses and attire gave an air of authority.

She seemed to hold a fairly high position in the school, judging by how every passing student bowed to her.

Soon, the students' gazes followed me. The stares were so intense that it felt like every student was looking at me.

"The president is waiting for you. Please come in."

I never imagined I would meet the president directly. Of course, it was a recommendation letter from the chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. Swallowing my nervousness, I entered the president's office.

"It's been a long time, Hyun."

A long time?

At that moment, a familiar figure came into view.

'Prince Samuel?'

Samuel warmly hugged me as if he was genuinely pleased. Only then did I understand. The person who took over the school after the queen stepped down was Prince Samuel.

After exchanging greetings, we sat down facing each other. Samuel even poured rich black tea into a cup for me.

"I never imagined that the young gentleman from back then would grow up so quickly."

Come to think of it, my first meeting with Samuel was in Sillim-dong. It was an unexpected encounter while I was trying to organize the memories of my past life in Sillim-dong.

In hindsight, fate was truly mysterious. Who would've thought that after eating stir-fried pork and sundae in Sillim-dong, I would meet the prince of England? Even the most renowned fortune-tellers couldn't have predicted this future.

"Spencer gave me an ultimatum. He said not accepting Hyun right away would tarnish the reputation of the Royal Academy of Music. Honestly, I think Spencer forgot something. I'm Hyun's very first fan. After all, I'm the one who introduced Hyun to Spencer. Hahaha."

The meeting with the president turned out to be more of a personal chat. We reminisced about the past, shedding the formal titles of the president of the Royal Academy of Music and a student.

Samuel, while conversing with me, added, "Talking with you, Hyun, is still delightful. It feels like I'm conversing with someone my age, both then and now." Samuel sipped his tea and looked at me.

"Did you know? The Royal Academy of Music is abuzz with excitement at the news of you wanting to come as an exchange student."

"Really? I didn't think it would be that big of a deal."

"It's true. The winner of the Queen Elisabeth Competition and a conductor for the British Royal Family is joining the school as a student. Actually, it seems like the professors are more excited than the students. There's even a rumor that you're a joint student of Spencer and Maestro Karas. When you start attending the Royal Academy of Music, you'll undoubtedly receive a lot of attention. It's certain."

I felt like a stormy transfer student.
