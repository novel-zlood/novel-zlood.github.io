‘Do they know each other?’

Director Jim Filmer looked at Kang Hyun and Cotton alternately with a puzzled expression.

He had already heard that his niece Misha’s fiancé would be attending the garden party together. According to Misha, he was a renowned prodigy and young entrepreneur in the IT field.

“CEO Kang?”

“CEO?”

But then Cotton called Kang Hyun ‘CEO.’ Cotton, noticing Misha’s glance, quickly turned to greet Director Jim Filmer.

“I’m Cotton, Misha’s fiancé. Nice to meet you, Director.”

“I’ve heard a lot about you from our Misha. But do you know Hyun?”

At that moment, Kang Hyun signaled Cotton with his eyes. There was no need to unnecessarily reveal to Director Jim Filmer that he was the CEO of VH Company.

However, Cotton, who wasn’t so adept at social nuances, completely misinterpreted Kang Hyun’s signal.

“We know each other very well. CEO Kang is one of the most outstanding geniuses I’ve ever met. I never imagined I’d see him again here today. After our last investment contract, I was dying to talk to him again. I still can’t believe how knowledgeable he is about portable nanochips!”

Oh my God.

Cotton's face was already flushed as if he had taken a straight shot of whiskey. His passion for nanochips was unrivaled.

On the other hand, Director Jim Filmer still seemed to have no idea what Cotton was talking about. At that moment.

“Cotton, are you saying that the genius CEO you mentioned before is this violinist Hyun?”

“Violinist Hyun? Misha, what are you talking about? This man is the CEO of VH Company.”

“No, he’s the violinist I’ve been raving about. The musician who’s currently taking Hollywood by storm!”

Kang Hyun felt a headache coming on. Cotton and Misha were engaging in a comedic dialogue like Dumb and Dumber.

The main topic of conversation was Kang Hyun. Cotton, who was clueless about classical music, thought Hyun was a genius in the field of nanochips, while Misha was busy explaining his fame as a violinist.

Receiving such high praise right in front of him felt incredibly embarrassing. Director Jim Filmer looked at Kang Hyun with a peculiar expression, as if he were an alien.

“CEO, what do you think about the expansion potential of the nanochip field?”

Kang Hyun had been conversing with Cotton for thirty minutes. Cotton was as lively as a fish in water.

Kang Hyun was merely sharing snippets of knowledge he had acquired in his past life, but Cotton treated him like a legendary genius.

Director Jim Filmer also intermittently asked Kang Hyun questions.

“Hyun, I knew you were a genius who scored perfect on the Korean SAT, but I didn’t realize you were this exceptional. To think you could impress a prodigy recognized by MIT!”

“Uncle, you have no idea how much Cotton talks about Mr. Hyun. He usually has no interest in others, but ever since meeting the CEO, his eyes have changed. I even thought the CEO might be an incredibly beautiful woman when he first mentioned him.”

“Hyun, why don’t you tell us more about your first meeting with Cotton? I’m really curious.”

With Director Jim Filmer’s urging, the attention of the garden party suddenly focused on them. As Kang Hyun hesitated, Cotton began.

Cotton was a renowned prodigy at MIT, never having met anyone who could refute his theories. His mentor even considered him a partner rather than a student.

But it was Kang Hyun who directly challenged his theory on facility nanochips.

Gulp.

Kang Hyun thought Cotton was quite eloquent.

Before long, the garden party attendees were so engrossed in Cotton’s story that they forgot to sip their drinks. Director Jim Filmer’s eyes were especially bright.

Exaggerating a bit, it seemed like he was ready to write a screenplay based on Kang Hyun and Cotton’s story.

“Hyun, do you have a girlfriend?”

Suddenly, Director Jim Filmer asked Kang Hyun. He looked at him puzzled, wondering what the question was about.

“If not, how about one of my nieces? You have a lot of fans among them. Some more nieces will be coming from Beverly soon, and they are also your fervent fans. Not to brag, but my family is quite good-looking. Some of my nieces are even models!”

Perhaps that’s why. The women at the garden party were all looking at Kang Hyun with intense gazes. Director Jim Filmer also seemed quite eager. But from somewhere, Kang Hyun felt Yooha’s gaze on him. Was it just his imagination?

“Manager Kim, your skills have really deteriorated.”

Manager Kim Sang-guk’s swing sent the golf ball into a bunker. Chairman Wang laughed heartily watching this.

Just a few months ago, his swing wasn’t this bad, but at this rate, he was surely heading for a triple bogey.

“I’m sorry, Chairman.”

“There’s nothing to be sorry about. Thanks to you, I’ll be treated to a delicious lunch today. It seems you’ve been too busy to play golf while on your overseas business trip?”

“Yes, I’ve been busy with frequent meetings.”

Manager Kim Sang-guk had been traveling all over the world on Kang Hyun’s orders for the past six months. Starting from nearby China to India, Europe, and even the United States. It was practically a world tour.

Chairman Wang took the golf club from the caddie and asked.

“Manager Kim, what do you think about the potential of VH Company?”

“Pardon?”

“I’m also a shareholder of VH Company. I should know how the investment company is doing, shouldn’t I?”

Manager Kim Sang-guk was practically the acting head of VH Company in Korea.

Chairman Wang was curious about how much VH Company had grown over the years, given Manager Kim’s efforts to expand the company’s presence in Korea.

Manager Kim paused for a moment before speaking.

“So far, the actual results are limited to the investment in an Austrian pharmaceutical company and some technical support investments. To be honest, the returns have been minimal compared to the investments. The CEO is involved in so many projects.”

“Are you talking about Hyun?”

“Yes, as soon as there are investment returns, the funds are reinvested into other projects.”

Manager Kim did not elaborate. He didn’t mention that Kang Hyun was investing in numerous talents worldwide through VH Company.

But Chairman Wang likely already knew, even without being told. At that moment, he looked at Manager Kim with a peculiar gaze.

“Manager Kim, when I appointed you head of the strategic planning office in the past, you were very clear about differentiating between public and private matters. You were the only one who dared to oppose my opinions.”

“At that time, I didn’t have enough experience to understand your deep intentions.”

“No, you were an outstanding talent even then. The results proved it. That’s why I appointed you head of the strategic planning office without hesitation. Frankly, I didn’t expect you to work at VH Company for so long. I thought you would return to the strategic planning office after a short stint.”

After all, the reputation and scale of VH Company and the strategic planning office of the Daeil Group were worlds apart. But Manager Kim replied without hesitation.

“I’ve staked my future on VH Company.”

“Is it that significant?”

“Yes, traveling the world for the past six months has only strengthened my conviction. Once VH Company rises to the surface, the world will be astonished. And at the center will be CEO Kang Hyun.”

Chairman Wang smiled with satisfaction at Manager Kim’s resolute expression. It seemed he had chosen the right grandson-in-law.

A strange rumor was circulating in Hollywood. It was about a musician who had captivated many famous directors.

The rumor originated from Director Jim Filmer. The soundtrack of his upcoming film was already creating a buzz in the market.

There was even talk that the best OST award at the Venice Film Festival had already been decided.

“Can you meet him?”

“Leave it to me, Director.”

Tommy, a PD from the American ABA Broadcasting Station, looked determined. He headed straight to Central Park, where the rising star often appeared.

“Tommy, do you think we can really meet him by wandering around like this?”

They couldn’t even find a phone number or email address. Contacting his agency always yielded the same response.

Interview declined, appearance declined. It didn’t make sense. No one ever refused an offer from the ABA Broadcasting Station.

But he was that great. Not only had he captivated Hollywood’s top directors, but he was also receiving love calls from great masters around the world.

“Miguel, go buy some sandwiches. I’m hungry.”

Miguel pouted and walked away.

Not only the ABA Broadcasting Station but also other stations had requested interviews with him, but the response was always the same. He was harder to meet than the President of the United States. Then.

“Oppa, you’re so clumsy!”

There was a couple sitting on a bench in Central Park, basking in their affection. The girl was Asian, with skin fairer than most Caucasians and eyes reminiscent of a cat.

The boy, on the other hand, was eating a sandwich with his hat pulled low. The girl gently brushed crumbs off his lips.

They couldn’t stop smiling just by looking at each other.

It was a beautiful scene under the radiant sunlight of Central Park. But Tommy felt a pang of loneliness seeing them.

“Tommy, they said they’re out of sandwich ingredients.”

“What? Then you should have bought something else.”

“You didn’t tell me to buy anything else. If you’re going to be so picky, you should’ve come with me.”

Tommy rubbed his forehead in frustration. His only subordinate never listened. Moreover, he was almost clueless.

“Idiot, what if Hyun passes by while we’re both away?”

“Tommy, I’m telling you, we can’t meet Hyun! The rumor about him frequenting Central Park is just something Hollywood directors made up. They’re too clever to spread such baseless rumors.”

At that moment.

“Tommy?”

At the familiar name, the boy on the bench looked up.
