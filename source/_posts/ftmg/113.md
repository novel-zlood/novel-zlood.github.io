It was the beginning of a lyrical melody.

The full moon shimmering on the waves seemed to evoke Debussy's Clair de Lune.

As Kang Hyun's fingers delicately embroidered the glistening strings, the audience held their breath, captivated by the stage.

The cheeks of the Russian maestro, Alexei, twitched incessantly. A solo recital is akin to an autobiography of the performer, revealing the path of their musical journey. But to start the first chapter without accompaniment, and with an original composition, no less.

'Are you trying to knock out all the inspirations, you arrogant kid?'

Alexei felt like he had been caught off guard and struck squarely. Surely other maestros and virtuosos felt it too.

Kang Hyun stood on stage as he always did—fearlessly. There were no introductions or gestures from the host.

He captivated the entire audience with just one melody. Before anyone could blink, they were drawn into Kang Hyun's world.

It was then.

Ziiing—!

A piercing high note rippled through the concert hall's ceiling like a wave on a calm lakeshore.

As the echoing melody ended, Kang Hyun's bow began to move fiercely. Continuous harmonics and trills, creating a melody as if played by two violins.

Thirty-second notes whipped across the staff so rapidly it seemed like his fingers might break.

'Amazing.'

William couldn't find the words. His friends' reactions were likely not much different from his own.

William had been striving for the top since the Royal Academy of Music. But he had encountered another wall at the Chapel.

He had thought Kang Hyun was better than them, but not to this extent.

When he heard from Anna that Kang Hyun had given a lecture at the Moscow Conservatory, he thought it was purely theoretical. He hadn't believed Kang Hyun had been devoted to the violin for the past three years. But then.

Gulp—!

What on earth was this immeasurable gap? Kang Hyun hadn't let go of the violin for the past three years. The deepened melody spoke volumes.

Then Kang Hyun smiled and swiftly bowed in one direction. His fingers precisely cut multiple notes as if they were running several times faster than others. A single misstep would have thrown off the melody.

William's hands were already drenched in sweat, tightly clenched.

'Koro, did you think of Carnegie Hall?'

Hirose could tell just by looking at his manager Koro's eyes. He must have been reminded of himself standing at Carnegie Hall decades ago by watching Kang Hyun on stage now.

The Stradivarius, bathed in moonlight, seemed particularly shiny today. The audience must have already felt intense joy from his bowing, just as they did at Carnegie Hall decades ago.

It was unbelievable that such a massive aura could emanate from such a young body, so much so that the grand chandelier seemed like a firefly.

'Antonio Stradivari was right.'

Just like the legend left by the violin maker known to have sold his soul to the devil, if anyone other than the true owner touched these strings, they would lose their sight and hearing.

But on the day the true owner plays the strings of fantasy,

The world will welcome a great virtuoso.

* * *

"Phew―!"

From the shoulders to the elbows to the fingertips, it felt like a blade heated red-hot. It was a ridiculous thought, but he wondered if steam would rise if he poured cold water on it.

Even so, the Stradivarius 'Fantasy' still glistened on the strings, as if it had more to say. Despite playing three consecutive unaccompanied pieces, it seemed unsatisfied.

Indeed, hadn't the black streaks on the red soundboard continually enticed him?

"Hyun, are you okay?"

Baek Junghoon carefully asked about my condition.

"I didn't understand why you structured it to have an intermission after the unaccompanied pieces instead of in the middle of the performance, but now I get it. The audience is completely mesmerized. No one is getting up even after the performance ended."

"Really?"

"And look at your condition. Anyone would think you just came from a fight on stage. You're as well-honed as a gladiator. There won't be any issues with the collaboration, right?"

I nodded with a faint smile.

Baek Junghoon must have been anxious behind the curtain too. His flushed face made it clear.

During the short intermission, I switched and tuned my violin. It was the long-awaited appearance of the Guarneri.

As I returned to the stage, a thunderous applause erupted. It was praise both for the unaccompanied pieces I had just played and for the appearance of Baek Junghoon.

"Huh?"

A puzzled voice came from the audience. It was because the page-turner, who should have been next to the pianist, was missing.

The more notes and complex the piece, the more you need a page-turner to turn the sheet music. They are the closest to the performer but often seem invisible, calling themselves ghosts on stage.

Sometimes there are performances without a page-turner, but that's only possible with well-rehearsed repertoires.

Moreover, wasn't this a collaboration requiring perfect synchronization? A momentary mistake could easily cause a butterfly effect and bring everything down.

'Hyung, are you ready?'

I understood the curious gazes from the audience. On the other hand, the maestros and virtuosos were watching us with interest.

At that moment, Baek Junghoon's long fingers smoothly glided over the black and white keys.

The depth of the piano and Baek Junghoon's breath, unaffected by the gaze of countless audiences, penetrated my ears.

As the awaited piano hammer struck the strings, the bow was lifted.

Thump thump thump.

A single flower, which had grown under the sorrowful rain, responded to the resonance of the piano. It was a concerto with a completely different feel from the sharply refined unaccompanied pieces.

Baek Junghoon's fingers slightly curled, pressing the keys very slowly with the flesh of his fingertips. It was a simple finger relaxation but gave a grand resonance more than any fancy technique.

The ensemble continued endlessly, as if pulling on a string.

Hadn't we practiced the piece so much that our fingertips split and the spaces between them tore?

Baek Junghoon was following my movements very well. At that moment, my fingers moved wildly over the strings, resembling a spider. It was a bowing technique so intense it seemed the strings might break.

It was when a cool breeze fluttered the curtain, as if to wipe away the large beads of sweat running down Baek Junghoon's chin.

Ziiing.

The flower began to bloom as if it couldn't hold back its breath any longer.

* * *

"Did everyone just see that?"

Deng Lun, the Chinese maestro, repeatedly rubbed his eyes with his sleeve. It was already the second intermission, but it was hard to find anyone standing up from their seats. The lingering effect was so intense it gripped the entire body.

"The final collaboration was truly divine. To think I would see someone handle the violin like that in person. Violinist Hyun has grown tremendously in the past three years. My heart still hasn't stopped racing, just like when I first saw him."

The professors from the Shanghai International Music Institute swallowed hard.

It was a trip to Korea decided upon thanks to the enthusiastic push from Deng Lun, the department head.

At first, they weren't that interested in a solo recital by a new violinist. Moreover, wasn't he not even from their own country? But.

It was arrogance and misjudgment.

They never imagined that such a grand concert hall existed in Korea or that the audience would be filled with world-renowned musicians.

At first, they thought they were dreaming. After all, due to the somewhat closed nature of the Shanghai International Music Institute, they had little interest in Kang Hyun, who had stirred up the classical music world three years ago.

Just then, Deng Lun glanced at the professor sitting next to him. It was the soon-to-be department head with impressive thick eyebrows.

"Professor Wang, what did you think of the collaboration between Violinist Hyun and Pianist Baek Junghoon?"

"It's hard to believe, but it felt like Pianist Baek Junghoon was following along. Violinist Hyun was leading the way. General audiences might not notice, but most musicians likely picked up on it. There's a difference in skill between the two. That's why I was surprised. Until now, if I had to name the next great maestro to represent Korea, I wouldn't hesitate to pick Baek Junghoon."

Professor Wang's face showed clear signs of astonishment. Like the other professors, he hadn't had high expectations.

Even though Kang Hyun had stirred up the classical music world three years ago, he hadn't heard anything from him during that period.

But from the very start to the collaboration with the pianist, he couldn't unclench his tightly gripped hands.

Soon, the murmuring audience quickly quieted. Violinist Hyun was stepping onto the stage.

Everyone held their breath at Violinist Hyun's composed gaze, and the eyes of the audience filled with intense joy and excitement.

What kind of performance would he show this time? At that moment, Deng Lun instinctively knew.

"I think Korea will take the lead in the Asian music scene from now on."

None of the professors from the Shanghai National Music Institute could refute his words.

* * *

"Bravo―!"

Cheering and applause following the end of a repertoire are only natural. Sometimes, audiences think they need to stay quiet until the end of a repertoire, but it's better to cheer and whistle enthusiastically. Musicians are never stingy with such applause.

At the end of the lingering effect, the sound of over 2,500 spectators clapping simultaneously shook the entire hall like an earthquake.

The cries of delight stopped the violinist's steps as he walked behind the curtain. As the boy turned around with a helpless smile, female audience members screamed in high-pitched voices.

The blonde Sharon couldn't help but marvel. The pianist Baek Junghoon, who accompanied him, looked bewildered by the massive cheers and applause, while Kang Hyun naturally accepted the situation as if he was born to do so.

It was then.

"As much as the audience wants me, I will respond with an encore."

At the sight of Kang Hyun skillfully engaging with the audience,

"Where on earth did you learn such perfect stage manners?"

Sharon was dumbfounded. Anyone would think he was a seasoned veteran who had gone through countless performances.

Once, Heifetz had said this: The bow does not come down until the end of the cheers.

As Kang Hyun moved, his entire body started to tingle as if meeting his first love. What kind of piece would he play this time?

How much time had passed?

"I hope I'm not too late."

It was a fantastic encore performance. This solo recital would surely be followed by numerous columns and articles. The classical music world was bound to be abuzz.

Sharon felt deeply regretful. It was such a shame that this solo recital would be a one-time event.

"I have to get an interview somehow, so he doesn't forget me like last time when he called me a noisy lady and didn't remember me."

She hadn't expected Kang Hyun to not remember her. With her distinct features and flowing blonde hair, she was quite memorable, wasn't she?

But that wasn't important now. The end of the solo recital was the perfect opportunity. Once today was over, it was clear that foreign media would evaluate Kang Hyun differently.

"Violinist Hyun."

It was when she carefully opened the door to the waiting room. The outside was still noisy since the solo recital had just ended, but that was not the problem. There would be time before the autograph session. However, as soon as Sharon opened the door and entered, she froze like a stone.

'What on earth.'

She felt like closing the door right away. Sharon, usually strong-willed, had never faced so many maestros in one place.

Starting with the eternal maestro Gustav, Hirose, Spencer, and Yuri. Along with them were Russia's Alexei and China's Deng Lun, all sitting together.
