Sunyoung Park was trying to calm her breathing and focus. Had she ever been this nervous in her life? She could confidently say that such moments could be counted on one hand.

The weight of the name "New York Philharmonic" was pressing down on her shoulders, incomparable to taking the entrance exam for Korea University or stepping onto the finals stage of a competition.

"I can do it."

Among numerous applicants, Sunyoung Park muttered to herself in Korean as if casting a spell.

How much had she worked to apply for the audition of the New York Philharmonic?

To someone not familiar with classical music, joining as a new member might not seem like a big deal, but the case was different for major symphony orchestras.

Even after dedicating a lifetime to music, it wasn't uncommon to fail to join even as a new member.

"Anthony, have you heard Violinist Hyun's symphony?"

"Of course, I heard it. I saw it was ranked 7th on the charts today."

"Oh my god, at this rate, it might really become the first classical piece to top the Billboard charts!"

Nearby, people were buzzing about the Violinist Hyun, who had recently become a hot topic.

Undoubtedly, there would be a commotion in Korea as well. A classical piece aiming for the top spot on the Billboard singles chart, not a popular song, was an extraordinary feat.

"Hyun is really becoming more famous by the day."

Sunyoung Park thought of little Kang Hyun, whom she met at a mansion in Pyeongchang-dong in the past. At that time, she knew he had immense talent in music but never expected it to be to this extent.

Winning the Queen Elisabeth Competition, performing for the British royal family, and now the Billboard charts—Kang Hyun's position among world-renowned maestros was now so high that Sunyoung could no longer even dream of reaching it. Just then,

"SUNYEONG PARK."

Her name was called by a New York Philharmonic official. Although they said the audition order was random, she never expected to be the first.

Sunyoung Park felt her heart pounding uncontrollably. Her mind went blank like a white sheet of paper, and her mouth felt parched as if it were on fire.

"I can do it, I can do it."

Repeating her mantra internally, she took heavy steps forward.

"Ms. Sunyoung Park, I see you graduated from a university in Korea and studied at the Collyde School of Music in Philadelphia. You received a recommendation letter from the head of Collyde and served as a first violinist in the Paris Symphony Orchestra for several years. The concertmaster of the Paris Symphony also highly praised you. So why didn't you stay in Paris? As far as I know, the first violin chair at the Paris Symphony will soon become vacant."

This was a question from Antonio, the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic.

Sunyoung Park's resume was impeccable. Although she had never won a competition, she had placed in every one she entered, and she had graduated with excellent grades from Collyde, a prestigious music school in Philadelphia. She had followed a textbook career path.

Moreover, if she set her mind to it, aiming for the first violin chair in the Paris Symphony wouldn't have been difficult.

"Ms. Sunyoung Park?"

Antonio's voice startled Sunyoung, and she quickly responded.

"I'm sorry, I was so nervous that I momentarily lost my words. The reason I left the Paris Symphony and am auditioning for the New York Philharmonic is simple. I've watched the New York Philharmonic perform since I was young, and this has always been my dream orchestra."

Sunyoung Park occasionally glanced at Kang Hyun, who was seated at the head table. Who would have thought that Hyun would be sitting at the head table in the New York Philharmonic audition room?

At first, she was simply happy to see him. But Kang Hyun's aura had changed drastically from the past.

When he was a child, he had an old soul, but it wasn't to this extent.

Now, he had the presence of a renowned maestro, and his deep gaze seemed to tighten around her, leaving no room to breathe.

"Please play the piece you have prepared."

Sunyoung Park took a deep breath and picked up her violin from its case.

She had performed on countless stages, but never had she been this nervous. Especially with Kang Hyun's intense gaze, she felt as if she were naked.

How much time had passed?

She couldn't remember how she started or ended her performance.

Although the seemingly eternal moment of her performance ended, Antonio remained silent, and so did the associate concertmaster.

Then, from the head table, Kang Hyun, who had been quietly observing, spoke for the first time.

"Ms. Sunyoung Park, Vivaldi's Four Seasons, Winter, 3rd movement."

At Kang Hyun's direction, Sunyoung quickly picked up her violin again. Just before she raised her bow, Kang Hyun mouthed to her once more.

"Noona, relax your shoulders."

This time, he spoke in Korean, which only they could understand.

"Hyung, press the keys a bit deeper at this part."

A week had passed. Jung-hoon Baek had received rigorous training from Kang Hyun, harsh enough to be called Spartan training.

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that even when he first learned to play the piano, he hadn't spent this much time sitting on the piano bench.

"A bit softer but more intense―!"

Following Kang Hyun's instructions, Jung-hoon Baek played.

The score was a relentless display of notes and musical symbols, pushing the performer to their limits.

Even Jung-hoon Baek, who had played numerous high-difficulty pieces, was astounded by the score.

"Huff, huff."

Jung-hoon Baek finished playing and panted heavily. His long fingers had to dance on the keys without a single moment of rest, like playing the "Mephisto Waltz." Yet ironically, his fingers, which had suffered from tendinitis, felt surprisingly light.

"Hyung, want to grab a beer?"

Just like the time they watched stars together on the roof of the Gallery Jeil, Kang Hyun took out two cans of beer from the fridge and shook them.

Only then could Jung-hoon Baek smile. During the lesson, Kang Hyun had turned into a tiger-like teacher but was now back to being the Hyun he remembered.

Kang Hyun and Jung-hoon Baek took their beers and headed to the rooftop.

"You can't see the stars as well here as in Korea."

Perhaps because the studio was located in the heart of New York, there were no stars or even moonlight, obscured by clouds.

Under the soft glow of the full moon, the two men sipped their beers.

Kang Hyun and Jung-hoon Baek caught up on conversations they hadn't had in a while, from stories of being surrounded by Hollywood directors to appearing on "The Ellen Show." Their chatter was ceaseless, like high school girls gossiping.

Especially when talking about Son Yooha, Jung-hoon Baek teased Hyun mercilessly. Laughter echoed from the studio rooftop.

"By the way, I just came back from an audition today."

"An audition?"

"Yes, I was invited as a judge for the New York Philharmonic's entrance audition."

Kang Hyun explained to Jung-hoon Baek about the events of the day.

The highlight was undoubtedly Sunyoung Park. Who would have thought that their connection from Korea would continue in New York?

Listening quietly to Hyun's evaluation of the audition performances, Jung-hoon Baek asked,

"So, did she get selected?"

"The decision is up to Antonio. I was only there to observe. But judging by the skills of the other violinists who auditioned, Sunyoung noona will likely be chosen."

"Was she that good?"

"No, the other applicants were relatively not as good."

Hyun couldn't hide his disappointment at the audition. He had high expectations for the violinists applying to the New York Philharmonic, but their skills were not as remarkable as he had hoped. Were they all too nervous?

Sensing Hyun's thoughts, Jung-hoon Baek added,

"Hyun, your standards have become too high."

"Me?"

"Yes, think of the musicians you’ve collaborated with."

Hyun felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over his head. Jung-hoon Baek's words had a point.

It wasn't about selecting a veteran but choosing new members for the orchestra.

Hyun realized that his dissatisfaction with the applicants might have been because he was used to working with exceptionally talented violinists.

* * *

"Sunyoung, congratulations!"

Sunyoung Park received congratulatory messages from her parents, who were far away, and greeted a fresh morning.

She had been accepted as a new member of the New York Philharmonic.

How tense had she been during the two weeks waiting for the results? Each day had been more nerve-wracking than her college entrance exam.

“Noona, relax your shoulders.”

Relaxing her previously tense shoulders, Sunyoung headed to the New York Philharmonic concert hall.

Even as she looked at the concert hall building, she couldn't believe she had passed the audition.

If it hadn't been for Hyun's advice just before her second performance at the audition, she wouldn't have been able to deliver a flawless performance.

"Hello, I'm Sunyoung Park―!"

Introducing herself with her Korean name, Sunyoung Park, rather than an Americanized name, the members greeted her without much fuss. After all, many new members didn't last long and left within months.

Many musicians joined the New York Philharmonic with dreams and hopes, but it was known that enduring there was even tougher. Without rigorous self-discipline and talent, one would be eliminated.

"Violinists Colton, Dresen, Mirai!"

Violinists who had already made their names in America were also members of the New York Philharmonic.

As Sunyoung greeted them, she was bewildered, wondering if this was a dream or reality. Such famous individuals were part of this orchestra.

The members were busy tuning their instruments. Most were recognized for their musical talent, but they were meticulous as if they wouldn't tolerate a single mistake. The atmosphere was quite different from the Paris Symphony Orchestra.

"Attention, everyone. From today, we'll start rehearsing for the collaboration with Maestro Hyun. Stay sharp―!"

Concertmaster Antonio addressed the members. The mention of "Maestro Hyun" immediately changed the members' expressions.

"New members will not participate in today's rehearsal and will sit in the audience. Starting with Hyun's guidance might be too overwhelming."

What was this about? The new members, including Sunyoung, were left speechless.

It was well-known that the New York Philharmonic didn't cater to new members. They had prepared for the worst, but being relegated to the audience was unexpected. At that moment,

Thud.

A young Asian man stepped onto the stage. Even without an introduction, his gait and gaze made it clear who he was.

Sunyoung Park felt a strange atmosphere on stage.

"Something's changed."

With Hyun's appearance, she noticed a shift in the members' demeanor. The veterans who had been so confident were now tense because of Hyun's presence.

This change wasn't limited to the regular members. Even Antonio, the real power of the orchestra, welcomed Hyun with a sense of tension.

Watching Hyun, Sunyoung wondered if this was the same person she knew.

Hyun naturally stepped onto the stage and, without any explanation, raised his hand to the members.
