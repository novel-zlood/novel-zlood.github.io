As Tommy stepped onto the stage, he felt as if he might stop breathing. The tension that had been simmering in the waiting room surged back up to his throat.

No wonder, considering that among the countless audience members were many keen-eyed musicians.

Performing in front of them felt like standing naked on stage.

Gulp.

At that moment, Sabrina gently took Tommy's hand. When Tommy looked at her with wide eyes, she mouthed carefully, "I'm here."

"It's okay."

Only then did Tommy's tension vanish as if it were a lie. Instead, an inexplicable excitement seemed to fill the void.

Kang Hyun, seeing the two of them, smiled faintly and stepped forward.

“It is a great honor to be able to perform first thanks to the maestro’s proposal. The piece we will be playing for you is an original composition, inspired by the Milky Way, as depicted by the great artist Mitarchel.”

The audience buzzed at the mention of an original composition. Until they stepped onto the stage, the participants kept their performance pieces a secret, and even the professors looked visibly surprised.

Indeed, no undergraduate had ever dared to present an original composition at a music concert before.

Moreover, any ordinary undergraduate would have been nervous around other more experienced musicians, but Kang Hyun showed no such signs.

On the contrary, he seemed to be exchanging glances with each member of the audience, as if making eye contact with every single one of them.

“We have pondered deeply about the harmonies that can be created between the violin and cello. We hope our trio’s original piece will be to your liking. Now, we invite you to 'Dreamlike Spirit' by our trio.”

The gazes of the three intertwined. The audience was watching them with excited eyes, wondering what kind of music would flow out.

Soon, the silver-haired Sabrina signaled the start of the piece.

The first to play was Sabrina.

A sweet melody resonated throughout the music hall.

Although there was no bold bowing or flamboyant technique, the straightforward melody evoked an inexplicable and subtle emotion, like the start of a first love.

The sound passed refreshingly like the wind crossing a field of reeds.

The audience, having only heard rumors of Sabrina's performance, couldn't take their eyes or ears off her.

Her silver hair seemed to dance as she played, and the masterful performance that conveyed her musical ideas made even the greats in the audience feel parched.

Then, another violin sound joined in harmony.

Responding to Sabrina’s violin, Kang Hyun’s fantasy began to resonate.

Like recalling the wind that had blown away, the fantasy created a song.

Leaving footprints in a snowy night sky, the continuous melody left a lingering feeling.

Kang Hyun's trills rang out fiercely. It was as if they were creating harmony by playing different instruments.

The separated arpeggios and glissandos, sliding like walking on icy steps, and the endlessly connected legatos.

Though it seemed like each was playing their own piece, the two violins were breathing together, facing each other.

The connection was so perfect that it was impossible to count how many times they had practiced together.

Soon, fingers moved freely as if there were no gaps between the strings, and trills rang out as if sending signals.

At that moment, when the trills, like footsteps in a snowstorm, continued.

Tommy's bow touched the strings.

With both legs supporting the cello, Tommy's eyes were gently closed. There wasn't a trace of tension on his face.

He was sending the heat that rose from his shoulder straight to the tip of the bow.

At the end of the smoothly connected posture, old emotions were discarded.

The Tommy who had been playing while trapped in preconceptions was gone. It was as if he had opened a new horizon, newly understanding and accepting the cello.

Professor Albert watched with wide eyes. The two violins seemed to be creating a bridge for Tommy, allowing the cello to fully bloom.

Everyone must have felt it. The fact that Tommy’s cello was spreading the Milky Way throughout the music hall.

* * *

Professor Albert's pupils were shaking as if an earthquake had struck.

Even after the trio's performance ended, many audience members were still immersed in the lingering effects, but Professor Albert was by far the most affected.

Understandably, he was Tommy's cello professor. Suddenly, he remembered the advice he had given Tommy:

“Use their talents and indulge yourself freely.”

At the time, he had simply wanted Tommy, who was blocked by his own limitations, to see some possibilities. But now...

Gulp.

It was unbelievable how incredibly Tommy showcased his performance. In less than a month, Tommy seemed like a completely different person.

His cello, elegantly unfolding like the Milky Way, was mesmerizing enough to captivate the eyes and ears of the masters in an instant.

Professor Albert finally recalled Kang Hyun's words.

“What our trio needs the most is Tommy.”

He had wondered why the geniuses Kang Hyun and Sabrina had chosen Tommy.

But after watching the trio’s performance, he truly understood. Kang Hyun’s words were neither exaggerated to lift Tommy up nor a lie.

Indeed, the performance they had just witnessed was something only Tommy, among all the cello major undergraduates, could have done.

Realizing this subtle difference more precisely than he could, despite his lifelong experience with the cello, Albert felt as if cold water had been poured over his head as he sat there in a daze.

“Spencer, your student is truly amazing.”

“Student…”

At the question from Principal Samuel, Spencer showed a faint smile. Could he truly call himself Kang Hyun's sole teacher?

While he had inspired Kang Hyun musically and developed his conducting skills, he had felt from the very beginning that he was facing a fully formed gem.

Samuel, you were right.

Just as he had felt on the flight to England, facing the gem had also altered his own musical values.

Though he wished to induct him into the London Symphony Orchestra immediately, how could that be?

The gem's value shone more fiercely with time, making its name known. Once his life at the Royal Academy of Music ended, he would undoubtedly grow even more.

Moreover, how many masters coveted that gem? Not only the masters from around the world but even retired legends had been so captivated by the gem’s magic that they had picked up the baton again.

Spencer felt the same. Without Kang Hyun, he might never have played the violin again.

Spencer hoped. If possible, he wanted to be his teacher.

He was a child who could complete his musical values, but that would be Spencer's greatest desire in life.

“I’ll get up first. I need to prepare for my performance as well.”

Spencer stood up with an unusually tense face.

Principal Samuel tilted his head in confusion as he watched Spencer’s retreating figure. He couldn’t recall ever seeing Spencer with such an expression.

Surely, no one would know. Today’s performance was intended for just one audience member.

* * *

Despite the approaching winter, the bright sunshine streamed through the window.

Kang Hyun, missing the now-gone autumn leaves, shook the water from his hair.

Just as he was lost in thought, welcoming the inspiration of the coming winter.

“Mmmmeow.”

As always, a freckled boy was sleeping on Kang Hyun’s bed. It had been a month since the concert ended, but Tommy still rented a room, learning music from Kang Hyun.

“Saabrina…”

What kind of dream was he having, continuously calling Sabrina’s name? Kang Hyun quietly approached him and looked at his face. It didn’t seem like a nightmare. The freckles were blushing, turning into red spots.

“Wake up, man.”

Wasn't the sun already high in the sky? When Kang Hyun lifted the blanket, Tommy woke up with a start from the cold air, like a squirrel suddenly awakened from hibernation.

Kang Hyun smiled at the sight and straightened his clothes.

How did the concert go?

Of course, Kang Hyun’s trio won the grand prize. Along with Maestro Spencer, they shared the grand prize.

It was said to be the first time in the history of the Royal Academy of Music’s concert. Spencer’s violin performance had been so amazing that even Kang Hyun had been astonished. By the way…

“Why are you two sticking so close together?”

At the dining hall, Sabrina and Tommy were sitting right next to each other instead of across from each other.

When Kang Hyun asked, stabbing a piece of bacon with his fork, Tommy looked like he was about to spit out his soup in surprise. On the other hand, Sabrina responded nonchalantly.

“Because I like it.”

Tommy's freckles quickly turned red. Kang Hyun nodded briefly, as if he had expected that answer, and resumed eating.

Of course, having spent so much time together as a trio, how could he not notice the subtle connection between them? By the way…

“Tommy, didn’t you say your type was someone older?”

“Wh-when did I…!”

“Just kidding.”

Seeing the two holding hands as they left the dining hall, it was clear that spring had come for Tommy as well. Naturally, people’s attention was drawn to them. Sabrina was quite a well-known figure at the Royal Academy of Music.

Moreover, after the recent concert, Tommy had also joined the ranks of the famous.

Professor Albert, known for his strictness, had acknowledged Tommy’s cello playing.

However, the two of them made an unusual sight. Seeing Sabrina holding Tommy’s hand tightly while he trembled like an aspen tree, Kang Hyun thought she was quite a commanding figure.

After parting ways with the two, Kang Hyun walked alone. While strolling through the garden connected to the entrance of the Royal Academy of Music and organizing his musical ideas.

“Snow?”

In England, known for rarely having snow, evidence of winter was falling from the sky.

Maybe because winter had arrived, he felt a sudden chill in his heart.

Kang Hyun shook his head. Considering his past life, he had lived alone for more years than he could count, so this level of loneliness was nothing. At that moment.

Oh.

Kang Hyun rubbed his eyes with his sleeve, hardly believing what he was seeing.

As his vision became clearer, the chill in his heart disappeared, and an unexpected excitement filled his eyes.

The reason was simple. A single girl was walking towards him.

Just when he suspected it might be a dream.

“Oppa!”

With a very desired voice, Yooha, wearing a red scarf, came into view.

It seemed that winter’s spring had come for Kang Hyun as well.
