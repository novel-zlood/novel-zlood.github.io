Would it really be possible for musicians from around the world to gather in one place?

Numerous maestros, including Germany's Yuri, America's Bilstein, Russia's Maxim Ivanov, Belgium's Edensimon, and Japan's Hikaru Akazawa, all appeared at the London Symphony Concert Hall.

“It’s a feast of stars.”

Adam, the chief editor of Gramophone, remarked as he gazed at the scene in the concert hall.

Not just one, but a large number of globally renowned maestros appeared.

Even the Crown Prince of England and distinguished guests from neighboring countries occupied the royal seats.

Security at the London Symphony Concert Hall was tighter than ever.

“Adam, have you ever seen so many maestros in one place?”

At Sharon's question, Adam shook his head firmly. It was the first time he had encountered so many maestros in person.

Not only famous maestros but also those who had disappeared from the scene made an appearance.

It would have been impossible without the return stage of the empress, Karas.

“Hyun is truly mysterious. It was Hyun who handed the baton back to Maestro Karas, gathering so many maestros as if he were the eye of a storm.”

Adam looked at Kang Hyun, who was seated in the royal section.

His neatly combed hair and suit suited him well. He no longer looked like a young boy but had matured into a young man. His appearance was comparable to that of any actor.

Moreover, his musical talent was beyond words. The numerous maestros who had come to see Karas's stage occasionally stole glances at Kang Hyun.

At that moment.

The bustling concert hall suddenly fell silent, and the spotlight focused on the stage.

Excitement and anticipation filled the eyes of the audience.

Maestro Karas, who had not shown herself for over a decade, was stepping onto the stage.

*Rustle*

Her pure white dress harmonized beautifully with her deep brown hair. The baton was made of well-worn ash wood.

Karas bowed her head to the audience with her wrinkled hands gathered in front of her.

“I bow my head in gratitude to the audience who have come a long way. I am Karas, the conductor for today's performance.”

Thunderous applause erupted. The feelings of the maestros in the audience were indescribable.

They thought they would never see Karas's conducting again in their lifetime.

“The first piece I will perform is Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 in D major, Titan.”

The maestro smiled and turned to the orchestra members.

The members of the London Symphony, who had practiced tirelessly for the empress's return stage, looked visibly tense.

After all, the audience was full of people with profound knowledge of music. Any small mistake would not be tolerated, especially on the empress's return stage.

As nervous sweat formed on their hands, Karas made eye contact with each member.

Calmly, like flowing water.

At that moment, the members' tension disappeared as if it were a lie.

The tip of the baton pointed towards the ceiling, and the string melody caressed the ears. It was the slow first movement in 4/4 time in D major.

The maestros leaned forward and immersed themselves in Karas's conducting.

As her hand swept through the air, the members moved in unison, as if tuning a small world.

When the tip of the baton tapped the ceiling again, the trumpet sound heralded the dawn, like fish breaking the ice in a frozen reservoir in winter.

The wild Scherzo and Trio resonated vividly with the audience, like a scene from a movie.

From darkness to light.

Hadn't Mahler himself said that in the stormy fourth movement, the audience would hold their breath and widen their eyes?

It was the same now. As the maestro's shoulder and fingertips moved as one, the grand and volcanic sound of the giant's footsteps continuously pierced the audience's ears.

*Rustle!*

The pure white dress fluttered like a bird soaring towards the sky as the maestro's fingertips pointed to the ceiling.

The audience witnessed a vivid scene before their eyes, drawing a picture of the melody.

Like animals awakening from hibernation, finding the vitality of spring, journeying towards the light.

At that moment, Kang Hyun felt a premonition as he watched the maestro's conducting. The legend had returned!

“Are you talking about a dormitory?”

Dmitri heard something unexpected. It was that Kang Hyun, not only entered the Royal Academy of Music as an exchange student but also decided to live in a dormitory.

Spencer gave a slight nod with a faint smile.

“The headmaster personally approved his admission, and the professors have welcomed Hyun with open arms. If he wanted, he could buy a penthouse in downtown London with his wealth, but he said he wanted to experience dorm life while staying as an exchange student.”

“That’s surprising. I thought he would be very particular about his privacy.”

“Well, he has probably never met geniuses his own age, so he might be curious. Come to think of it, Dmitri, you lived in a dormitory when you were at the Moscow Conservatory, didn’t you?”

Dmitri did not deny it.

“Yes, Maestro. Back then, all undergraduates had to live in dormitories in Moscow. Looking back, it was no different from the military. As you know, the seniority culture in Moscow was very strict. Would you believe me if I said I washed the pillowcase of my senior, violinist Vin Pollo, every week?”

Vin Pollo, a famous violinist from the Moscow Conservatory, is known for his skeletal frame in the classical music world.

In contrast, concertmaster Dmitri has a typical Russian build and sharp eyes that could intimidate a bear.

The thought of him personally washing the pillowcase of a skeletal man made one chuckle.

“The members want to meet Hyun, but it seems they’ll have fewer chances if he’s staying in the dormitory.”

“That’s likely. Moreover, the assignments at the Royal Academy of Music are so rigorous that he probably won’t have much free time.”

“Is it that tough?”

“In the past, most students couldn’t graduate. They barely avoided failing by meeting the strict standards. Even Crown Prince Samuel, who is now the headmaster, always plotted with me to escape.”

It was hard to believe that Spencer, the maestro known as the heart of the London Symphony, once plotted to escape. But his expression was as serious as ever.

“The Royal Academy of Music, it’s been decades since I graduated. There was no exchange student program back then. Even now, it’s more nominal, and they haven’t accepted an exchange student until now. It will be interesting. I’d love to visit the Royal Academy of Music again. The professors and students will be highly interested in Hyun.”

Spencer licked his dry lips as if reminiscing about the past.

“He is the first exchange student in history.”

For some reason, it felt like going back to my days as a law student in Sillim-dong.

After being admitted to the law department at Hankook University in my previous life, I immediately lived alone in Sillim-dong.

I remember carrying around giant law books that could be used as weapons and heading to a small gosiwon room where two steps would take you from one end to the other.

“Compared to back then, this is heaven.”

The dormitory at the Royal Academy of Music was spacious enough to be called a palace compared to the gosiwon room from my previous life. It was a single room equipped with a desk and a personal bed.

Moreover, there was a window right in front of the desk overlooking the garden of the Royal Academy of Music. It was nothing short of a suite room.

As one of the top music schools in Europe, the students' skills were exceptional.

The melody coming through the window clearly indicated the skill of a cellist who had been playing the instrument for quite some time.

There was no need for a CD player as the scent of classical Western music wafted from all directions. But then,

‘How long do they plan to stare at me like I’m a zoo animal?’

Even during the meeting with the Crown Prince headmaster, the intense gazes were undeniable as I carried my luggage into the dormitory.

Most looked at me with curiosity, like they were observing a mysterious animal in a zoo, while others showed eyes filled with envy and jealousy.

Of course, many students at a music school in London would dream of joining the London Symphony.

Maestro Spencer, usually a man of few words, had praised me in interviews, calling me the future leader, so their reactions were understandable.

At that moment.

*Knock, knock.*

I opened the door to the sound of knocking and saw a freckle-faced boy peeking in.

“Hi, I’m Tommy. You must be Hyun, the exchange student, right? I major in cello, and I’ve been assigned to show you around the school!”

“Assigned?”

“Oh, the violin majors are busy with competitions right now. You know, it’s the Queen Elisabeth Competition season.”

Ah, now that he mentioned it, it must be time for the Queen Elisabeth Competition.

This year, the competition was for violin, so every student majoring in violin must have applied.

“Hyun, have you had dinner yet?”

“Not yet.”

“Great, then let’s head to the dining hall first! Everyone’s waiting for you!”

Tommy acted as if he had known me for a long time.

As I was led by the freckle-faced boy through the dormitory hallway, many students of various races stared at me again.

It felt like I had become a transfer student in the midst of a storm.

“Hyun, you must understand their curiosity. You were already famous before you enrolled. Professors often talk about you during lessons. Being the joint disciple of the chief conductor of the London Symphony and the legendary Maestro Karas is like something straight out of a movie.”

“A movie?”

“Yes, you wouldn’t believe how eagerly the female students are waiting for you. You probably have a lot of fans already. Hyun, you’re really attractive, you know.”

I wondered if this is how Harry Potter felt when he first entered Hogwarts.

Moreover, judging by Tommy’s suspicious look, I felt I needed to keep my distance from him. He looked at me with eyes full of affection, as if gazing at someone he loved.

“Here we are. What do you think?”

“It’s really spacious.”

“It has to be, since all undergraduates dine here at the same time. But except for the monthly dinner with the headmaster on the first day of each month, it’s rare for all students to gather. They often skip meals because of practice.”

“Wait, today is the first day, isn’t it?”

Just then, students started arriving at the dining hall one after another.

Tommy held my hand and led me to a designated seat. It seemed today was indeed the dinner with the headmaster.

As I watched more and more students fill the dining hall, Tommy added,

“By the way, have you thought about how you’ll introduce yourself?”

What?

“The headmaster will introduce you to the students today.”

It seemed my initiation would be quite an event.
