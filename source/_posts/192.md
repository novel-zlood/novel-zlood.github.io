Ten thousand times...?

It's easy to say ten thousand times, but even repeating a simple action a mere hundred times would cause severe strain on the body.

Moreover, the conducting movement that Karas just demonstrated was not at all simple.

Although he had conducted numerous symphonies like Beethoven's Fate, Choral, Tchaikovsky's Pathetique, and Dvořák's New World, the conducting Karas had just shown was on a different level.

Maestro?

Karas had already walked far away, as if to say her job was done.

All that was left in the spot where she had stood was a branch that had just sliced through the air, substituting for a baton.

Could he do it?

Of course, it was do or die.

After all, how many times had he read the legal code while preparing for the bar exam in his past life? The number of times he repeated writing out the legal clauses was countless.

He had confidence in his perseverance, which he believed was second to none. Once he made up his mind, he immediately bent down to pick up the branch.

“Hoo—!”

There was no one watching, yet his entire body was tense. To exaggerate, he wasn’t even this nervous when taking the bar exam.

But as he recalled the conducting movements Karas had just shown, the tension melted away as if by magic.

He raised his wrist a bit higher, aligning it with his elbow. Even his shoulder and foot spacing mimicked Karas's.

The prelude part surely started with an eight-beat count. As the baton slowly embraced the air like cradling a baby, it swiftly drew down the horizon.

“Again.”

He spoke lowly to himself. The conducting was distinctly different from what Karas had shown.

Though he thought he had imitated it exactly, he was dissatisfied from the very start.

He slowly raised the baton again.

“Again.”

The same was true as time passed. In his mind, the conducting movements Karas had shown were vividly recorded as if they were scenes from a movie.

But the more he tried to follow, the harder it was to do as he wished. It felt like being asked to run before even learning to walk.

Before he knew it, the forest had taken on a serene stillness without a breath of wind.

“Again.”

Several hours had already passed, but he had only managed to imitate it about ten times. Even then, it was far from evoking the resonance of the forest as Karas did. It was the first time he had experienced such frustration in his musical journey.

The forest animals watched this scene as if they found it amusing.

“Again.”

His stubbornness flared up.

“Maestro, will he be alright?”

Maya, the secretary, looked visibly worried. It was understandable since dusk had long fallen in the forest, yet Kang Hyun showed no signs of stopping his practice.

For several hours already, he had been relentlessly moving his shoulders and arms without taking a single breath.

“Maya, what do you think is Hyun’s weakness?”

It was an unexpected question. To Maya, the young conductor Kang Hyun seemed to have no weaknesses.

Not only as a conductor. Despite his young age, he had won the Queen Elisabeth Competition and received love calls from great masters around the world.

Especially unforgettable was the high praise from Maestro Gustav, who was as ruthlessly critical in music as he was renowned.

“Didn't even Maestro praise Hyun highly? Honestly, I have never seen Maestro show this much interest in another conductor. I cannot find any weaknesses in Hyun.”

“Hyun’s weakness is in his perfection.”

“Excuse me?”

She didn’t understand. How could perfection be a weakness? But Karas's expression was firm and resolute.

Her gaze was directed at the forest where Kang Hyun was.

“Hyun is a tremendously talented child. It's not an exaggeration to say that the god of music is watching over him. It's unimaginable how someone so young could possess such talent. Perhaps this is how many musicians felt living in the same era as Mozart.”

It was high praise. Even Karas herself was a legendary maestro who marked the pinnacle of the 20th century.

Many music critics had once declared that there would never be a conductor more outstanding than her in modern music history. It was needless to say more when even she was astonished.

“That is his weakness. He has never experienced failure.”

“Failure, you say?”

“Many musicians feel despair and frustration when they hit a wall. For some, that wall is another person; for others, it is themselves. I believe Hyun needs to feel that wall.”

When Karas told Kang Hyun to “do it ten thousand times,” it wasn’t merely about completing ten thousand repetitions. It was to gain some enlightenment through that long period.

Maya looked at Karas with curious eyes.

“Maestro, have you had such an experience?”

“Feeling the wall?”

“Yes, Maestro.”

Karas smiled faintly. She was known as an unparalleled genius who had captivated the hearts of classical music fans around the world from her debut stage.

Ultimately, she was called the Empress of Austria, with the saying that the Queen of Austria resides in the castle of the blue sky. She was at the pinnacle as a conductor.

“Yes, I have.”

“You, Maestro?”

“It was when I first learned to conduct. My teacher told me, ‘Karas, you don’t have what it takes to be a conductor.’”

Maya's eyes widened in surprise. But Karas could not continue speaking. Her face was deeply etched with recollections from the past.

As the full moon rose, Karas gazed out the window.

“Hyun is truly a mysterious boy. Not only has the god of music endowed him with talent, but he also possesses such perseverance and tenacity. When talking to him, it feels like conversing with someone my own age. If my teacher were alive, I’d be curious to know what he would say upon seeing Hyun.”

* * *

“Again—!”

His breath grew ragged. His shoulders, elbows, and even his fingertips trembled.

Conducting felt like waves crashing, causing his muscles to spasm. His back and even his pant legs were drenched in sweat.

“Again!”

He couldn’t give up. Karas hadn’t told him to complete ten thousand repetitions in one go.

A normal person would interpret that as practicing ten thousand times over an extended period.

But once he started practicing, that logic no longer applied.

“Again!”

It was as if a deep thirst within him kept him from stopping the more he conducted. Even the forest animals now held their breath, watching him. His mind kept replaying Karas's conducting.

“Again!”

Although it was the same movement, it was different from Karas’s. It felt stifling as if blocked by an invisible wall.

His breath grew heavier and sweat poured down like a torrential rain, yet he had no intention of stopping.

How had Karas made the forest resonate?

He had conducted numerous symphonies and even composed one, but the empress’s conducting was not easy to follow.

“Again!”

As time passed, it felt more like he was getting lost in a maze.

He now wondered if he was even doing it right.

His shoulders and elbows were already groaning from the spasms. He bit the inside of his cheek to stay focused.

But how much time had passed? As the full moon rose and the dawn approached, his body tilted towards the ground.

Thud!

* * *

“Such remarkable perseverance.”

Karas expressed pure admiration. She hadn’t expected him to practice until he lost consciousness.

Even conducting a simple 4/4 beat consumed a significant amount of physical strength.

Though she had told him “ten thousand times,” she hadn’t meant in one go.

But Kang Hyun had practiced as if he wouldn’t stop until he conducted just like her. It was truly terrifying perseverance and dedication.

“The patient has exhausted his physical strength. He should rest and avoid leaving his bed for a while. Especially his arms, which have undergone multiple muscle spasms, so he should avoid strenuous activities.”

The attending physician looked puzzled. Sure, the patient was a musician, but the muscle spasms in his shoulders and arms suggested a training regime akin to that of an athlete.

Fortunately, rest would allow him to recover. Only then did Son Yooha's tearful face brighten.

“Ugh.”

It was quite some time after the attending physician had left. Kang Hyun slowly opened his eyes halfway. At that instant, Son Yooha threw her arms around his neck.

“Ow, it hurts, Yooha.”

The scene looked almost like a heartfelt reunion of soldiers returning from deployment.

Karas smiled faintly at the young couple's reunion. But when Kang Hyun noticed Karas, he immediately sat up in bed.

“I’m sorry, Maestro.”

“Hyun, what are you apologizing for?”

“I only managed to practice a hundred times. My stamina wasn’t up to the task.”

Karas marveled once more at the boy's perseverance. She understood better than anyone how relentlessly Kang Hyun had practiced.

The number one hundred might seem small, but repeating the exact same conducting movements as her would feel like shaving off one’s bones.

“Hyun, did you feel the wall?”

“I did. It felt like something was blocking my way.”

It was the frustration and despair that many musicians faced. Even Baek Jung-hoon had felt stuck against a wall for a while, causing his music to stagnate. Kang Hyun was now experiencing the same thing. He was confronting new limitations in conducting he had never felt before.

“Have you ever felt this way before?”

Kang Hyun shook his head. In this life, unlike the previous one, he was overflowing with musical talent to the point where it seemed almost unreal. The upgraded software undoubtedly played a significant role.

Thanks to that, he had never experienced the slump that others often faced. He had never encountered difficulties while learning music. But why now?

“Hyun, are you really getting up already?”

Despite the first-time hardship, Kang Hyun felt even more competitive. The attending physician had advised rest, but he felt pressed for time.

Son Yooha looked helplessly at Karas, but Karas, as a fellow musician, fully understood Kang Hyun’s determination.

In a way, it was astonishing. The culmination of genius talent and perseverance was exhilarating to imagine.
