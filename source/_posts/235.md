Tommy took a deep breath and positioned himself.

He sat down as if perched on a chair, straightened his back like an old tree, and firmly supported the cello with both legs.

His shoulders, which had drawn the horizon, were slightly lowered as if the day was ending, and he carefully raised the bow.

In the past, Tommy had played while being trapped in fixed ideas. He followed the musical notations step by step, without abandoning his subjective thoughts.

But now it was different. As Tommy's will flowed through his shoulders and reached the tip of the bow, ancient emotions were discarded, and the bow crossed the strings.

The emotion of the slowly rising melody began to fill the practice room as if dancing.

Tommy was smiling. He was playing without looking at the sheet music, only recalling the notes on the staff in his mind.

At that moment, when Tommy's bow sharply crossed the strings, the light and refreshing dance-like waltz began to change rapidly.

As if feeling thirst, the bow began to sharply indulge in the strings.

His fingers pressed down on the strings sharply, as if the intervals and relaxation had disappeared. Yet, Tommy's face was completely serene.

The bowing and his shoulders were more intense than ever, but the corners of his mouth were smiling.

How much time had passed? A soft period was drawn in the midst of a splendid finale.

If it had been a concert hall instead of a practice room, the audience's cheers and applause would have definitely poured out.

It was then.

"Your bowing is quite smooth."

It was Professor Albert, who had entered the practice room at some unknown point.

"Your position transitions are fluid, and your marcato is as thunderous as a storm."

Professor Albert gave a brief evaluation of Tommy's performance. Tommy couldn't hide his surprise. Wasn't Professor Albert known for being not only laconic but also notoriously prickly?

Tommy had never heard such high praise from Professor Albert before.

"But what piece is it?"

Professor Albert was curious. He thought it was Bach's unaccompanied cello suites, known as the Old Testament of the cello.

However, as the piece progressed, it resembled Beethoven's cello works, known as the New Testament of the cello.

But looking at its structure, it was a completely different piece.

"It's an original composition."

"An original composition?"

Professor Albert's eyes widened. It was undoubtedly an outstanding cello piece, even from his perspective. To exaggerate, it made his heart pound as much as when he heard Rachmaninoff's cello sonata.

It was this good even unaccompanied. If a piano accompaniment were added, it would be even more remarkable. But could Tommy really have composed such a piece? As if reading Professor Albert's thoughts, Tommy spoke.

"Actually, it's more like the melody created the structure, and I added the flesh. Initially, I went to ask for an arrangement, but with the help of the melody, a completely different piece was completed."

Professor Albert nodded purely. If it was the melody, it was possible. But Tommy, who could perform this well, was also incredible. Surely, the melody had been an enormous stroke of luck for Tommy.

"Tommy, are you done with practice?"

After the practice room performance, Tommy met Sabrina. In a way, they were one of the official couples recognized by the Royal College of Music. They hadn't said they were dating, but they always stuck together like a pair of mandarin ducks.

"Yes, Professor Albert watched me today. I didn't even know when he entered the practice room. I played the piece I composed with the melody, and Professor Albert was so surprised. Sabrina, you should have seen his face."

"Was it that surprising?"

"I was surprised too, playing it for the first time today. I didn't think it would be this good."

Composition and performance were closely related yet entirely different fields. Even if the notes on the staff were the same, they could sound completely different depending on the performer's inclination.

"Sabrina, what do you think of the melody as a musician?"

"He's amazing. I've never seen anyone as talented as him. He was one of the few who understood my music at the Royal College of Music. Of course, Tommy, you're one of those people too, so don't be disappointed. It's just that the melody was the fastest."

"If you compare him to the musicians recorded in history, who would he be as talented as?"

Although they couldn't meet the figures from classical history, their talents were described in detail through historical anecdotes.

Sabrina thought deeply and then mentioned a great name from classical history.

"Is he the reincarnation of Mozart or what?"

Elnon couldn't take her eyes off the screen with her mouth agape.

She had been very curious about a violinist named Hyun. Hollywood directors couldn't praise him enough, and even the broadcasting station officials were enchanted by him.

She immediately contacted her manager to request video materials on the violinist Hyun.

Let's see how good he is.

How exceptional must his performance be for people to praise him so much?

Elnon's curiosity didn't last long. From the first DVD, she couldn't close her mouth.

A boy who seemed barely ten years old was confidently playing the violin on the final stage of the Queen Elisabeth Competition.

The melody was so outstanding that Elnon, sitting beyond the screen, got goosebumps.

"What is this?"

The more she watched the videos, the more speechless she became. Especially the performance at the British Royal Concert was nothing short of a highlight. He didn't just show his prowess as a violinist but also as a conductor.

Despite the presence of the Queen of England and notable figures from British society, he didn't seem intimidated at all.

Rather, the older and more experienced members of the orchestra seemed more nervous.

The boy holding the baton was no longer just a boy. He commanded everyone as if he were a general on a battlefield.

Gulp―!

Elnon's throat bobbed noticeably. The more she learned about Kang Hyun, the more amazed she became. Even to her, a layperson in classical music, the performance videos were astonishing.

Elnon couldn't help but be surprised when she saw Kang Hyun's profile prepared by her manager.

Starting with the youngest win at the Queen Elisabeth Competition, he had received countless invitations from the London Symphony, the Berlin Philharmonic, and even performances at the British Royal Concert.

"Wow."

Even seasoned maestros would find it hard to achieve such a career, but this young man had done it all by the age of 20. It was then.

Ding-dong.

The doorbell rang, followed by a knock. It was Elnon's manager, who was a large man.

He had come to give additional materials about Kang Hyun that Elnon had requested.

"Elnon, there's a lot of material. I even brought a documentary tape filmed in Korea."

It was as if the manager had brought an entire biography of Kang Hyun in his thick arms. But as soon as Elnon saw the manager, she immediately asked.

"Palm, where is the violinist Hyun right now?"

"Pardon?"

"You must know his whereabouts, right?"

"Well, originally, he was known for not showing up much, but for some reason, he is said to be attending a party hosted by Boss today. It seems he has a connection with someone there."

"Are you talking about the magazine Boss? The one that sent me an invitation before?"

It was unexpected news. Boss magazine was one of the leading fashion magazines in America. Without hesitation, Elnon stood up from her seat.

"A charity event party, huh...?"

Kang Hyun looked down at the invitation he had received. It was for a charity event hosted by the magazine "Boss" to celebrate the end of the year.

Normally, Kang Hyun would have avoided such troublesome events. But hadn't Im Hyera, the director, made a sincere request?

"Boss" had published many favorable columns about Kang Hyun and was expected to be a future business partner, so she had asked him to attend the party at least once. Besides, since it was a charity event, it had a good meaning.

"Hing, I want to go to the Boss party too."

"Yooha, you have to go to school."

"Winter break is just around the corner, why do they have to do it so early!"

"But today, you have no morning classes, so you get to go to school with oppa in the afternoon. High school students in Korea wake up at dawn to prepare for their college entrance exams."

"I also study late into the night every day!"

Yooha pouted her lips. Kang Hyun smiled lightly and adjusted his clothes.

Kang Hyun personally took Yooha to school. Before she got out of the car, he didn't forget to pat her head.

Then he drove straight to the venue of the charity event.

It was an outdoor party venue located near Central Park. Perhaps because it was a charity event, the party culture he knew of in America seemed quite different.

"Hyun―!"

Miguel, the editor-in-chief of Boss, widened his eyes and hurriedly greeted Kang Hyun. He was so surprised that he even covered his mouth with his hands.

After all, editor-in-chief Miguel had sent numerous love calls to Kang Hyun. He had always wanted to do a photo shoot with Kang Hyun, even if it was just one cut.

"I never dreamed you would come. Mrs. Im did say you might attend, but I never expected to meet you here!"

Miguel's face was full of excitement. It wasn't just Miguel. When Kang Hyun arrived at the party, other people recognized his face and kept glancing at him.

There were even quite a few people who approached and greeted him first. Among them were famous Hollywood actors and models who had graced Boss.

"Even a senator is here?"

Kang Hyun was amazed at the scale of the party. There were even people who would later become prominent figures in America.

That middle-aged man with a balding head and a kind face would later rise as a key figure in the White House. He was a person Kang Hyun often saw on the news in his past life, so he recognized him quickly.

It was then.

"Hyun, Hyun?"

At the sound of a voice that seemed twisted, Kang Hyun turned his head. At first, he thought it was a drunk person's voice, but it wasn't. The other person was just so nervous in front of Kang Hyun that they stammered.

When Kang Hyun saw who it was, he looked surprised and puzzled.

"Elnon Fox?"

It was Elnon Fox, the host of the Elnon Show and a famous comedian in America. Who would have thought that Elnon would know him?

"I'm really a fan! Please, just call me Elnon!"

Elnon, contrary to her image, was trembling as she greeted Kang Hyun. Anyone who saw them would think Kang Hyun was her first love, given how emotional she was.

The more Kang Hyun conversed with Elnon, the more he realized how much she knew about him. She recited his career as if she had memorized it.

"I didn't expect you to attend the Boss charity event. I heard you don't particularly like crowded places."

"It's a charity event for children with cancer. Since it's a party with a good cause, I had to attend. Plus, I have an important role in today's charity event."

"An important role?"

At Elnon's inquiry, Kang Hyun pointed to a podium set up in a corner of the party venue and answered quietly.

"I'm in charge of the performance. Actually, even the editor-in-chief doesn't know yet. Only a few people from the organizers know. Since you’re the host of the talk show I’ll be appearing on, I'm telling you in advance."

A performance by Kang Hyun! Elnon felt her heart pounding already.

"Shall we take a look at the stage together?"

It was then.

Oh...?!

While walking and talking with Kang Hyun, Elnon sprained her ankle. As Elnon's body tilted, Kang Hyun didn't miss it and wrapped his arm around her waist. For a moment, Elnon's blue eyes met Kang Hyun's deep gaze.

'He really is enchanting.'

Elnon swallowed and cleared her thoughts.

But facing this deep gaze, she felt she could understand why this young Asian man was called the enchanting man not only in America but also in Europe.
