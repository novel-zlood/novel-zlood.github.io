The difference between a lecture and a presentation is simple. A lecture can be described as the dissemination of professional knowledge, while a presentation can be seen as sharing a sincere, personal story. Of course, in a broad sense, a lecture is an inclusive concept of a presentation. The 'sincerity' mentioned here does not refer to an emotionally charged voice. It means giving the listener trust and confidence, that is the key point.

“Please play once.”

A young man, who seemed to have become a guinea pig, sat in front of the piano. His face was obviously tense. It was understandable, as countless audience members were watching the stage. Furthermore, they were not just any ordinary audience but fellow students studying music together. Gathering all the students of the Moscow Conservatory was no different, so unless he had a heart made of iron or was a natural-born liar, it would be impossible not to feel the pressure.

“Shall I really play?”

“It’s okay, relax and try it.”

The piece the young man played was Mozart's Piano Sonata. The adagio of Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 17 in Bb major, with its serene atmosphere, was impressive. As expected of a student from the Moscow Conservatory, the tension vanished like a lie as soon as his long fingers touched the keys. However, as he entered the third movement, the devices arranged by Mozart did not work effectively. At that moment, the young man’s brow furrowed due to a fleeting mistake.

‘Hmm.’

Like the brown-haired young man encountered a few days ago, there was a problem. The 20th-century pianist Artur Schnabel said that Mozart's piano sonatas are too easy for children and too difficult for adults. The mysterious sheet music had few dynamic and pedal markings and many abstract musical symbols. It was the opposite of the style of the great Beethoven.

“From now on, you will play with me. Place your right hand on mine. Breathe with your left hand as usual, and I will handle the pedaling, so keep your leg close to my thigh. Think of it as drawing a picture. Feel like you are sprinkling and sketching the notes on the staff.”

It was not for nothing that the pianist was called to the stage. The audience of the presentation valued visual effects. Especially in front of such a large audience, a single impactful moment was more important than just speaking correctly.

After straightening the tense young man's back, I made eye contact with him. The audience still looked uncertain. I smiled slightly and placed my right hand on the keys.

“Shall we start?”

If asked how to interpret Mozart's abstract musical symbols, there was no way to answer. It just seemed that way.

It didn’t take long for the puzzled gazes to turn into astonishment. The little ghost, once only a rumor, had become a reality.

“Did you study piano for a long time before learning the violin?”

It was someone’s question. Everyone nodded in agreement with the question. It must have been a fascinating sight for them. A violinist instantly correcting a pianist’s mistake and fixing it.

“No, I studied various instruments while learning composition. Instead of expressing tones with a synthesizer, I found it more appealing to express each tone by playing it myself. Ideally, I would like to play the orchestra with my own hands. It’s something anyone studying music would have imagined.”

The glances that followed were like watching an extraordinary creature.

“What were you thinking when you entered the competition in Brussels?”

That freckled friend must be a violinist. One could tell just by looking at the calluses on the palm.

What was I thinking? Everyone seemed to expect a certain answer.

“In the endless dawn, we explored the score. The Chappelle, known as the dawn of melody, gave us great inspiration and helped us gain new insights. I wished that time would never end. I think Anna, the violinist sitting in front, felt the same. We took a step forward as musicians that day.”

Of course, I couldn’t say it was because of the military service exemption.

“What do you think of him?”

Green eyes trembled slightly.

“When I first saw him, I felt nothing. In fact, I didn’t have the mind to care about him because I hated entering the competition so much. Competing with others through music was difficult for me. Most violinists probably felt the same way. No wonder those who won international competitions all said, ‘I’m glad I don’t have to enter competitions anymore.’”

If Beethoven’s sheet music feels like reading an essay, Mozart’s sheet music feels like reading a mystery novel. Violinists rely on their strings and bows to interpret the centuries-old sheet music that feels like an endless maze. The pressure they felt participating in competitions amidst the discord of music and competition was indescribable.

“Everyone hated competing through music, but paradoxically, they tried to beat others. But he was different. He said it was his first competition, but he handled it like he had experienced it a hundred times. He was the youngest among us but the deepest thinker. How was his skill?”

Anna recalled feeling like she was standing in front of a master when she first met him. The aura that emanated from his small body was so intense that she still remembered it vividly. Musicians from around the world were astonished by his performance, so there was no need to say more.

“He helped us selflessly. It was like saving young lambs crying out in the discord of music and competition. He even made funny faces to ease my nervousness when my legs trembled so much that I couldn’t go on stage wearing heels.”

I had participated in many competitions, but it was the first time I experienced such a situation. He was the only one truly making music in the paradoxical situation where everyone aimed to win through music. On the last day of the competition, everyone was regretful. It wasn’t because they didn’t achieve satisfactory results. Rather, it was because it was time to part ways with him.

“The days in Brussels were too short to fully know him. In fact, I even prayed that the competition wouldn’t end because I wanted to spend more time with him. Even the prickly William from England must have felt the same. You saw the video of him crying, didn’t you? The fact is, everyone, regardless of gender, was captivated by him. How about me?”

Her platinum blonde hair swayed as if expressing her emotions. “Of course, I fell for him.”

Clatter—

The sound of a teacup being put down was louder than usual.

“He must be at the airport by now?”

Alexei’s raised eyebrows twitched as if in regret. Anton, the department head sitting opposite, looked at him with a peculiar smile.

“Alexei, are you that regretful?”

“What’s there to regret!”

“Don’t try to hide it. Your face clearly shows your regret.”

It was a story that would have surprised others. The change in Alexei’s expression was so subtle that only someone who had known him for a long time could notice it. For example, if his cheeks twitched downward, he was clearly angry, but if they twitched upward, he was interested.

Someone once said that Alexei, the great Russian, should have been a politician rather than a music director. However, even his poker face was filled with regret. The reason was simple.

“I wanted to get up from my seat and go on stage several times while watching his presentation. Even Professor Auer, who taught Jascha Heifetz, couldn’t have controlled the stage so effectively. Didn’t countless audience members get mesmerized by his gestures? If it were up to me, I would have hired him as a full-time professor right away. But having such a brilliant musician teach students is a sin. In the past, musicians taught students out of hunger. There’s even a saying that if Mozart had spent less time teaching aristocrats, the history of music would have advanced a step further.”

As long as a musician has strong shoulders and fingers, their performance must continue. However, the presentation was so outstanding that it was already being talked about within the Moscow Conservatory. It was transforming from the legend of the little ghost to the legend of the little genius. No wonder there were already numerous petitions for a repeat presentation.

“By the way, isn’t it time to give Anna a lesson? Every time I see her, I am amazed by your passion. Since Tchaikovsky, no music director has directly taught undergraduate students. Honestly, I was surprised. I didn’t expect you to put so much effort into nurturing students. But are you still regretful?”

Alexei silently picked up the teacup. He was regretful, but what could he do? The bus had already left. Moreover, even if he tried to hold him back, he wouldn’t be the type to be held back. At that moment, a knock was heard from beyond the door.

“It must be Anna.”

However, contrary to expectations, the person who opened the door and entered was not Anna.

“Doctor—!”

I unknowingly raised my voice. We almost collided with an oncoming car as we crossed the central line. Dr. Tikhonov waved his hand as if to say not to worry, smiling.

I should have known better than to ride in the talkative doctor's beloved car. Given its old age, comparable to Cuba’s classic cars, combined with his reckless driving, I couldn’t tell if I was in a car or on a thrill ride. Ah, look ahead, not behind! Judging by my sweat-soaked shirt, one would think I had been caught in a downpour.

“Good job, Black Martin!”

As soon as we arrived at the airport, Dr. Tikhonov patted his beloved car, praising it. My father headed straight to the restroom, probably feeling nauseous. If the talkative doctor ever got scouted by Dongju Chemical, I would never ride in his car again.

“Mr. Kang, would you like to go to a restaurant that serves excellent borscht and pelmeni?”

It was traditional Russian home cooking, equivalent to our soybean paste stew and handmade dumplings. My father, still pale from the ride, politely declined with a forced smile. He likely hadn’t shaken off the lingering effects of Black Martin. Thus, we settled for simple toast and coffee as we waited for our tickets.

“By the way, does Hyun already have a knack for charming women?”

What was he talking about now?

“When our research institute staff heard that Hyun was returning to Korea, they were all upset. The fresh energy he brought had revitalized them. If I hadn’t stopped them, some of the doctors might have boarded the plane to Korea with him.”

Contrary to the talkative doctor’s words, I had simply asked the research staff a lot of questions. They must have found the sight of a bright child endearing. As my orange juice ran out, it was almost time for ticketing.

“We look forward to seeing you again in Korea, Mr. Kang.”

Just before ticketing, Dr. Tikhonov warmly shook hands with my father and looked fondly at me.

“Hyun—!”

From afar, a familiar voice called out. Naturally, both the doctor and my father turned their gazes. Huh? Running towards us, out of breath, was a platinum blonde with skin as white as a porcelain doll and green eyes that could rival a movie star’s.

“Anna?”

“Hyun, I came in such a hurry that I didn’t even bring a gift. I never thought you’d leave so soon, really...”

Her tender-hearted nature hadn’t changed. I thanked Anna for seeing me off, holding her cold hands. Her heartbeat was almost audible, having run so fast. It reminded me of our last meeting in Brussels, where we also exchanged farewells. At that moment,

“Thank you for coming to Moscow, Hyun.”

Smooch.

Anna suddenly kissed my cheek lightly. It happened in an instant. Why did I feel a cold sweat run down my back?

My father, watching the scene, said one thing in Korean.

“Hyun, I’ll keep it a secret.”

I think I know whom he is referring to.
