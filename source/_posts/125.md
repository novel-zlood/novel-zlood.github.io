Second Movement, Andante con moto.

Slowly but lively―!

The conductor's fingertips created ripples on the calm lakeside.

The viola and cello were the first to respond to Kang Hyun's conducting.

It was a start with a soft and calm melody, contrasting with the beginning of the first movement that seems to knock on the door of fate. The smooth flow that continues with the development of the strings and woodwinds is as warm as a child's first steps.

Concertmaster Dmitry smiled faintly at the pleasant excitement. Wasn't he the one facing the conductor at the forefront of the strings?

Kang Hyun's figure came into clearer and more intense focus. It was surprising that he performed from memory on his first stage, and there was no sign of trembling to be seen. Moreover, he wouldn't even glance at the members if they made a mistake, like a ghost.

The conductor's ability varies depending on how many orchestras they've experienced. When you first step onto the conductor's podium, it feels like you're standing in the middle of a battlefield due to the myriad of instrumental melodies, making it understandable why most conductors say they don't want to remember their debut performance.

It's more accurate to say they don't remember what and how they did, but Kang Hyun was different.

‘Cello―!’

He skillfully led the variations, paying attention to even the smallest details.

It was as if he had been conducting for a long time in Dresden, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the Vienna Philharmonic. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that his eyes and ears encompassed the entire orchestra.

Beethoven, Symphony No. 5.

It was a symphony of such high difficulty that it could be described as a forced march. No wonder conductors both love and dread Beethoven the most.

Kang Hyun's fingertips were absorbing the genius Beethoven with his entire body. The baton moved sharply as if not wanting to miss a single neurotic and sensitive note.

Gulp.

Maestro Spencer opened his eyes wide with sweaty palms. The thought of judging had long since vanished.

All his nerves were on edge, wondering how Kang Hyun would lead the Symphony No. 5. The same went for the London Symphony Orchestra.

Allegro.

From the conductor's intense fingertips,

the musical ideas began to soar again.

Dudududung―!

At that moment, all the anticipation of the third movement swelled and exploded like an active volcano. The London Symphony no longer thought of Kang Hyun as a first-time conductor.

The end of Kang Hyun's baton intensely cut through the musical ideas, and his fierce gaze coordinated the melody as if piercing through the core. It was palpable how dozens of members were all excited together.

As the baton once again forcefully cut through the musical ideas, the fierce beating of the timpani and the brilliant finale of the strings reached the ceiling of Barbican Hall like light breaking through the darkness.

Crunch―!

Yuri, the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic, harshly rolled up a magazine. It was crumpled so badly it could be used as kindling right away.

Through the mangled magazine, the face of London's Spencer could be seen.

“Such a sneaky old raccoon!”

“Maestro?”

“No, I got a bit excited.”

Concertmaster Samuel looked puzzled at the maestro's sudden outburst. Wasn't he someone who rarely showed emotional fluctuations, to the point where there was almost no change in his expression? Even if a member played out of tune, he would only open his eyes sharply, never raising his voice.

“London made the first move. Look at this article.”

“A new wave flows in the London Symphony? Maestro, what does this mean?”

“It means they want to teach Hyun how to conduct over there too.”

“What?”

Samuel raised his voice without realizing it. He couldn't understand what the maestro was saying. Who was teaching whom to conduct?

Like the Berlin Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra is also among the world's top orchestras. To conduct a world-renowned orchestra requires not only grueling effort but also extensive experience.

Moreover, it was unheard of for Maestro Spencer, the heart of the London Symphony, to teach someone. He was as much of a perfectionist as Maestro Yuri.

“Maestro, wasn't Hyun supposed to visit London and Berlin as a violinist?”

“Samuel, that child's talent isn't limited to just the violin.”

“What do you mean?”

Yuri had briefly taught Kang Hyun conducting during his sabbatical. It wasn't advanced techniques but basic conducting.

It takes a long time to conduct a 4/4 beat with harmony and rhythm without being clumsy.

But Kang Hyun was different. Didn't he instantly absorb Yuri's know-how like a sponge soaking up water?

“Maestro, even if the principal conductor of the London Symphony teaches Hyun, the members won't accept it. You know our side is the same. There are many who can't even acknowledge Hyun as a violinist, let alone a conductor. Even Dmitry, the nickname cold-blooded, won't stand still. His nickname isn't cold-blooded for nothing.”

“No, since the London Symphony has already collaborated with Hyun, they might have accepted him much faster than we did. Just like how Mozart could perform in front of the Queen of Schönbrunn at the age of six because those who valued his musical talent, not his age, were there.”

Samuel couldn't speak any further. Maestro Yuri's expression was too serious.

If someone else had praised violinist Hyun this much, it would have been dismissed as exaggerated words.

It was because violinist Hyun was so young.

At the same time, he was curious. What kind of person could have fascinated the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic this much?

* * *

“You were incredible, Hyun―!”

Even though the conducting was over, the trembling in my chest didn't stop.

The members lightly tapped their stands with their bows or stomped their feet to show their applause. In all my past and present lives, I had never been this nervous. It didn't show on my face, but my back was already drenched in sweat.

At that moment.

Clap―!

A single member of the audience stood up and gave a standing ovation. A subtle smile appeared on the maestro's face.

To be honest, even though I started confidently, I was so flustered at times. The expression “battlefield” was perfectly fitting. The melodies appeared like bombs falling here and there.

It was only after stepping down from the conductor's podium that I realized I had won the battle.

“Hyun, where did you learn to conduct?”

“Yeah, we're really curious too. I made a bet with Emanuel. I bet beer tonight that you learned conducting directly from a renowned Asian maestro in Korea.”

“Michael, I told you, Hyun didn't learn from anyone. He definitely taught himself.”

Emanuel and Michael were bickering, making a sort of bet. Others also seemed very curious.

Naturally, they were surprised that someone who hadn't held a baton for a week could conduct so skillfully. Even Dmitry was pricking up his ears.

“The first person who taught me conducting was Maestro Yuri.”

At that moment, Barbican Hall seemed to be filled with silence.

It was a fact that would be revealed anyway. Maestro Spencer must have already known. It was true that he was the one who first taught me the basics of conducting.

“W-wait, are you talking about the lion of the Berlin Philharmonic?”

“Yes, Emanuel.”

“Oh my gosh. We've been raising a tiger cub from Berlin―!”

Emanuel looked surprised as if facing a twist on par with The Sixth Sense. The other members were the same.

The first to move among them was none other than concertmaster Dmitry.

“Hyun, let's draft up the contract first.”

“Contract?”

“Maybe Berlin taught you to conduct first, but the one who will sign the contract first will be London.”

Are they trying to recruit me as a guest violinist, or as a conductor? I couldn't sign anything without knowing.

For a joke, Dmitry's cold eyes were as piercing as a cold-blooded person. Then, a savior appeared in Barbican Hall.

“Everyone, have some snacks and then practice―!”

The queen of support appeared, carrying food in both hands.

* * *

On a holiday, we headed to the outskirts of London, passing through pastures where sheep roamed. Of course, Krissy was in the driver's seat.

I'd love to drive on the open road, but who would let me? Despite my years of accident-free driving experience.

“Oppa, I'm still not really over it.”

Well, Son Yooha, the ice queen, was sticking right next to me. She seemed upset that I didn't seat her in the audience when conducting Symphony No. 5. But since it was a test, her pouty face probably wouldn’t last long.

“Yooha, are you going to Berlin too?”

“Oppa, I'm busy too, you know. I have to go back to America from London―!”

“Really?”

To be honest, I was worried she might cling to me like a gumdrop all summer. Though I appreciated her visiting, it was a bit burdensome.

“I'll be so busy that I won't be able to visit you in Korea often either.”

“Huh?”

“So don't you dare look at anyone else.”

Why do I feel a chill down my spine?

Yooha would soon start her succession lessons for becoming the heir of a conglomerate. She would finish college in America and return to Korea to join Jeil Trading. It was the beginning of the legend of the ice queen.

“We're here.”

At Krissy's words, I looked out the window to see a wide coastline. Unlike Korea, there were no clam bake shops or parasols.

The pebble beach was filled only with a sense of leisure.

“Oppa, if you make a wish and throw bread here, seagulls will suddenly appear and take it away.”

“Seagulls?”

“Yeah, if they take it away at once, your wish will definitely come true.”

No matter how hard I looked around, I couldn't see a single seagull feather. Even though it was August, it was like spring in London, so it was hard to find people enjoying a picnic.

Then, Son Yooha took out two small pieces of bread from her bag.

“Here, oppa.”

“For me?”

“Yeah, I'm going to make a wish too, so you should too. You go first.”

Is this the saying that even cold water should be taken from the top? Yooha looked at me with eyes full of expectation. But no matter how much she expected, there was no way an invisible seagull would appear.

Thud.

The piece of bread fell on the pebbles with an empty echo. It was an awkward moment. But it wasn't my fault. I never expected to wait for a seagull on my first vacation in both my past and present lives.

Then, Yooha shouted at me.

“Oppa, you have to say your wish out loud before you throw it―!”

“Isn’t it enough to say it to myself?”

“No, you have to say it out loud.”

Who says?

Krissy, who was following us from a distance, awkwardly rubbed her nose.

It must have been a legend told by Denzel Washington's bodyguard, who claimed to be a London native. It felt even more absurd than throwing a coin into the Trevi Fountain.

When Krissy made eye contact with me, she kept looking around, muttering to herself, “There used to be many seagulls here.”

I was about to humor Yooha’s mood and head back.

“Oppa, I hope all your wishes come true―!”

Huh?

Yooha threw the piece of bread high into the sky.

Flap―!

At that moment, a white seagull appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the piece of bread.

Yooha jumped up and down and hugged me, as if she knew it would happen. Krissy also seemed relieved that the seagull had appeared, praying.

I was simply dumbfounded. It felt like a scene from a movie.
