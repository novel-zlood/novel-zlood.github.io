# Transparency

All translation in this site is done using OpenAI's gpt-4o model. As everything here is mainly for my own consumption, I did simple paraphrase when I realized there is a glaring error. If the error is consistent, I add extra instruction to the prompt to let the model avoid this error for subsequent chapter.

I acquire the chapters myself for around 100 KRW each chapter. If anyone supported me on ko-fi, I will spend that to acquire chapters of [IWLAAA](/iwlaaa) until all chapters are acquired. Any ko-fi sent after that will be used to cover OpenAI's bill. Any ko-fi after that will be used to start new series. The cost of gpt-4o to translate one chapter is between 0.05 - 0.09 USD depending on length. So far I have spent 17.77 USD for everything hosted here.

When any series hosted here got official english translation, I will take down chapters to avoid infringement.

This site is a [hexo](http://hexo.io) site hosted on Github pages. Hexo is a static page framework, which means all pages hosted here is a static text file and doesn't need database to store those pages. It allows hexo sites to be fast. The absence of database also means the absence of ability to store user data. The commenting capability provided here is stored as github issues. Anyone wanting to comment need to login to Github, and your user account info is managed by Github. Github pages doesn't support cookie, therefore no user tracking can be done.

Having said that, I setup this site with simpleanalytics (http://simpleanalytics.com) - a privacy-first google analytics alternative. I used them to know some basic metric that can help me improve this site, such as how long average user spend in a page, or how they are coming to this site (google search, novelupdates, etc). I setup the simple analytics data to be public and you can see it here: [https://dashboard.simpleanalytics.com/novel-zlood.github.io](https://dashboard.simpleanalytics.com/novel-zlood.github.io).

As a github pages site, the hexo source code to build this site is public, and you can obtain it by cloning the repo. Just take note that the source code is covered by MIT Open Source license.
